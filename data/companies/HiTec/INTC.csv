These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Refer also to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" and our financial statements and the related notes.Changes in product demand can adversely affect our financial results.Demand for our products is variable and hard to predict. Changes in the demand for our products may reduce our revenue, increase our costs, lower our gross margin percentage, or require us to write down the value of our assets. Our platform products are used across different market segments, and demand for our platforms may vary within or among our client computing, data center, Internet of Things, and other market segments. It is difficult to anticipate the impact of these changes, as demand may increase in one or more market segments while decreasing in others. Important factors that could lead to variation in the demand for our products include changes in:•business conditions, including downturns in the computing industry, or in the global or regional economies;•consumer confidence or income levels caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in government borrowing, taxation, or spending policies; the credit market; or expected inflation, employment, and energy or other commodity prices;•the level of our customers’ inventories;•competitive and pricing pressures, including actions taken by competitors;•customer product needs;•market acceptance and industry support of our new and maturing products; and•the technology supply chain, including supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events.We face significant competition. The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market developments, changes in industry standards, changes in customer needs, and frequent product introductions and improvements. If we do not anticipate and respond to these developments, our competitive position may weaken, and our products or technologies might be uncompetitive or obsolete. Additionally, a number of business combinations, including mergers, asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships, in the semiconductor industry have occurred over the last several years, and more could occur in the future. Consolidation in the industry could lead to fewer customers, partners or suppliers, any of which could negatively affect our financial results. In recent years, our business focus has expanded and now includes the design and production of platforms and other products for the data center, Internet of Things, and memory market segments, including FPGA products, connectivity products, and a number of other products and services for a wide range of connected devices. As a result, we face new sources of competition, including, in certain of these market segments, from incumbent competitors with established customer bases and greater brand recognition. To be successful, we need to cultivate new industry relationships with customers and partners in these market segments. In addition, we must continually improve the cost, integration, and energy efficiency of our products, as well as expand our software capabilities to provide customers with comprehensive computing solutions. Despite our ongoing efforts, there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain consumer and market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments.15Table of ContentsTo compete successfully, we must maintain a successful R&D effort, develop new products and production processes, and improve our existing products and processes ahead of competitors. For example, we invest substantially in our network of manufacturing and assembly and test facilities, including the construction of new fabrication facilities to support smaller transistor geometries and larger wafers. Our R&D efforts are critical to our success and are aimed at solving complex problems, and we do not expect all of our projects to be successful. We may be unable to develop and market new products successfully, and the products we invest in and develop may not be well-received by customers. Our R&D investments may not generate significant operating income or contribute to our future operating results for several years, and such contributions may not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments. Additionally, the products and technologies offered by others may affect demand for, or pricing of, our products.If we are not able to compete effectively, our financial results will be adversely affected, including increased costs and reduced revenue and gross margin, and we may be required to accelerate the write-down of the value of certain assets. Changes in the mix of products sold may harm our financial results. Our pricing and margins vary across our products and market segments due to differences in product features or manufacturing costs. For example, our platform product offerings range from lower-priced and entry-level platforms, such as those based on Intel Quark or Intel Atom processors, to higher-end platforms based on Intel Xeon processors. If demand shifts from our higher-priced to lower-priced platforms in any of our market segments, our gross margin and revenue would decrease. In addition, when products are introduced, they tend to have higher costs because of initial development costs and lower production volumes relative to the previous product generation, which can impact gross margin.We operate globally and are subject to significant risks in many jurisdictions.Global or regional conditions may harm our financial results. We have manufacturing, assembly and test, R&D, sales, and other operations in many countries, and some of our business activities may be concentrated in one or more geographic areas. Moreover, sales outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 78% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. As a result, our operations and our financial results, including our ability to manufacture, assemble and test, design, develop, or sell products, may be adversely affected by a number of factors outside of our control, including:•global and local economic conditions;•geopolitical and security issues, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, crime, political instability, human rights concerns, and terrorist activity;•natural disasters, public health issues, and other catastrophic events;•inefficient infrastructure and other disruptions, such as supply chain interruptions and large-scale outages or unreliable provision of services from utilities, transportation, data hosting, or telecommunications providers;•government restrictions on, or nationalization of our operations in any country, or restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings from a particular country;•differing employment practices and labor issues; •formal or informal imposition of new or revised export and/or import and doing-business regulations, including trade sanctions and tariffs, which could be changed without notice;•ineffective legal protection of our IP rights in certain countries; •local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices; and•increased uncertainty regarding social, political, immigration and trade policies in the U.S. and abroad, such as recent U.S. legislation and policies and the United Kingdom's referendum to withdraw from the European Union (""Brexit"").We are subject to laws and regulations worldwide, which may differ among jurisdictions, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to: IP ownership and infringement; tax; import and export requirements; anti-corruption; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; anti-competition; advertising; employment; product regulations; environment, health, and safety requirements; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements may be onerous and expensive, and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively. Although we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, and/or agents will not violate such laws or our policies. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation.16Table of ContentsWe may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency exchange rates. Although most of our sales occur in U.S. dollars, expenses may be paid in local currencies. An increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the U.S. where we sell in dollars, and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of expenses such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, as well as overseas capital expenditures. We also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements; therefore, changes in exchange rates could harm our results of operations and financial condition.Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. Our operations or systems could be disrupted by natural disasters; industrial accidents; geopolitical conditions; terrorist activity; public health issues; cybersecurity incidents; interruptions of service from utilities, transportation, or telecommunications providers; or other catastrophic events. Such events could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver products to our customers, receive production materials from our suppliers, or perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. While we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to enable us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business, some of our systems are not fully redundant and we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disruptions. We maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks. The types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability, cost, and decisions with respect to risk retention. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions. In addition, one or more of our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.We are vulnerable to product and manufacturing-related risks. Due to the variability in demand for our products and the complexity of our manufacturing operations, we may be unable to timely respond to fluctuations in demand. Our operations have high costs that are either fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term, including our costs related to manufacturing, such as facility construction and equipment, R&D, and the employment and training of a highly skilled workforce. If product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges, which would lower our gross margin. Our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. Factory-planning decisions may shorten the useful lives of facilities and equipment and cause us to accelerate depreciation.Conversely, if product demand increases, we may be unable to add capacity fast enough to meet market demand. Our revenue and gross margin can also be affected by the timing of our product introductions and related expenses, including marketing expenses.We are subject to risks associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing process technology. We may not be successful or efficient in developing or implementing new production processes. Production of integrated circuits is a complex process. We are continually engaged in the transition from our existing process to the next-generation process technology. This consistent innovation involves significant expense and carries inherent risks, including difficulties in designing and developing next-generation process technologies, development and production timing delays, lower than anticipated manufacturing yields, and product defects and errata. Disruptions in the production process can also result from errors, defects in materials, delays in obtaining or revising operating permits and licenses, interruption in our supply of materials or resources, and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents, maintenance issues, or unsafe working conditions—all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields. Production issues can lead to increased costs and may affect our ability to meet product demand, which could adversely impact our business and the results from operations.17Table of ContentsWe face supply chain risks. Thousands of suppliers provide materials and equipment that we use in production and other aspects of our business. Where possible, we seek to have several sources of supply for all of those materials. However, for certain materials, we may rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single location. In addition, consolidation among suppliers could impact the nature, quality, availability, and pricing of the products and services available to us. The inability of suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt our production processes or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy. Production could be disrupted by the unavailability of resources used in production, such as water, silicon, electricity, gases, and other materials. The unavailability or reduced availability of materials or resources may require us to reduce production or incur additional costs, which could harm our business and results of operations. Our manufacturing operations and ability to meet product demand may also be impacted by IP or other litigation between our suppliers, where an injunction against Intel or a supplier could interrupt the availability of goods or services supplied to Intel by others.We also rely on third-party providers to manufacture and assemble and test certain components or products, particularly those related to networking, mobile and communications, programmable semiconductor solutions, and NAND flash memory. If any of these third parties are unable to perform these services on a timely or cost-effective basis, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions that could adversely affect our financial results.In addition, there are regulatory and other requirements, restrictions, and requests from various constituencies regarding sourcing practices and supplier conduct, with a trend toward expanding the scope of materials and locations where materials originate, regulating supplier behaviors, and increasing the required disclosures regarding such matters by public companies. Increased regulation and public pressure in this area would cause our compliance costs to increase and could negatively affect our reputation given that we use many materials in the manufacturing of our products and rely on many suppliers to provide these materials, but do not directly control their procurement or employment practices.We are subject to the risks of product defects, errata or other product issues. Product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications) may result from problems in our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test processes. Components and products we purchase or license from third-party suppliers, or attain through acquisitions, may also contain defects. We could face risks if products that we design, manufacture or sell, or that include our technology, cause personal injury or property damage, even where the cause is unrelated to product defects or errata. These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies, or applications through the Internet of Things, including wearables, drones and transportation, and industrial and consumer uses. Costs from defects, errata, or other product issues could include:•writing off some or all of the value of inventory;•recalling products that have been shipped;•providing product replacements or modifications; •reimbursing customers for certain costs they incur; •defending against litigation and/or paying resulting damages; and•paying fines imposed by regulatory agencies.These costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin, and result in delay or loss of revenue. Any product defects, errata, or other issues could also damage our reputation, negatively affect product demand, delay product releases, or result in legal liability. The announcement of product defects or errata could cause customers to purchase products from competitors as a result of possible shortages of our components or for other reasons. Any of these occurrences could harm our business and financial results. In addition, although we maintain liability insurance, our coverage has certain exclusions and/or may not adequately cover liabilities incurred. Our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim, and losses not covered by insurance could be large, which could harm our financial condition.We are subject to risks associated with environmental laws and regulations. The manufacturing and assembly and test of our products require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in:•regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities;•suspension of production;•alteration of our manufacturing and assembly and test processes;•reputational challenges; and•restrictions on our operations or sales.18Table of ContentsOur failure to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, or disposal of hazardous materials could lead to increased costs or future liabilities. Our ability to expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future may be impeded by environmental regulations, such as air quality and wastewater requirements. Environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product designs, or incur other expenses. Many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may be subject to regulation under environmental laws and regulations. These restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processes.Climate change may also pose regulatory and environmental risks that could harm our results of operations and affect the way we conduct business. For example, climate change regulation could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution control requirements, and increased or new monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. We also see the potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations if, for example, utility companies pass on their costs to their customers. Furthermore, many of our operations are located in semi-arid regions that may become increasingly vulnerable to prolonged droughts due to climate change. Our fabrication facilities require significant water use and, while we recycle and reuse a portion of the water used, we may have difficulties obtaining sufficient water to fulfill our operational needs due the lack of available infrastructure. We are subject to IP risks and risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings.We may be unable to enforce or protect our IP rights. We regard our patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and other IP rights as important to the success of our business. We rely on IP law as well as confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers, employees, technology development partners, and others to protect our IP rights. Our ability to enforce these rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our IP rights in various countries. When we seek to enforce our rights, we may be subject to claims that the IP rights are invalid, not enforceable, or licensed to the opposing party. Our assertion of IP rights may result in the other party seeking to assert claims against us, which could harm our business. Governments may adopt regulations—and governments or courts may render decisions—requiring compulsory licensing of IP rights, or governments may require products to meet standards that serve to favor local companies. Our inability to enforce our IP rights under any of these circumstances may harm our competitive position and business. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in R&D, product development, and marketing could be reduced.Our licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives may allow competitors to use our patent rights. Companies in our industry often bilaterally license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements. Our competitors may have licenses to our patents, and under current case law, some of the licenses may exhaust our patent rights as to licensed product sales under some circumstances. Our participation in industry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives may require us to license our patents to companies that adopt industry-standard specifications. Depending on the rules of the organization, we might have to grant these licenses to our patents for little or no cost, and as a result, we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others, our costs of enforcing our licenses or protecting our patents may increase, and the value of our IP rights may be impaired.19Table of ContentsThird parties may assert claims based on IP rights against us or our products, which could harm our business. We may face claims based on IP rights from individuals and companies, including those who have acquired patent portfolios to assert claims against other companies. We are normally engaged in a number of litigation matters involving IP rights. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, whether or not meritorious, could cause us to incur large costs to respond to, defend, and resolve, and they may divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel. In addition, we may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets and other confidential business information or end-user data that we obtain in conducting our business. Any such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business, and we could suffer losses, including the cost of product recalls and returns, and reputational harm. Furthermore, we have agreed to indemnify customers for certain IP rights claims against them. As a result of IP rights claims, we could:•pay monetary damages, including payments to satisfy indemnification obligations;•stop manufacturing, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products or technology subject to claims;    •develop other products or technology not subject to claims, which could be time-consuming or costly; and/or•enter into settlement and license agreements, which agreements may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.These IP rights claims could harm our competitive position, result in expenses, or require us to impair our assets. If we alter or stop production of affected items, our revenue could be harmed.We rely on access to third-party IP, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Many of our products include third-party IP and/or implement industry standards, which may require licenses from third parties. Based on past experience and industry practice, we believe such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there is no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party IP, or to use such IP on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude us from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.We are subject to the risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings. We may face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, competition, and other issues on a global basis. As described in ""Note 20: Commitments and Contingencies"" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we are engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. In addition, regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations, and distracting to management.We must attract, retain, and motivate key employees. To be competitive, we must attract, retain, and motivate executives and other key employees. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff, and sales representatives are critical to our business, and competition for experienced employees can be intense. To help attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, we use share-based and other performance-based incentive awards such as restricted stock units (RSUs) and cash bonuses. Also key to our employee hiring and retention is our ability to build and maintain an inclusive business culture and be viewed as an employer of choice. If our share-based or other compensation programs and workplace culture cease to be viewed as competitive, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. 20Table of ContentsWe are subject to cybersecurity and privacy risks.Third parties attempt to gain unauthorized access to our network, products, services, and infrastructure. We regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet or to introduce malicious software to our information technology (IT) systems. Additionally, malicious hackers may attempt to gain unauthorized access and corrupt the processes of hardware and software products that we manufacture and services we provide. Due to the widespread use of our products and the high profile of our commercial security products, we or our products and services are a frequent target of computer hackers and organizations that intend to sabotage, take control of, or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other processes, products, and services. We are also a target of malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our customers or end users; steal proprietary information related to our business, products, employees, and customers; or interrupt our systems and services or those of our customers or others. We believe such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication. From time to time, we encounter intrusions or unauthorized access to our network, products, services, or infrastructure. To date, none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business or operations. In some instances, we, our customers, and the users of our products and services might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. While we seek to detect and investigate all unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network, products, and services, and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes to our internal processes and tools and/or changes or patches to our products and services, we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats. Such incidents, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in our incurring significant costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems, reduced inventory value, providing modifications to our products and services, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties. In addition, these threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures. Publicity about vulnerabilities and attempted or successful incursions could damage our reputation with customers or users, and reduce demand for our products and services.We may be subject to theft, loss, or misuse of personal data about our employees, customers, or other third parties, which could increase our expenses, damage our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant. In addition, even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others.We are subject to risks associated with transactions.We invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments. We make investments in public and private companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support key business initiatives. Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable at the time of our initial investment. Companies in which we invest range from early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction to mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. The success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on the availability to the company of additional funding on favorable terms, or a liquidity event, such as a public offering or acquisition. If any of the companies in which we invest fail, we could lose all or part of our investment. 21Table of ContentsOur acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions could fail to achieve strategic objectives, disrupt our ongoing business, and harm our results of operations. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate opportunities, and enter into agreements for possible acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions, such as joint ventures. Given that our resources are limited, our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives. In addition to opportunity costs, these transactions involve large challenges and risks, including risks that:•the transaction may not advance our business strategy;•we may be unable to identify opportunities on terms acceptable to us;•we may not realize a satisfactory return;•we may experience disruption of our ongoing operations;•we may be unable to retain key personnel;•we may experience difficulty in integrating new employees, business systems, and technology; •acquired businesses may not have adequate controls, processes, and procedures to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, and our due diligence process may not identify compliance issues or other liabilities;•we may have difficulty entering new market segments; •we may be unable to retain the customers and partners of acquired businesses; and/or•there may be unknown, underestimated, and/or undisclosed commitments or liabilities.When we decide to sell assets or a business, we may have difficulty selling on acceptable terms in a timely manner, and the agreed-upon terms and financing arrangements could be renegotiated due to changes in business or market conditions. These circumstances could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional expense, or we may sell a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated, resulting in a loss on the transaction.If we do enter into agreements with respect to acquisitions, divestitures, or other transactions, we may fail to complete them due to factors such as:•failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals;    •IP disputes or other litigation; or•difficulties obtaining financing for the transaction.We are subject to sales-related risks.We face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties. We sell a significant portion of our products through third parties such as distributors, value-added resellers, and channel partners (collectively referred to as distributors) as well as OEMs, ODMs and Internet service providers. We depend on many distributors to help us create end customer demand, provide technical support and other value-added services to customers, fill customer orders, and stock our products. We may rely on one or more key distributors for a product, and a material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors or their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue. Our ability to add or replace distributors for some of our products may be limited. In addition, our distributors' expertise in the determination and stocking of acceptable inventory levels for some of our products may not be easily transferable to a new distributor; as a result, end customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a distributor. Using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks, including competitive pressure, concentration, credit risk, and compliance risks. Distributors and other third parties may sell products that compete with our products, and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to focus them on the sale of our products. They may face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business. Failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors and other third parties may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position.22Table of ContentsWe face risks related to business transactions with U.S. government entities. We receive proceeds from services and products we provide to the U.S. government. U.S. government demand and payment may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations. U.S. government contracts are subject to oversight, including special rules on accounting, IP rights, expenses, reviews, information handling, and security. Failure to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions, including termination of contracts, fines, and suspensions, or debarment from future U.S. government business.Our results of operations could vary as a result of the methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying accounting policies. The methods, estimates, and judgments used in applying accounting policies are subject to significant risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and changes that could affect our financial position and results of operations. For more information, see ""Critical Accounting Estimates"" in Part II, Item 7 and ""Note 2: Accounting Policies"" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income. A number of factors may increase our effective tax rates, which could reduce our net income, including:    •changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed;•the resolution of issues arising from tax audits;•changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances;•adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns;•increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill;•changes in available tax credits;•changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including changes in the U.S. to the taxation of manufacturing enterprises and of non-U.S. income and expenses;•changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and•our decision to repatriate non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes.We may have fluctuations in the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases. The amount, timing, and execution of our stock repurchase program may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes—such as investing in our business, including operational spending, capital spending, and acquisitions, and returning cash to our stockholders as dividend payments—and because of changes in cash flows and changes in tax laws. Workforce restructuring actions may be disruptive to our operations and adversely affect our financial results. In response to the business environment and to accomplish our strategic objectives, we have announced restructurings of our operations and have made other adjustments to our workforce. We may pursue similar actions in the future, and such workforce changes can result in restructuring charges in addition to those described in ""Note 7: Restructuring and Other Charges"" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Any such workforce changes can also temporarily reduce workforce productivity, which could be disruptive to our business and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, if our restructurings are perceived negatively, our corporate reputation and ability to attract employees could suffer. Moreover, we may not achieve or sustain the expected cost savings or other benefits of our restructuring plans, or do so within the expected time frame.Additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations with regard to our restructuring activity include:•timing and execution of plans and programs that may be subject to local labor law requirements, including consultation with appropriate works councils;•assumptions related to severance, post-retirement, and relocation costs;•future acquisitions, dispositions, or investments;•new business initiatives and changes in product roadmap, development, and manufacturing; and/or•assumptions related to cost savings, product demand, and operating efficiencies.23Table of ContentsThere are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls. We do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that resource constraints exist, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. If our controls become inadequate, we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, our reputation may be adversely affected, our business and operating results could be harmed, and the market price of our stock could decline"
3,INTC,INTEL CORP,2016-02-12,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSThe following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. You should also refer to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" and our financial statements and the related notes.Changes in product demand can harm our results of operation and financial condition.Demand for our products is variable and hard to predict. Changes in the demand for our products may reduce our revenue, increase our costs, lower our gross margin percentage, or require us to write down the value of our assets. Important factors that could lead to variation in the demand for our products include changes in:•business conditions, including downturns in the computing industry, or in the global or regional economies;•consumer confidence or income levels caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in government borrowing, taxation, or spending policies; the credit market; or expected inflation, employment, and energy or other commodity prices;•the level of our customers’ inventories;•competitive and pricing pressures, including actions taken by competitors;•customer product needs;•market acceptance and industry support of our new and maturing products; and•the technology supply chain, including supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events.We face significant competition. The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market developments, changes in industry standards, changes in customer needs, and frequent product introductions and improvements. If we do not anticipate and respond to these developments, our competitive position may weaken, and our products or technologies might be uncompetitive or obsolete. In recent years, our business focus has expanded and now includes the design and production of platforms for tablets, phones, and other devices across the compute continuum, including products for the Internet of Things, and related services. As a result, we face new sources of competition, including, in certain of these market segments, from incumbent competitors with established customer bases and greater brand recognition. To be successful, we need to cultivate new industry relationships with customers and partners in these market segments. In addition, we must continually improve the cost, integration, and energy efficiency of our products, as well as expand our software capabilities to provide customers with comprehensive computing solutions. Despite our ongoing efforts, there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain consumer and market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments.To compete successfully, we must maintain a successful R&D effort, develop new products and production processes, and improve our existing products and processes ahead of competitors. For example, we invest substantially in our network of manufacturing and assembly and test facilities, including the construction of new fabrication facilities to support smaller transistor geometries and larger wafers. Our R&D efforts are critical to our success and are aimed at solving complex problems, and we do not expect all of our projects to be successful. We may be unable to develop and market new products successfully, and the products we invest in and develop may not be well-received by customers. Our R&D investments may not generate significant operating income or contribute to our future operating results for several years, and such contributions may not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments. Additionally, the products and technologies offered by others may affect demand for, or pricing of, our products.If we are not able to compete effectively, our financial results will be adversely affected, including increased costs and reduced revenue and gross margin, and we may be required to accelerate the write-down of the value of certain assets. 20Table of ContentsChanges in the mix of products sold may harm our financial results. Prices differ widely among the platforms we offer in our various market segments due to differences in features offered or manufacturing costs. For example, product offerings range from lower-priced and entry-level platforms, such as those based on Intel Quark or Intel Atom processors, to higher-end platforms based on Intel Xeon and Intel Itanium processors. If demand shifts from our higher-priced to lower-priced platforms in any of our market segments, our gross margin and revenue would decrease. In addition, when products are introduced, they tend to have higher costs because of initial development costs and lower production volumes relative to the previous product generation, which can impact gross margin.We operate globally and are subject to significant risks in many jurisdictions.Global or regional conditions may harm our financial results. We have manufacturing, assembly and test, R&D, sales, and other operations in many countries, and some of our business activities may be concentrated in one or more geographic areas. Moreover, sales outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 80% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2015. As a result, our operations and our financial results, including our ability to manufacture, assemble and test, design, develop, or sell products, may be adversely affected by a number of factors outside of our control, including:•global and local economic conditions;•geopolitical and security issues, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, crime, political instability, and terrorist activity;•natural disasters, public health issues, and other catastrophic events;•inefficient infrastructure and other disruptions, such as supply chain interruptions and large-scale outages or unreliable provision of services from utilities, transportation, data hosting, or telecommunications providers;•government restrictions on, or nationalization of our operations in any country, or restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings from a particular country;•differing employment practices and labor issues; •formal or informal imposition of new or revised export and/or import and doing-business regulations, which could be changed without notice;•ineffective legal protection of our IP rights in certain countries; and•local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices. We are subject to laws and regulations worldwide, which may differ among jurisdictions, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to: IP ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, advertising, employment, environment, health, and safety. Compliance with such requirements may be onerous and expensive, and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively. Although we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, and/or agents will not violate such laws or our policies. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation.We may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency exchange rates. Although most of our sales occur in U.S. dollars, expenses may be paid in local currencies. An increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the U.S. where we sell in dollars, and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of expenses such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, as well as overseas capital expenditures. We also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements; therefore, changes in exchange rates could harm our results of operations and financial condition.21Table of ContentsCatastrophic events or geopolitical conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. Our operations or systems could be disrupted by natural disasters; geopolitical conditions; terrorist activity; public health issues; cybersecurity incidents; interruptions of service from utilities, transportation or telecommunications providers; or other catastrophic events. Such events could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver products to our customers, receive production materials from our suppliers, or perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. While we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to enable us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business, some of our systems are not fully redundant and we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disruptions. We maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks. The types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability, cost, and decisions with respect to risk retention. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions. In addition, one or more of our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.We operate our own fabrication facilities and, as a result, are vulnerable to manufacturing-related risks. Due to the variability in demand for our products, we may be unable to timely respond to reduce costs when demand declines or to increase production when demand increases. Our operations have high costs that are either fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term, including our costs related to manufacturing, such as facility construction and equipment, R&D, and the employment and training of a highly skilled workforce. If product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges, which would lower our gross margin. Our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. Factory-planning decisions may shorten the useful lives of facilities and equipment and cause us to accelerate depreciation.Conversely, if product demand increases, we may be unable to add capacity fast enough to meet market demand. Our revenue and gross margin can also be affected by the timing of our product introductions and related expenses, including marketing expenses.We are subject to risks associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing process technology. We may not be successful or efficient in developing or implementing new production processes. Production of integrated circuits is a complex process. We are continually engaged in the transition from our existing process to the next-generation process technology. This consistent innovation involves significant expense and carries inherent risks, including difficulties in designing and developing next-generation process technologies, development and production timing delays, lower than anticipated manufacturing yields, and product defects and errata. Disruptions in the production process can also result from errors, defects in materials, delays in obtaining or revising operating permits and licenses, interruption in our supply of materials or resources, and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents, maintenance issues, or unsafe working conditions—all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields. Production issues can lead to increased costs and may affect our ability to meet product demand, which could adversely impact our business and the results from operations.We face supply chain risks. Thousands of suppliers provide materials that we use in production and other aspects of our business. Where possible, we seek to have several sources of supply for all of those materials. However, for certain materials, we may rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single location. In addition, consolidation among suppliers could impact the nature, quality, availability, and pricing of the products and services available to us. The inability of suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt our production processes or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy. Production could be disrupted by the unavailability of resources used in production, such as water, silicon, electricity, gases, and other materials. The unavailability or reduced availability of materials or resources may require us to reduce production or incur additional costs, which could harm our business and results of operations.22Table of ContentsWe also rely on third-party providers to manufacture and assemble and test certain components or products, particularly those related to networking, mobile and communications, and NAND flash memory. If any of these third parties are unable to perform these services on a timely basis, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions that could adversely affect our financial results.In addition, there are regulatory and other requirements, restrictions, and requests from various constituencies regarding sourcing practices and supplier conduct, with a trend toward expanding the scope of materials and locations where materials originate, regulating supplier behaviors, and increasing the required disclosures regarding such matters by public companies. Increased regulation and public pressure in this area would cause our compliance costs to increase and could negatively affect our reputation given that we use many materials in the manufacturing of our products and rely on many suppliers to provide these materials, but do not directly control their procurement or employment practices.We are subject to the risks of product defects and errata. Product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications) may result from problems in our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test processes. Components and products we purchase or license from third-party suppliers may also contain defects. Costs from defects and errata could include:•writing off some or all of the value of inventory;•recalling products that have been shipped;•providing product replacements or modifications; and•defending against resulting litigation.These costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin, and result in delay or loss of revenue. Any product defects, errata, or other issues that we do not detect or fix could also damage our reputation, negatively affect product demand, delay product releases, or result in legal liability. The announcement of product defects and errata could cause customers to purchase products from competitors as a result of possible shortages of our components or for other reasons. Any of these occurrences could harm our business and financial results.We are subject to risks associated with environmental laws and regulations. The manufacturing and assembly and test of our products require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of EHS laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in:•regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities;•suspension of production;•alteration of our fabrication and assembly and test processes;•reputational challenges; and•restrictions on our operations or sales.Our failure to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, or disposal of hazardous materials could lead to increased costs or future liabilities. Our ability to expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future may be impeded by environmental regulations, such as air quality and wastewater requirements. Environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product designs, or incur other expenses. Many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may be subject to regulation under environmental laws and regulations. These restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processes.Climate change may also pose regulatory and environmental risks that could harm our results of operations and affect the way we conduct business. For example, climate change regulation could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution control requirements, and increased or new monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. We also see the potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations if, for example, utility companies pass on their costs to their customers. Furthermore, many of our operations are located in semi-arid regions that may become increasingly vulnerable to prolonged droughts due to climate change. Our fabrication facilities require significant water use and, while we recycle and reuse a portion of the water used, we may have difficulties obtaining sufficient water to fulfill our operational needs due the lack of available infrastructure. 23Table of ContentsWe are subject to IP risks and risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings.We may be unable to enforce or protect our IP rights. We regard our patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and other IP rights as important to the success of our business. We rely on IP law as well as confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers, employees, technology development partners, and others to protect our IP rights. Our ability to enforce these rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our IP rights in various countries. When we seek to enforce our rights, we may be subject to claims that the IP rights are invalid, not enforceable, or licensed to the opposing party. Our assertion of IP rights may result in the other party seeking to assert claims against us, which could harm our business. Governments may adopt regulations—and governments or courts may render decisions—requiring compulsory licensing of IP rights, or governments may require products to meet standards that serve to favor local companies. Our inability to enforce our IP rights under any of these circumstances may harm our competitive position and business. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in R&D, product development, and marketing could be reduced.Our licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives may allow competitors to use our patent rights. Companies in our industry often bilaterally license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements. Our competitors may have licenses to our patents, and under current case law, some of the licenses may exhaust our patent rights as to licensed product sales under some circumstances. Our participation in industry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives may require us to license our patents to companies that adopt industry-standard specifications. Depending on the rules of the organization, we might have to grant these licenses to our patents for little or no cost, and as a result, we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others, our costs of enforcing our licenses or protecting our patents may increase, and the value of our IP rights may be impaired.Third parties may assert claims based on IP rights against us or our products, which could harm our business. We may face claims based on IP rights from individuals and companies, including those who have acquired patent portfolios to assert claims against other companies. We are normally engaged in a number of litigation matters involving IP rights. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, whether or not meritorious, could cause us to incur large costs to respond to, defend, and resolve, and they may divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel. In addition, we may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets and other confidential business information or end-user data that we obtain in conducting our business. Any such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business, and we could suffer losses, including the cost of product recalls and returns, and reputational harm. Furthermore, we have agreed to indemnify customers for certain IP rights claims against them. As a result of IP rights claims, we could:•pay monetary damages, including payments to satisfy indemnification obligations;•stop manufacturing, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products or technology subject to claims;    •develop other products or technology not subject to claims, which could be time-consuming or costly; and/or•enter into settlement and license agreements, which agreements may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.These IP rights claims could harm our competitive position, result in expenses, or require us to impair our assets. If we alter or stop production of affected items, our revenue could be harmed.We rely on access to third-party IP, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all.  Many of our products include third-party IP and/or implement industry standards, which may require licenses from third parties. Based on past experience and industry practice, we believe such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there is no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party IP, or to use such IP on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude us from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.24Table of ContentsWe are subject to the risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings. We may face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, competition, and other issues on a global basis. As described in ""Note 25: Contingencies"" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we are engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. In addition, regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations, and distracting to management.We must attract, retain, and motivate key employees. To be competitive, we must attract, retain, and motivate executives and other key employees. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff, and sales representatives are critical to our business, and competition for experienced employees can be intense. To help attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, we use share-based and other performance-based incentive awards such as restricted stock units (RSUs) and cash bonuses. If our share-based or other compensation programs cease to be viewed as competitive and valuable benefits, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. We are subject to cybersecurity and privacy risks.Third parties attempt to gain unauthorized access to our network, products, services, and infrastructure. We regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet or to introduce malicious software to our information technology (IT) systems. Additionally, malicious hackers may attempt to gain unauthorized access and corrupt the processes of hardware and software products that we manufacture and services we provide. Due to the widespread use of our products and the high profile of our commercial security products, we or our products and services are a frequent target of computer hackers and organizations that intend to sabotage, take control of, or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other processes, products, and services. We are also a target of malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our customers or end users; steal proprietary information related to our business, products, employees, and customers; or interrupt our systems and services or those of our customers or others. We believe such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication. From time to time, we encounter intrusions or unauthorized access to our network, products, services, or infrastructure. To date, none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business or operations. In some instances, we, our customers, and the users of our products and services might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. While we seek to detect and investigate all unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network, products, and services, and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes to our internal processes and tools and/or changes or patches to our products and services, we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats. Such incidents, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in our incurring significant costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems, reduced inventory value, providing modifications to our products and services, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties. In addition, these threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures. Publicity about vulnerabilities and attempted or successful incursions could damage our reputation with customers or users, and reduce demand for our products and services.We may be subject to theft, loss, or misuse of personal data about our employees, customers, or other third parties, which could increase our expenses, damage our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant. In addition, even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others.25Table of ContentsWe are subject to risks associated with transactions.We invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments. We make investments in public and private companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support key business initiatives. Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable at the time of our initial investment. Companies in which we invest range from early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction to mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. The success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on the availability to the company of additional funding on favorable terms, or a liquidity event, such as a public offering or acquisition. If any of the companies in which we invest fail, we could lose all or part of our investment. If we determine that an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value exists for an investment, we write down the investment to its fair value and recognize a loss.Our acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions could fail to achieve strategic objectives, disrupt our ongoing business, and harm our results of operations. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate opportunities, and enter into agreements for possible acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions, such as joint ventures. Given that our resources are limited, our decision to complete an acquisition has opportunity costs and we may need to forgo the prospect of acquiring other companies or technologies that could help us achieve our strategic objectives. In addition to opportunity costs, these transactions involve large challenges and risks, including risks that:•the transaction may not advance our business strategy;•we may be unable to identify opportunities on terms acceptable to us;•we may not realize a satisfactory return;•we may experience disruption of our ongoing operations;•we may be unable to retain key personnel;•we may experience difficulty in integrating new employees, business systems, and technology; •acquired businesses may not have adequate controls, processes, and procedures to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, and our due diligence process may not identify compliance issues or other liabilities;•we may have difficulty entering new market segments; •we may be unable to retain the customers and partners of acquired businesses; and/or•there may be unknown, underestimated, and/or undisclosed commitments or liabilities.When we decide to sell assets or a business, we may have difficulty selling on acceptable terms in a timely manner, and the agreed-upon terms and financing arrangements could be renegotiated due to changes in business or market conditions. These circumstances could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional expense, or we may sell a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated, resulting in a loss on the transaction.If we do enter into agreements with respect to acquisitions, divestitures, or other transactions, we may fail to complete them due to factors such as:•failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals;    •IP disputes or other litigation; or•difficulties obtaining financing for the transaction.We are subject to sales-related risks.We face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties. We sell a significant portion of our products through third parties such as distributors, value-added resellers, OEMs, ODMs, Internet service providers, and channel partners (collectively referred to as distributors). Using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks, including competitive pressure, concentration, credit risk, and compliance risks. Distributors may sell products that compete with our products, and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to focus distributors on the sale of our products. We may rely on one or more key distributors for a product, and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue. Distributors may face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business. Failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position.26Table of ContentsWe face risks related to business transactions with U.S. government entities. We receive proceeds from services and products we provide to the U.S. government. U.S. government demand and payment may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations. U.S. government contracts are subject to oversight, including special rules on accounting, IP rights, expenses, reviews, information handling, and security. Failure to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions, including termination of contracts, fines, and suspensions, or debarment from future U.S. government business.Our results of operations could vary as a result of the methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying accounting policies. The methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying accounting policies have a large impact on our results of operations. For more information, see ""Critical Accounting Estimates"" in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. These methods, estimates, and judgments are subject to large risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, and changes could affect our results of operations.Changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income. A number of factors may increase our effective tax rates, which could reduce our net income, including:    •the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;•the resolution of issues arising from tax audits;•changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances;•adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns;•increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill;•changes in available tax credits;•changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including changes in the U.S. to the taxation of manufacturing enterprises and of non-U.S. income and expenses;•changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and•our decision to repatriate non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes.We may have fluctuations in the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases. The amount, timing, and execution of our stock repurchase program may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes—such as investing in our business, including operational spending, capital spending, and acquisitions, and returning cash to our stockholders as dividend payments—and because of changes in cash flows and changes in tax laws. Workforce restructuring actions may be disruptive to our operations and adversely affect our financial results. In response to the business environment and to accomplish our strategic objectives, from time to time we may restructure our operations or make other adjustments to our workforce. Such workforce changes can result in restructuring charges in addition to those described in ""Note 13: Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges"" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Such workforce changes can also temporarily reduce workforce productivity, which could be disruptive to our business and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we may not achieve or sustain the expected cost savings or other benefits of our restructuring plans, or do so within the expected time frame.There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls. We do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that resource constraints exist, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. If our controls become inadequate, we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, our reputation may be adversely affected, our business and operating results could be harmed, and the market price of our stock could decline. 27Table of Contents"
11,INTC,INTEL CORP,2015-02-13,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSThe following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. You should also refer to the other information set forth in this Annual Report, including ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" and our financial statements and the related notes.Changes in product demand can harm our results of operation and financial condition.Demand for our products is variable and hard to predict. Changes in the demand for our products may reduce our revenue, increase our costs, lower our gross margin percentage, or require us to write down the value of our assets. Important factors that could lead to variation in the demand for our products include changes in:•business conditions, including downturns in the computing industry, or in the global or regional economies;•consumer confidence or income levels caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in government borrowing, taxation, or spending policies; the credit market; or expected inflation, employment, and energy or other commodity prices;•the level of our customers’ inventories;•competitive and pricing pressures, including actions taken by competitors;•customer product needs;•market acceptance of our products and maturing product cycles; and•the technology supply chain, including supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events.We face significant competition. The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market developments, changes in industry standards, changes in customer needs, and frequent product introductions and improvements. If we do not anticipate and respond to these developments, our competitive position may weaken, and our products or technologies might be uncompetitive or obsolete. Over recent years, our business focus has expanded and now includes the design and production of platforms for tablets, smartphones, and other devices across the compute continuum, including products for the Internet of Things, and related services. As a result, we face new sources of competition, including, in certain of these market segments, from incumbent competitors with established customer bases and greater brand recognition. To be successful, we need to cultivate new industry relationships with customers and partners in these market segments. In addition, we must continually improve the cost, integration, and energy efficiency of our products as well as expand our software capabilities to provide customers with comprehensive computing solutions. Despite our ongoing efforts, there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain consumer and market acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments.To compete successfully, we must maintain a successful R&D effort, develop new products and production processes, and improve our existing products and processes ahead of competitors. For example, we invest substantially in our network of manufacturing and assembly and test facilities, including the construction of new fabrication facilities to support smaller transistor geometries and larger wafers. Our R&D efforts are critical to our success and are aimed at solving complex problems, and we do not expect all of our projects to be successful. We may be unable to develop and market new products successfully, and the products we invest in and develop may not be well-received by customers. Our R&D investments may not generate significant operating income or contribute to our future operating results for several years, and such contributions may not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments. Additionally, the products and technologies offered by others may affect demand for, or pricing of, our products.If we are not able to compete effectively, our financial results will be adversely affected, including increased costs and reduced revenue and gross margin, and we may be required to accelerate the write-down of the value of certain assets. 18Table of ContentsChanges in the mix of products sold may harm our financial results.Prices differ widely among the platforms we offer in our various market segments due to differences in features offered or manufacturing costs. For example, product offerings range from lower-priced and entry-level platforms such as those based on Intel Quark or Intel Atom processors to higher-end platforms based on Intel Xeon and Intel Itanium processors. If there is a shift in demand from our higher-priced to lower-priced platforms in any of our market segments, our gross margin and revenue would decrease. In addition, when products are initially introduced, they tend to have higher costs because of initial development costs and lower production volumes relative to the previous product generation, which can impact gross margin.We operate globally and are subject to significant risks in many jurisdictions.Global or regional conditions may harm our financial results.We have manufacturing, assembly and test, R&D, sales, and other operations in many countries, and some of our business activities may be concentrated in one or more geographic areas. Moreover, sales outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 82% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 27, 2014. As a result, our operations and our financial results, including our ability to manufacture, assemble and test, design, develop, or sell products, may be adversely affected by a number of factors outside of our control, including:•global and local economic conditions;•geopolitical and security issues, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, crime, political instability, and terrorist activity;•natural disasters, public health issues, and other catastrophic events;•inefficient infrastructure and other disruptions, such as supply chain interruptions and large-scale outages or unreliable provision of services from utilities, transportation, data hosting, or telecommunications providers;•government restrictions on, or nationalization of our operations in any country, or restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings from a particular country;•differing employment practices and labor issues; •formal or informal imposition of new or revised export and/or import and doing-business regulations, which could be changed without notice;•ineffective legal protection of our IP rights in certain countries; and•local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices. We are subject to laws and regulations worldwide affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, employment, environment, health, and safety. Compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and expensive and such requirements may differ among jurisdictions.Although we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, and/or agents will not violate such laws or our policies. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation.We may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.We are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency exchange rates. Although most of our sales occur in U.S. dollars, expenses may be paid in local currencies. An increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the U.S. where we sell in dollars, and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of expenses such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, as well as overseas capital expenditures. We also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements; therefore, changes in exchange rates could harm our results of operations and financial condition.19Table of ContentsCatastrophic events or geopolitical conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.Our operations or systems could be disrupted by natural disasters; geopolitical conditions; terrorist activity; public health issues; cybersecurity incidents; interruptions of service from utilities, transportation or telecommunications providers; or other catastrophic events. Such events could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver products to our customers, receive production materials from our suppliers, or perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. While we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business, some of our systems are not fully redundant and we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disruptions. We maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks. We place our insurance coverage with multiple carriers in numerous jurisdictions. However, one or more of our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. The types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability, cost, and decisions with respect to risk retention. The policies have deductibles and exclusions that result in us retaining a level of self-insurance. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.We operate our own fabrication facilities and, as a result, are vulnerable to manufacturing-related risks. Due to the variability in demand for our products, we may be unable to timely respond to reduce costs when demand declines or to increase production when demand increases.Our operations have high costs that are either fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term, including our costs related to manufacturing, such as facility construction and equipment, R&D, and the employment and training of a highly skilled workforce. If product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges, which would lower our gross margin. Our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. Factory-planning decisions may shorten the useful lives of facilities and equipment and cause us to accelerate depreciation.Conversely, if product demand increases, we may be unable to add capacity fast enough to meet market demand. Our revenue and gross margin can also be affected by the timing of our product introductions and related expenses, including marketing expenses.We are subject to risks associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing process technology.We may not be successful or efficient in developing or implementing new production processes. Production of integrated circuits is a complex process. We are continually engaged in the transition from our existing process to the next-generation process technology. This consistent innovation involves significant expense and carries inherent risks, including difficulties in designing and developing next-generation process technologies, development and production timing delays, lower than anticipated manufacturing yields, and product defects and errata. Disruptions in the production process can also result from errors, defects in materials, interruption in our supply of materials or resources, and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents, maintenance issues, or unsafe working conditions—all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields. Production issues can lead to increased costs and may affect our ability to meet product demand, which could adversely impact our business and the results from operations.We face supply chain risks.We have thousands of suppliers providing materials that we use in production and other aspects of our business. Where possible, we seek to have several sources of supply for all of those materials. However, for certain materials, we may rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single location. In addition, consolidation among suppliers could impact the nature, quality, availability, and pricing of the products and services available to us. The inability of suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt our production processes or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy. Production could be disrupted by the unavailability of resources used in production, such as water, silicon, electricity, gases, and other materials. The unavailability or reduced availability of materials or resources may require us to reduce production or incur additional costs, which could harm our business and results of operations.20Table of ContentsWe also rely on third-party providers to manufacture, assemble and test certain components or products, particularly for our networking, mobile and communications, and NAND flash memory businesses. If any of these third parties are unable to perform these services on a timely basis, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions that could adversely affect our financial results.In addition, there are regulatory and other requirements, restrictions, and requests from various constituencies regarding sourcing practices and supplier conduct, with a trend toward expanding the scope of materials and locations where materials originate, regulating supplier behaviors, and increasing the required disclosures regarding such matters by public companies. Increased regulation and public pressure in this area would cause our compliance costs to increase and could negatively affect our reputation given that we use many materials in the manufacturing of our products and rely on many suppliers to provide these materials, but do not directly control their procurement or employment practices.We are subject to the risks of product defects and errata.Product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications) may result from problems in our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test processes. Costs from defects and errata could include:•writing off some or all of the value of inventory;•recalling products that have been shipped;•providing product replacements or modifications; and•defending against resulting litigation.These costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin, and result in delay or loss of revenue. Our reputation with customers or end users could be damaged as a result of product defects and errata, and product demand could be reduced. The announcement of product defects and errata could cause customers to purchase products from competitors as a result of possible shortages of our components or for other reasons. Any of these occurrences could harm our business and financial results.We are subject to risks associated with environmental laws and regulations.The manufacturing and assembly and test of our products require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of EHS laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in:•regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities;•suspension of production;•alteration of our fabrication and assembly and test processes;•reputational challenges; and•restrictions on our operations or sales.Our failure to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, or disposal of hazardous materials could lead to increased costs or future liabilities. Our ability to grow or modify our manufacturing capability in the future may be impeded by environmental regulations, such as air quality and wastewater requirements. Environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product designs, or incur other expenses. Many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may be subject to regulation under environmental laws and regulations. These restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processes.Climate change may also pose regulatory and environmental risks that could harm our results of operations and affect the way we conduct business. For example, climate change regulation could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution control requirements, and increased or new monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. We also see the potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations if, for example, utility companies pass on their costs to their customers. Furthermore, many of our operations are located in semi-arid regions that may become increasingly vulnerable to prolonged droughts due to climate change. Our fabrication facilities have significant water use and, while we recycle and reuse a portion of the water used, we may have difficulties obtaining sufficient water to fulfill our operational needs due the lack of available infrastructure. 21Table of ContentsWe are subject to IP risks and risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings.We may be unable to enforce or protect our IP rights.We regard our patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and other IP rights as important to the success of our business. We rely on IP law as well as confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers, employees, technology development partners, and others to protect our IP rights. Our ability to enforce these rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our IP rights in various countries. When we seek to enforce our rights, we may be subject to claims that the IP rights are invalid, not enforceable, or licensed to the opposing party. Our assertion of IP rights may result in the other party seeking to assert claims against us, which could harm our business. Governments may adopt regulations—and governments or courts may render decisions—requiring compulsory licensing of IP rights, or governments may require products to meet standards that serve to favor local companies. Our inability to enforce our IP rights under any of these circumstances may harm our competitive position and business. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in R&D, product development, and marketing could be reduced. Our licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives may allow competitors to use our patent rights.Companies in our industry often bilaterally license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements. Our competitors may have licenses to our patents, and under current case law, some of the licenses may exhaust our patent rights as to licensed product sales under some circumstances. Our participation in industry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives may require us to license our patents to companies that adopt industry-standard specifications. Depending on the rules of the organization, we might have to grant these licenses to our patents for little or no cost, and as a result, we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others, our costs of enforcing our licenses or protecting our patents may increase, and the value of our IP rights may be impaired. Third parties may assert claims based on IP rights against us or our products, which could harm our business.We may face claims based on IP rights from individuals and companies, including those who have acquired patent portfolios to assert claims against other companies. We are normally engaged in a number of litigation matters involving IP rights. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, whether or not meritorious, could cause us to incur large costs to respond to, defend, and resolve the claims, and they may divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel. In addition, we may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets and other confidential business information or end-user data that we obtain in conducting our business. Any such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business, and we could suffer losses, including the cost of product recalls and returns, and reputational harm. Furthermore, we have agreed to indemnify customers for certain IP rights claims against them. As a result of IP rights claims, we could:•pay monetary damages, including payments to satisfy indemnification obligations;•stop manufacturing, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products or technology subject to claims;    •develop other products or technology not subject to claims, which could be time-consuming or costly; and/or•enter into settlement and license agreements, which agreements may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.These IP rights claims could harm our competitive position, result in expenses, or require us to impair our assets. If we alter or stop production of affected items, our revenue could be harmed.We rely on access to third-party IP, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all.Many of our products include third-party IP and/or implement industry standards, which may require licenses from third parties. Based on past experience and industry practice, we believe such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there is no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party IP, or to use such IP on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude us from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.22Table of ContentsWe are subject to the risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings.We may face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, competition, and other issues on a global basis. As described in ""Note 25: Contingencies"" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we are engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. In addition, regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations, and distracting to management. We must attract, retain, and motivate key employees. To be competitive, we must attract, retain, and motivate executives and other key employees. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff, and sales representatives are critical to our business, and competition for experienced employees can be intense. To help attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, we use share-based and other performance-based incentive awards such as restricted stock units and cash bonuses. If our share-based or other compensation programs cease to be viewed as competitive and valuable benefits, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. We are subject to cybersecurity and privacy risks.Third parties might attempt to gain unauthorized access to our network or seek to compromise our products and services.We regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet or to introduce malicious software to our information technology (IT) systems. Additionally, malicious hackers may attempt to gain unauthorized access and corrupt the processes of hardware and software products that we manufacture and services we provide. Due to the widespread use of our products and due to the high profile of our McAfee subsidiary, we or our products and services are a frequent target of computer hackers and organizations that intend to sabotage, take control of, or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other processes, products, and services. We are also a target of malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our customers or end users; steal proprietary information related to our business, products, employees, and customers; or interrupt our systems and services or those of our customers or others. We believe such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication. From time to time we encounter intrusions or attempts at gaining unauthorized access to our products, services, and network. To date, none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business or operations. In some instances, we, our customers, and the users of our products and services might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. While we seek to detect and investigate all unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network, products, and services, and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes to our internal processes and tools and/or changes or patches to our products and services, we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats. Such incidents, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in our incurring significant costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems, reduced inventory value, providing modifications to our products and services, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties. In addition, these threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures. Publicity about vulnerabilities and attempted or successful incursions could damage our reputation with customers or users, and reduce demand for our products and services. We may be subject to theft, loss, or misuse of personal data about our employees, customers, or other third parties, which could increase our expenses, damage our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings.The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex compliance regulatory environment. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant. In addition, our even inadvertent failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others.23Table of ContentsWe are subject to risks associated with strategic transactions.We invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments.We make investments in public and private companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support key business initiatives. Many of the securities in which we invest are non-marketable at the time of our initial investment. Companies in which we invest range from early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction to mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. The success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on the availability to the company of additional funding on favorable terms, or a liquidity event, such as a public offering or acquisition. If any of the companies in which we invest fail, we could lose all or part of our investment. If we determine that an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value exists for an investment, we write down the investment to its fair value and recognize a loss.Our acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions could fail to achieve strategic objectives, disrupt our ongoing business and harm our results of operations. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate opportunities, and enter into agreements for possible acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions, such as joint ventures. Given that our resources are limited, our decision to complete an acquisition has opportunity costs and we may need to forego the prospect of acquiring other companies or technologies that could help us achieve our strategic objectives. In addition to opportunity costs, these transactions involve large challenges and risks, including risks that:•the transaction may not advance our business strategy;•we may be unable to identify opportunities on terms acceptable to us;•we may not realize a satisfactory return;•we may experience disruption of our ongoing operations;•we may be unable to retain key personnel;•we may experience difficulty in integrating new employees, business systems, and technology; •acquired businesses may not have adequate controls, processes, and procedures to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, and our due diligence process may not identify compliance issues or other liabilities;•we may have difficulty entering new market segments; •we may be unable to retain the customers and partners of acquired businesses; and/or•there may be unknown, underestimated, and/or undisclosed commitments or liabilities.When we decide to sell assets or a business, we may have difficulty selling on acceptable terms in a timely manner, and the agreed-upon terms and financing arrangements could be renegotiated due to changes in business or market conditions. These circumstances could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional expense, or we may sell a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated, resulting in a loss on the transaction.If we do enter into agreements with respect to acquisitions, divestitures, or other transactions, we may fail to complete them due to factors such as:•failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals;    •IP disputes or other litigation; or•difficulties obtaining financing for the transaction.We are subject to sales-related risks.We face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties.We sell a significant portion of our products through third parties such as distributors, value-added resellers, OEMs, Internet service providers, and channel partners (collectively referred to as distributors). Using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks, including competitive pressure, concentration, credit risk, and compliance risks. Distributors may sell products that compete with our products, and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to focus distributors on the sale of our products. We may rely on one or more key distributors for a product, and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue. Distributors may face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) or similar laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business. Failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position.24Table of ContentsWe face risks related to business transactions with U.S. government entities.We receive proceeds from services and products we provide to the U.S. government. U.S. government demand and payment may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations. U.S. government contracts are subject to oversight, including special rules on accounting, IP rights, expenses, reviews, information handling, and security. Failure to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions, including termination of contracts, fines, and suspensions, or debarment from future U.S. government business.Our results of operations could vary as a result of the methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying accounting policies. The methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying accounting policies have a large impact on our results of operations. For more information, see ""Critical Accounting Estimates"" in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. These methods, estimates, and judgments are subject to large risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, and changes could affect our results of operations.Changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income. A number of factors may increase our effective tax rates, which could reduce our net income, including:    •the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;•the resolution of issues arising from tax audits;•changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances;•adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns;•increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill;•changes in available tax credits;•changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including changes in the U.S. to the taxation of manufacturing enterprises and of non-U.S. income and expenses;•changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and•our decision to repatriate non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes.We may have fluctuations in the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases. The amount, timing, and other execution of our stock repurchase program may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes, such as investing in our business, including operational spending, capital spending, and acquisitions, and returning cash to our stockholders as dividend payments, and because of changes in cash flows and changes in tax laws. Workforce restructuring actions may be disruptive to our operations and adversely affect our financial results. In response to the business environment and to accomplish our strategic objectives, from time to time we may restructure our operations or make other adjustments to our workforce. Such workforce changes can result in restructuring charges in addition to those described in ""Note 13: Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges"" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Such workforce changes can also temporarily reduce workforce productivity, which could be disruptive to our business and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we may not achieve or sustain the expected cost savings or other benefits of our restructuring plans, or do so within the expected time frame.There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls. We do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that resource constraints exist, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. If our controls become inadequate, we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, our reputation may be adversely affected, our business and operating results could be harmed, and the market price of our stock could decline. 25Table of Contents"
1,INTC,INTEL CORP,2014-02-14,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSChanges in product demand may harm our financial results and are hard to predict.If product demand decreases, our revenue and profit could be harmed. Important factors that could cause demand for our products to decrease include changes in:•business conditions, including downturns in the computing industry, regional economies, and the overall economy;•consumer confidence or income levels caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in government borrowing, taxation, or spending policies; the credit market; or expected inflation, employment, and energy or other commodity prices;•the level of customers’ inventories;•competitive and pricing pressures, including actions taken by competitors;•customer product needs;•market acceptance of our products and maturing product cycles; and•the technology supply chain, including supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events.Our operations have high costs—including costs related to facility construction and equipment, R&D, and employment and training of a highly skilled workforce—that are either fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term. At the same time, demand for our products is highly variable and, in recent years, we have experienced declining orders in the traditional PC market segment, which has been negatively impacted by the growth in ultra-mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones. If product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges, which would lower our gross margin. Our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. Factory-planning decisions may shorten the useful lives of facilities and equipment and cause us to accelerate depreciation. If product demand increases, we may be unable to add capacity fast enough to meet market demand. Our revenue and gross margin percentage can also be affected by the timing of our product introductions and related expenses, including marketing expenses. Changes in product demand, and changes in our customers’ product needs, could negatively affect our competitive position and may reduce our revenue, increase our costs, lower our gross margin percentage, or require us to write down our assets.We operate in highly competitive industries, and our failure to anticipate and respond to technological and market developments could harm our ability to compete.We operate in highly competitive industries that experience rapid technological and market developments, changes in industry standards, changes in customer needs, and frequent product introductions and improvements. If we are unable to anticipate and respond to these developments, we might weaken our competitive position, and our products or technologies might be uncompetitive or obsolete. As computing market segments emerge, such as smartphones, tablets, and consumer electronics devices, we face new sources of competition and customers with needs different from those of customers in the PC market segment. Some of our competitors are pursuing a vertical integration strategy, incorporating their SoC solutions into the smartphones and tablets they offer, which could make it less likely that they will adopt our SoC solutions. To be successful, we need to cultivate new industry relationships in these market segments. As the number and variety of Internet-connected devices increase, we need to continuously improve the cost, connectivity, integration, features, energy efficiency, and security of our platforms, among other things, to succeed in these market segments. In addition, we need to expand our software capabilities to provide customers with comprehensive computing solutions. To compete successfully, we must maintain a successful R&D effort, develop new products and production processes, and improve our existing products and processes ahead of competitors. For example, we invest substantially in our network of manufacturing, assembly and test facilities, including the construction of new fabrication facilities to support smaller transistor geometries and larger wafers. Our R&D efforts are critical to our success and are aimed at solving complex problems, and we do not expect all of our projects to be successful. We may be unable to develop and market new products successfully, and the products we invest in and develop may not be well received by customers. Our R&D investments may not generate significant operating income or contribute to our future operating results for several years and such contributions may not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments. Additionally, the products and technologies offered by others may affect demand for or pricing of our products. These types of events could negatively affect our competitive position and may reduce revenue, increase costs, lower gross margin percentage, or require us to impair our assets. 17Table of ContentsChanges in the mix of products sold may harm our financial results.Because of the wide price differences of platform average selling prices among our data center, PC client, and Other IA platforms, a change in the mix of platforms among these market segments may impact our revenue and gross margin. For example, our PC client platforms that are incorporated in notebook and desktop computers tend to have lower average selling prices and gross margin than our data center platforms that are incorporated in servers, workstations and storage products. Therefore, if there is less demand for our data center platforms, and a resulting mix shift to our PC client platforms, our gross margins and revenue would decrease. Also, more recently introduced products tend to have higher costs because of initial development costs and lower production volumes relative to the previous product generation, which can impact gross margin.Our global operations subject us to risks that may harm our results of operations and financial condition.We have sales offices, R&D, manufacturing, assembly and test facilities, and other facilities in many countries, and some business activities may be concentrated in one or more geographic areas. As a result, our ability to manufacture, assemble and test, design, develop, or sell products may be affected by:•security concerns, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, crime, political instability, and terrorist activity;•natural disasters and health concerns;•inefficient and limited infrastructure and disruptions, such as supply chain interruptions and large-scale outages or interruptions of service from utilities, transportation, or telecommunications providers;•restrictions on our operations by governments seeking to support local industries, nationalization of our operations, and restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings;•differing employment practices and labor issues; and•local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations.Legal and regulatory requirements differ among jurisdictions worldwide. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. Although we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors, or agents may violate our policies.Although most of our sales occur in U.S. dollars, expenses such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses may be paid in local currencies. We also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements; therefore, changes in exchange rates could harm our results of operations and financial condition. Changes in tariff and import regulations and in U.S. and non-U.S. monetary policies may harm our results of operations and financial condition by increasing our expenses and reducing revenue. Differing tax rates in various jurisdictions could harm our results of operations and financial condition by increasing our overall tax rate.We maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks. We place our insurance coverage with multiple carriers in numerous jurisdictions. However, one or more of our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. The types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability, cost, and decisions with respect to risk retention. The policies have deductibles and exclusions that result in us retaining a level of self-insurance. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.Failure to meet our production targets, resulting in undersupply or oversupply of products, may harm our business and results of operations.Production of integrated circuits is a complex process. Disruptions in this process can result from errors, difficulties in our development and implementation of new processes, defects in materials, disruptions in our supply of materials or resources, and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents, maintenance issues, or unsafe working conditions—all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields. We may not be successful or efficient in developing or implementing new production processes. Production issues may result in our failure to meet or increase production as desired, resulting in higher costs or large decreases in yields, which could affect our ability to produce sufficient volume to meet product demand. The unavailability or reduced availability of products could make it more difficult to deliver computing platforms. The occurrence of these events could harm our business and results of operations.18Table of ContentsWe may have difficulties obtaining the resources or products we need for manufacturing, assembling and testing our products, or operating other aspects of our business, which could harm our ability to meet demand and increase our costs.We have thousands of suppliers providing materials that we use in production and other aspects of our business, and where possible, we seek to have several sources of supply for all of those materials. However, we may rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single location, for these materials. The inability of suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt our production processes or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy. Production could be disrupted by the unavailability of resources used in production, such as water, silicon, electricity, gases, and other materials. Future environmental regulations could restrict the supply or increase the cost of materials that we use in our business and make it more difficult to obtain permits to build or modify manufacturing capacity to meet demand. The unavailability or reduced availability of materials or resources may require us to reduce production or incur additional costs. The occurrence of these events could harm our business and results of operations.Costs related to product defects and errata may harm our results of operations and business.Costs of product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications) due to, for example, problems in our design and manufacturing processes, could include:•writing off the value of inventory;•disposing of products that cannot be fixed;•recalling products that have been shipped;•providing product replacements or modifications; and•defending against litigation.These costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin. Our reputation with customers or end users could be damaged as a result of product defects and errata, and product demand could be reduced. The announcement of product defects and errata could cause customers to purchase products from competitors as a result of possible shortages of Intel components or for other reasons. These factors could harm our business and financial results.Third parties might attempt to gain unauthorized access to our network or seek to compromise our products and services, which could damage our reputation and financial results.We regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet or to introduce malicious software to our IT systems. Additionally, malicious hackers may attempt to gain unauthorized access and corrupt the processes of hardware and software products that we manufacture and services we provide. These attempts might be the result of industrial or other espionage or actions by hackers seeking to harm our company, our products and services, or users of our products and services. Due to the widespread use of our products and due to the high profile of our McAfee subsidiary, we or our products and services are a frequent target of computer hackers and organizations that intend to sabotage, take control of, or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other processes, products and services. We are also a target of malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our customers or end users; steal proprietary information related to our business, products, employees and customers; or interrupt our systems and services or those of our customers or others. We believe such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication. These attacks are sometimes successful; and in some instances, we, our customers, and the users of our products and services might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. We seek to detect and investigate such attempts and incidents and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes to our internal processes and tools and/or changes or patches to our products and services, but in some cases preventive and remedial action might not be successful. Such attacks, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in our incurring costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems, reduced inventory value, providing modifications to our products and services, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties. Publicity about vulnerabilities and attempted or successful incursions could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce demand for our products and services.19Table of ContentsWe may be subject to theft, loss or misuse of personal data about us or our employees, customers or other third parties, which could increase our expenses, damage our reputation or result in litigation.Global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity are rapidly expanding and creating a complex compliance environment. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business could result in increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Costs to comply with and implement privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant. Our failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others.Third parties may claim infringement of IP rights, which could harm our business.We may face IP rights infringement claims from individuals and companies, including those who have acquired patent portfolios to assert claims against other companies. We are engaged in a number of litigation matters involving IP rights. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others could cause us to incur large costs to respond to, defend, and resolve the claims, and they may divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel. As a result of IP rights infringement claims, we could:•pay monetary damages for infringement claims;•stop manufacturing, using, selling, offering to sell or importing products or technology subject to infringement claims;•develop other products or technology not subject to infringement claims, which could be time-consuming, costly or impossible; or•license technology from the party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.These actions could harm our competitive position, result in expenses, or require us to impair our assets. If we alter or stop production of affected items, our revenue could be harmed.We may be unable to enforce or protect our IP rights, which may harm our ability to compete and may harm our business.Our ability to enforce our patents, copyrights, software licenses, and other IP rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our IP rights in various countries. When we seek to enforce our rights, we are often subject to claims that the IP rights are invalid, not enforceable, or licensed to the opposing party. Our assertion of IP rights often results in the other party seeking to assert claims against us, which could harm our business. Governments may adopt regulations—and governments or courts may render decisions—requiring compulsory licensing of IP rights, or governments may require products to meet standards that serve to favor local companies. Our inability to enforce our IP rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and business.We may be subject to IP theft or misuse, which could result in claims against us and harm our business and results of operations.The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; the value of our investment in R&D, product development, and marketing could be reduced. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of third party trade secrets and other confidential business information that we obtain in conducting our business might lead to third-party claims against us related to the loss of the confidential or proprietary information or end-user data. Any such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business, and we could suffer losses, including the cost of product recalls and returns and reputational harm.Our licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives may allow competitors to use our patent rights.Companies in the computing industry often bilaterally license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements between them. Our competitors may have licenses to our patents, and under current case law, some of the licenses may permit these competitors to pass our patent rights on to others under some circumstances. Our participation in industry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives may require us to license our patents to companies that adopt industry-standard specifications. Depending on the rules of the organization, we might have to grant these licenses to our patents for little or no cost, and as a result, we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others, our costs of enforcing our licenses or protecting our patents may increase, and the value of our IP rights may be impaired. In addition, we may not be able to obtain licenses on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms to patents asserted to be essential to standards that we implement in our products.20Table of ContentsLitigation or regulatory proceedings could harm our business.We may face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, competition, and other issues on a global basis. As described in “Note 26: Contingencies” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we are engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling products, engaging in business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents.We face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties.We sell a portion of our products through third parties such as distributors, value-added resellers, OEMs, Internet service providers, and channel partners (collectively referred to as distributors). Using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks, including competitive pressure, concentration, credit risk, and compliance risks. Distributors may sell products that compete with our products, and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to focus distributors on the sale of our products. We may rely on one or more key distributors for a product, and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue. Distributors may face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. Violations of FCPA or similar laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business. Failing to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position.We face risks related to sales to government entities.We derive a portion of our revenue from sales to government entities and their respective agencies. Government demand and payment for our products may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations. Government contracts are subject to oversight, including special rules on accounting, expenses, reviews, and security. Failing to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions, including termination of contracts, fines and suspensions, or debarment from future government business.We invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments.We make investments in companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support key business initiatives. These investments include equity or debt instruments of public or private companies, and many of these instruments are non-marketable at the time of our initial investment. Companies range from early-stage companies that are still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. The companies in which we invest may fail because they are unable to secure additional funding, obtain favorable terms for future financings, or participate in liquidity events such as public offerings, mergers, and private sales. If any of these companies fail, we could lose all or part of our investment. If we determine that an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value exists for an investment, we write down the investment to its fair value and recognize a loss, impacting gains (losses) on equity investments, net. Our results of operations could vary as a result of the methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying accounting policies.The methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying accounting policies have a large impact on our results of operations. For more information, see “Critical Accounting Estimates” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. These methods, estimates, and judgments are subject to large risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, and changes could affect our results of operations.Changes in our effective tax rate may harm our results of operations.A number of factors may increase our effective tax rates, which could reduce our net income, including:•the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;•the resolution of issues arising from tax audits;•changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances;•adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns;•increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired in-process research and development and impairments of goodwill;•changes in available tax credits;•changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including changes in the U.S. to the taxation of non-U.S income and expenses;•changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and•our decision to repatriate non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes.21Table of ContentsDecisions about the scope of operations of our business could affect our results of operations and financial condition.Changes in the business environment could lead to changes in the scope of our operations, resulting in restructuring and asset impairment charges in addition to those announced in the last twelve months. Factors that could affect our results of operations and financial condition due to a change in the scope of our operations include:•timing and execution of plans and programs subject to local labor law requirements, including consultation with work councils;•changes in assumptions related to severance and postretirement costs;•divestitures;•new business initiatives and changes in product roadmap, development, and manufacturing;•changes in employment levels and turnover rates;•changes in product demand and the business environment; and•changes in the fair value of long-lived assets.Our acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions could disrupt our ongoing business and harm our results of operations.In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate opportunities, and enter into agreements for possible investments, acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions, such as joint ventures. Acquisitions and other transactions involve large challenges and risks, including risks that:•we may be unable to identify opportunities on terms acceptable to us;•the transaction may not advance our business strategy;•we may not realize a satisfactory return;•we may be unable to retain key personnel;•we may experience difficulty in integrating new employees, business systems, and technology;•acquired businesses may not have adequate controls, processes, and procedures to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, and our due diligence process may not identify compliance issues or other liabilities;•we may have difficulty entering new market segments; or•we may be unable to retain the customers and partners of acquired businesses.When we decide to sell assets or a business, we may have difficulty selling on acceptable terms in a timely manner, and the agreed-upon terms and financing arrangements could be renegotiated due to changes in business or market conditions. These circumstances could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur added expense, or we may sell a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated, resulting in a loss on the transaction.If we do enter into agreements with respect to acquisitions, divestitures, or other transactions, we may fail to complete them due to factors such as:•failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals;•IP disputes or other litigation; or•difficulties obtaining financing for the transaction.Our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could harm our business and results of operations.The manufacturing and assembly and test of our products require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of EHS laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in:•regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities;•suspension of production;•alteration of our fabrication and assembly and test processes; •reputational challenges; and•restrictions on our operations or sales.Our failure to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, or disposal of hazardous materials could lead to increased costs or future liabilities. Environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product designs, or incur other expenses. Many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may be subject to regulation under environmental laws and regulations. These restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processes.22Table of ContentsIn addition, the SEC has adopted disclosure rules for companies that use conflict minerals (commonly referred to as tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold) in their products, with substantial supply chain verification requirements in the event that the materials come from the DRC or adjoining countries. The European Union and other foreign jurisdictions may in the future also enact rules regarding conflict minerals, which could potentially cover additional minerals or locations where minerals originate. Due to the complexity of our supply chain, we may face reputational challenges with our customers, stockholders and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the conflict minerals used in our products.Climate change poses both regulatory and physical risks that could harm our results of operations and affect the way we conduct business.In addition to the possible direct economic impact that climate change could have on us, climate change mitigation programs and regulations can increase our costs. The cost of perfluorocompounds (PFCs)—a gas that we use in manufacturing—could increase under some climate-change-focused emissions trading programs that may be imposed through regulation. If the use of PFCs is prohibited, we would need to obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations. Air-quality permit requirements for our manufacturing operations could become more burdensome and cause delays in our ability to modify or build additional manufacturing capacity. Under recently adopted greenhouse gas regulations in the U.S., many of our manufacturing facilities have become “major” sources under the Clean Air Act. At a minimum, this change in status results in some uncertainty as the EPA adopts guidance on its greenhouse gas regulations. Due to the dynamic nature of our operations, these regulations will likely result in increased costs for our U.S. operations. These cost increases could be associated with new air pollution control requirements, and increased or new monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. We also see the potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations. Our costs could increase if utility companies pass on their costs, such as those associated with carbon taxes, emission cap and trade programs, or renewable portfolio standards. While we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business, we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disasters or events. Many of our operations are located in semi-arid regions, such as Israel and the southwestern U.S. Some scenarios predict that these regions may become even more vulnerable to prolonged droughts due to climate change.In order to compete, we must attract, retain, and motivate key employees, and our failure to do so could harm our results of operations.In order to compete, we must attract, retain, and motivate executives and other key employees. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff, and sales representatives are critical to our business, and competition for experienced employees in the semiconductor industry can be intense. To help attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, we use share-based incentive awards such as employee stock options and non-vested share units (restricted stock units). If the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock, or if our share-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations.A number of factors could lower interest and other, net harming our results of operations.Factors that could lower interest and other, net in our consolidated statements of income include changes in fixed-income, equity, and credit markets; foreign currency exchange rates; interest rates; credit standing of financial instrument counterparties; our cash and investment balances; and our indebtedness.There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls. We do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.23Table of Contents"

Important factors that couldcause demand for our products to fluctuate include:     changes in customer product needs;     changes in the level of customers inventory;     changes in business and economic conditions, including a    downturn in the semiconductor industry;     competitive pressures from companies that have competing    products, chip architectures and manufacturing technologies;     strategic actions taken by our competitors; and     market acceptance of our products.If demand for our products is reduced, our manufacturing and/orassembly and test capacity could be under-utilized, and we maybe required to record an impairment on our long-lived assetsincluding facilities and equipment, as well as intangibleassets, which would increase our expenses. In addition, factoryplanning decisions may cause us to record accelerateddepreciation. In the long term, if demand for our productsincreases, we may not be able to add manufacturing and/orassembly and test capacity fast enough to meet market demand.These changes in demand for our products, and changes in ourcustomers product needs, could have a variety of negativeeffects on our competitive position and our financial results,and, in certain cases, may reduce our revenue, increase ourcosts, lower our gross margin percentage, or require us torecognize and record impairments of our assets.The semiconductor industry and our operations arecharacterized by a high percentage of costs that are fixed orotherwise difficult to reduce in the short term, and by productdemand that is highly variable and is subject to significantdownturns that may adversely affect our business, results ofoperations and financial condition.The semiconductor industry and our operations are characterizedby high costs, such as those related to facility constructionand equipment, research and development, and employment andtraining of a highly skilled workforce, that are either fixed ordifficult to reduce in the short term. At the same time, demandfor our products is highly variable and has experienceddownturns, often in connection with maturing product cycles anddownturns in general economic market conditions. These downturnshave been characterized by reduced product demand, manufacturingovercapacity, high inventory levels and decreased averageselling prices. The combination of these factors may cause ourrevenue, gross margin, cash flow and profitability to varysignificantly both in the short term and over the long term.We operate in intensely competitive industries, and ourfailure to respond quickly to technological developments andincorporate new features into our products could have an adverseeffect on our ability to compete.We operate in intensely competitive industries that experiencerapid technological developments, changes in industry standards,changes in customer requirements, and frequent new productintroductions and improvements. If we are unable to respondquickly and successfully to these developments, we may lose ourcompetitive position, and our products or technologies maybecome uncompetitive or obsolete. To compete successfully, wemust maintain a successful R&D effort, develop new productsand production processes, and improve our existing products andprocesses at the same pace or ahead of our competitors. We maynot be able to successfully develop and market these newproducts; the products we invest in and develop may not be wellreceived by customers; and products developed and newtechnologies offered by others may affect the demand for ourproducts. These types of events could have a variety of negativeeffects on our competitive position and our financial results,such as reducing our revenue, increasing our costs, lowering ourgross margin percentage, and requiring us to recognize andrecord impairments of our assets.18Table of ContentsFluctuations in the mix of products sold may adverselyaffect our financial results.Because of the wide price differences among mobile, desktop andserver microprocessors, the mix and types of performancecapabilities of microprocessors sold affect the average sellingprice of our products and have a substantial impact on ourrevenue. Our financial results also depend in part on the mix ofother products we sell, such as chipsets, flash memory and othersemiconductor products. In addition, more recently introducedproducts tend to have higher associated costs because of initialoverall development costs and higherstart-up costs.Fluctuations in the mix and types of our products may alsoaffect the extent to which we are able to recover our fixedcosts and investments that are associated with a particularproduct, and as a result can negatively impact our financialresults.Our global operations subject us to risks that maynegatively affect our results of operations and financialcondition.We have sales offices and research and development,manufacturing, and assembly and test facilities in manycountries, and as a result, we are subject to risks associatedwith doing business globally. Our global operations may besubject to risks that may limit our ability to manufacture,assemble and test, design, develop or sell products inparticular countries, which could in turn have an adverse effecton our results of operations and financial condition, including:     health concerns;     natural disasters;     inefficient and limited infrastructure and disruptions, such as    large-scale outages or interruptions of service from utilities    or telecommunications providers and supply chain interruptions;     differing employment practices and labor issues;     local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal    standards and practices;     regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ between    jurisdictions;     security concerns, including crime, political instability,    terrorist activity, armed conflict and civil or military    unrest; and     restrictions on our operations by governments seeking to support    local industries, nationalization of our operations and    restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings.In addition, although most of our products are priced and paidfor in U.S. dollars, a significant amount of certain typesof expenses, such as payroll, utilities, tax and marketingexpenses, are paid in local currencies. Fluctuations in the rateof exchange between the U.S. dollar and the currencies ofother countries in which we conduct business, and changes incurrency controls with respect to such countries, couldnegatively impact our business, operating results and financialcondition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses insuch countries. In addition, changes in tariff and importregulations and to U.S. andnon-U.S. monetarypolicies may also negatively impact our revenue in thoseaffected countries. Varying tax rates in different jurisdictionscould negatively impact our overall tax rate.Failure to meet our production targets, resulting inundersupply or oversupply of products, may adversely impact ourbusiness and results of operations.Manufacturing and assembly and test of integrated circuits is acomplex process. Disruptions in this process can result fromdifficulties in our development and implementation of newprocesses, errors and interruptions in the processes, defects inmaterials and disruptions in our supply of materials orresources, all of which could affect the timing of productionramps and yields. Furthermore, we may not be successful orefficient in developing or implementing new productionprocesses. The occurrence of any of the foregoing may result inour failure to increase production as desired, resulting inhigher costs or substantial decreases in yields, which couldimpact our ability to produce sufficient volume to meet specificproduct demand. Furthermore, the unavailability or reducedavailability of certain products could make it more difficult toimplement our platform strategy. We may also experienceincreases in yields. A substantial increase in yields couldresult in higher inventory levels and the possibility ofresulting excess capacity charges as we slow production toreduce inventory levels. In addition, higher yields, as well asother factors, can decrease overall unit costs and may cause usto revalue our existing inventory on certain products to theirlower replacement cost, which would impact our gross margin inthe quarters in which this revaluation occurs. The occurrence ofany of these events could adversely impact our business andresults of operations.We may have difficulties obtaining the resources orproducts we need for manufacturing or assembling our products oroperating other aspects of our business, which could adverselyaffect our ability to meet demand for our products and mayincrease our costs.We have thousands of suppliers providing various materials thatwe use in production of our products and other aspects of ourbusiness, and we seek, where possible, to have several sourcesof supply for all of these materials. However, we may rely on asingle or a limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in asingle country, for these materials. The inability of suchsuppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materialsor other supplies could disrupt our production process or couldmake it more difficult for us to implement our platformstrategy. In addition, production could be disrupted by theunavailability of the resources used in production such aswater, silicon, electricity and gases. The unavailability orreduced availability of the materials or resources we use in ourbusiness may require us to reduce production of products or mayrequire us to incur additional costs in order to obtain anadequate supply of these materials or resources. The occurrenceof any of these events could adversely impact our business andresults of operations.19Table of ContentsCosts related to product defects and errata may have anadverse impact on our results of operations and business.Costs associated with unexpected product defects and errata(deviations from published specifications) include, for example,the costs of:     writing down the value of inventory of defective products;     disposing of defective products that cannot be fixed;     recalling defective products that have been shipped to customers;     providing product replacements for or modifications to defective    products; and     defending against litigation related to defective products.These costs could be substantial and may therefore increase ourexpenses and adversely affect our gross margin. In addition, ourreputation with our customers or end users of our products couldbe damaged as a result of such product defects and errata, andthe demand for our products could be reduced. These factorscould negatively impact our financial results and the prospectsfor our business.We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-partyintellectual property rights, which could adversely affect ourbusiness.From time to time, third parties may assert against us or ourcustomers alleged patent, copyright, trademark and otherintellectual property rights to technologies that are importantto our business. We may be subject to intellectual propertyinfringement claims from certain individuals and companies whohave acquired patent portfolios for the sole purpose ofasserting such claims against other companies. Any claims thatour products or processes infringe the intellectual propertyrights of others, regardless of the merit or resolution of suchclaims, could cause us to incur significant costs in respondingto, defending and resolving such claims, and may divert theefforts and attention of our management and technical personnelaway from our business. As a result of such intellectualproperty infringement claims, we could be required to:     pay third-party infringement claims;     discontinue manufacturing, using or selling the infringing    products;     discontinue using the infringing technology or processes;     develop non-infringing technology, which could be time-consuming    and costly or may not be possible; or     license technology from the third party claiming infringement,    which license may not be available on commercially reasonable    terms or at all.The occurrence of any of the foregoing could result inunexpected expenses or require us to recognize an impairment ofour assets, which would reduce the value of our assets andincrease expenses. In addition, if we alter or discontinue ourproduction of affected items, our revenue could be negativelyimpacted.We may be subject to litigation proceedings that couldadversely affect our business.In addition to the litigation risks mentioned above, we may besubject to legal claims or regulatory matters involvingstockholder, consumer, antitrust and other issues. As describedin Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3 ofthis Form 10-K, we are currently engaged in a number oflitigation matters. Litigation is subject to inherentuncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. Anunfavorable ruling could include money damages or, in cases forwhich injunctive relief is sought, an injunction prohibitingIntel from manufacturing or selling one or more products. Werean unfavorable ruling to occur, there exists the possibility ofa material adverse impact on business and results of operationsfor the period in which the ruling occurred or future periods.We may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectualproperty rights, which may harm our ability to compete andadversely affect our business.Our ability to enforce our patents, copyrights, softwarelicenses and other intellectual property is subject to generallitigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to theenforceability of our intellectual property rights in variouscountries. When we seek to enforce our rights, we are oftensubject to claims that the intellectual property right isinvalid, is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to theparty against whom we are asserting a claim. In addition, ourassertion of intellectual property rights often results in theother party seeking to assert alleged intellectual propertyrights of its own against us, which may adversely impact ourbusiness in the manner discussed above. If we are not ultimatelysuccessful in defending ourselves against these claims inlitigation, we may not be able to sell a particular product orfamily of products, due to an injunction, or we may have to paymaterial amounts of damages, which could in turn negativelyaffect our results of operations. In addition, governments mayadopt regulations or courts may render decisions requiringcompulsory licensing of intellectual property to others, orgovernments may require that products meet specified standardsthat serve to favor local companies. Our inability to enforceour intellectual property rights under these circumstances maynegatively impact our competitive position and our business.20Table of ContentsOur licenses with other companies and our participation inindustry initiatives may allow other companies, includingcompetitors, to use our patent rights.Companies in the semiconductor industry often rely on theability to license patents from each other in order to compete.Many of our competitors have broad licenses or cross-licenseswith us, and under current case law, some of these licenses maypermit these competitors to pass our patent rights on to others.If one of these licensees becomes a foundry, our competitorsmight be able to avoid our patent rights in manufacturingcompeting products. In addition, our participation in industryinitiatives may require us to license our patents to othercompanies that adopt certain industry standards orspecifications, even when such organizations do not adoptstandards or specifications proposed by us. As a result, ourpatents implicated by our participation in industry initiativesmight not be available for us to enforce against others whomight otherwise be deemed to be infringing those patents, ourcosts of enforcing our licenses or protecting our patents mayincrease, and the value of our intellectual property may beimpaired.In order to compete, we must attract, retain and motivatekey employees, and our failure to do so could have an adverseeffect on our results of operations.In order to compete, we must attract, retain and motivateexecutives and other key employees, including those inmanagerial, technical, sales, marketing and support positions.Hiring and retaining qualified executives, scientists,engineers, technical staff and sales representatives arecritical to our business, and competition for experiencedemployees in the semiconductor industry can be intense. Toattract, retain and motivate qualified employees, we relyheavily on stock-based incentive awards such as employee stockoptions and restricted stock. If the value of such stock awardsdoes not appreciate as measured by the performance of the priceof our common stock and/or if our other stock-based compensationotherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, our abilityto attract, retain and motivate our employees could be adverselyimpacted, which could negatively affect our results ofoperations and/or require us to increase the amount we expend oncash and other forms of compensation. In addition, our adoptionof Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment,during our first quarter of 2006 will result in significantadditional compensation expense compared to prior periods.Our results of operations could vary as a result of themethods, estimates and judgments we use in applying ouraccounting policies.The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying ouraccounting policies have a significant impact on our results ofoperations (see Critical Accounting Estimates inPart II, Item 7 of thisForm 10-K). Suchmethods, estimates and judgments are, by their nature, subjectto substantial risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and factorsmay arise over time that lead us to change our methods,estimates and judgments. Changes in those methods, estimates andjudgments could significantly affect our results of operations.In particular, beginning in our first quarter of 2006, thecalculation of share-based compensation expense underSFAS No. 123(R) will require us to use valuationmethodologies (which were not developed for use in valuingemployee stock options) and a number of assumptions, estimatesand conclusions regarding matters such as expected forfeitures,expected volatility of our share price, the expected dividendrate with respect to our common stock and the exercise behaviorof our employees. Furthermore, there are no means, underapplicable accounting principles, to compare and adjust ourexpense if and when we learn of additional information that mayaffect the estimates that we previously made, with the exceptionof changes in expected forfeitures of share-based awards.Factors may arise over time that lead us to change our estimatesand assumptions with respect to future share-based compensationarrangements, resulting in variability in our share-basedcompensation expense over time. Changes in forecastedshare-based compensation expense could impact our gross marginpercentage; research and development expenses; marketing,general and administrative expenses; and our tax rate.Our failure to comply with applicable environmental lawsand regulations worldwide could adversely impact our businessand results of operations.The manufacture, assembly and testing of our products requirethe use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad arrayof environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Ourfailure to comply with any of these applicable laws orregulations could result in:     regulatory penalties, fines and legal liabilities;     suspension of production;     alteration of our fabrication and assembly and test    processes; or     curtailment of our operations or sales.In addition, our failure to properly manage the use,transportation, emission, discharge, storage, recycling ordisposal of hazardous materials could subject us to increasedcosts or future liabilities. Existing and future environmentallaws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollutionabatement or remediation equipment, modify our product designsor incur other expenses associated with such laws andregulations. Many new materials that we are evaluating for usein our operations may be subject to regulation under existing orfuture environmental laws and regulations that may restrict ouruse of certain materials in our manufacturing, assembly and testprocesses or products. Any of these consequences could adverselyimpact our business and results of operations by increasing ourexpenses and/or requiring us to alter our manufacturingprocesses.21Table of ContentsChanges in our effective tax rate may have an adverseeffect on our results of operations.Our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected by anumber of factors including:     the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned    and taxed;     the repatriation of    non-U.S. earnings    for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes;     adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax    returns;     increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including    write-offs of acquired in-process research and development and    impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions;     changes in available tax credits;     changes in share-based compensation expense;     changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and    liabilities;     changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax    laws; and     the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various    tax authorities.Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates couldadversely impact net income for future periods.In addition, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) andother tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns.The IRS has issued formal assessments related to amountsreflected on certain of our tax returns as a tax benefit for ourexport sales (see Note 18: Contingencies inPart II, Item 8 of thisForm 10-K). Ourresults of operations could be adversely impacted if theseassessments or any other assessments resulting from theexamination of our income tax returns by the IRS or other taxingauthorities are not resolved in our favor.We invest in companies for strategic reasons and may notrealize a return on our investments.We make investments in companies around the world to further ourstrategic objectives and support our key business initiatives.Such investments include investments in equity securities ofpublic companies and investments in non-marketable equitysecurities of private companies, which range from early-stagecompanies that are often still defining their strategicdirection to more mature companies whose products ortechnologies may directly support an Intel product orinitiative. The success of these companies (or lack thereof) isdependent on product development, market acceptance, operationalefficiency and other key business success factors. The privatecompanies in which we invest may fail because they may not beable to secure additional funding, obtain favorable investmentterms for future financings or take advantage of liquidityevents, such as initial public offerings, mergers and privatesales. If any of these private companies fail, we could lose allor part of our investment in that company. In addition, if wedetermine that an other-than-temporary decline in the fair valueexists for the equity securities of the public and privatecompanies in which we invest, we write down the investment toits fair value and record the related write-down as aninvestment loss. Furthermore, when the strategic objectives ofan investment have been achieved, or if the investment orbusiness diverges from our strategic objectives, we may decideto dispose of the investment. Our investments in non-marketableequity securities of private companies are not liquid, and wemay not be able to dispose of these investments on favorableterms or at all. The occurrence of any of these events couldnegatively affect our net income and results of operations.22Table of Contents"
