8,GTY,GETTY REALTY CORP,2024-02-15,"Risk Factors
We are subject to various risks, many of which are beyond our control. As a result of these and other factors, we may experience material fluctuations in our future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. An investment in our stock involves various risks, including those mentioned below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and those that are described from time to time in our other filings with the SEC.Summary of Risk Factors
Our business is subject to risks and uncertainties, including those risks and uncertainties discussed at-length below, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following:Risks Related to Our Business and Operations•The risks inherent in owning or leasing real estate. •The real estate industry is highly competitive. •Our future cash flow is dependent on the performance of our tenants of their lease obligations, renewal of existing leases and either re-leasing or selling our properties.•Significant number of our tenants depend on the same industry for their revenues. •It may be difficult for our investors to determine the creditworthiness of most of our tenants.•An increase in costs and liability accruals as a result of environmental laws and regulations could adversely affect our business. •We are defending pending lawsuits and claims that may subject us to material losses. •We may be subject to losses that may not be covered by insurance. •The relative concentration of a material number of our properties in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, and adverse conditions in those regions, in particular, could negatively impact our operations.•Property taxes on our properties may increase without notice. 9 •Our business operations may not generate sufficient cash for distributions or debt service.•Adverse developments in general business, economic or political conditions could have a material adverse effect on us.•Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the market on which our common stock trades, the markets in which we operate, our operations and our results of operations (including current geopolitical conflicts in Europe and the Middle East and the related impact on macroeconomic conditions as a result of such conflicts).•Our exposure to counterparty risk.•Inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.•Our assets may be subject to impairment charges. •Our accounting policies and methods require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain.•Amendments to the Accounting Standards Codification made by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) or changes in accounting standards may adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability, or financial position.•If we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately and timely report our financial results.•Our reliance on certain members of our management team or Board of Directors, the loss of any one of which could adversely affect our business or the market price of our common stock. •Our reliance on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business.•Our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be impacted by current or future outbreaks of highly infectious or contagious diseases, including COVID-19.Risks Related to Financing Our Business•Our dependency on external sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. •Interest rate risk and our ability to manage or mitigate this risk effectively. Risks Related to Our Investment Strategy•We may not be able to successfully implement our investment strategy. •We expect to acquire new properties and this may create risks. •We are pursuing redevelopment opportunities and this creates risks to our Company. Risks Related to Our Status as a REIT•The failure to qualify as a REIT under the federal income tax laws would have adverse consequences to our stockholders. Uncertain tax matters may have a significant impact on the results of operations for any single fiscal year or interim period or may cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT.•The uncertainty regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the cash that we might receive from cash settlement of a forward sale agreement under our at-the-market equity offering program could jeopardize our ability to meet the REIT qualification requirements.•A risk of changes in the tax law applicable to REITs.•U.S. federal tax reform legislation could affect REITs generally, our tenants, the markets in which we operate, the price of our common stock and our results of operations.•In order to preserve our REIT status, our charter limits the number of shares a person may own, which may discourage a takeover that could result in a premium price for our common stock or otherwise benefit our stockholders.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Securities•Changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded common stock.10 •Changes in our dividend policy and the dividends we pay may be subject to significant volatility.•Our forward sale agreements under our at-the-market equity offering program could result in substantial dilution to our earnings per share and return on equity or result in substantial cash payment obligations.•In case of our bankruptcy or insolvency, any forward sale agreement that is in effect under our at-the-market equity offering program will automatically terminate, and we would not receive the expected proceeds.•Future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our equity securities.•Maryland law may discourage a third-party from acquiring us.Risks Related to Our Business and OperationsWe are subject to risks inherent in owning and leasing real estate.We are subject to varying degrees of risk generally related to leasing and owning real estate, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to general risks applicable to us, our risks include, among others: our liability as a lessee for long-term lease obligations regardless of our revenues; deterioration in national, regional and local economic and real estate market conditions; potential changes in supply of, or demand for, rental properties similar to ours; competition for tenants and declining rental rates; difficulty in selling or re-leasing properties on favorable terms or at all; impairments in our ability to collect rent or other payments due to us when they are due; increases in interest rates and adverse changes in the availability, cost and terms of financing; uninsured property liability; the impact of present or future environmental legislation and compliance with environmental laws; adverse changes in zoning laws and other regulations; acts of terrorism and war; acts of God; the unforeseen impacts of climate change, compliance with any future laws or regulations designed to prevent or mitigate the impacts of climate change, and any material costs related thereto; the potential risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time the need to periodically renovate and repair our properties; and physical or weather-related damage to our properties. Certain significant expenditures generally do not change in response to economic or other conditions, including: (i) debt service, (ii) real estate taxes, (iii) environmental remediation costs and (iv) operating and maintenance costs. The combination of variable revenue and relatively fixed expenditures may result, under certain market conditions, in reduced earnings and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.Each of the factors listed above could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. In addition, real estate investments are relatively illiquid, which means that our ability to vary our portfolio of properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be limited.We are in a competitive business.The real estate industry is highly competitive. Where we own properties, we compete for tenants with a large number of real estate property owners and other companies that sublet properties. Our principal means of competition are rents we are able to charge in relation to the income producing potential of the location. In addition, we expect other major real estate investors, some with much greater financial resources or more experienced personnel than we have, will compete with us for attractive acquisition opportunities. These competitors include petroleum manufacturing, distributing and marketing companies, convenience store retailers, other REITs, public and private investment funds, and other individual and institutional investors. This competition has increased prices for properties we seek to acquire and may impair our ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms in the future.Our future cash flow is dependent on the performance of our tenants of their lease obligations, renewal of existing leases and either re-leasing or selling our properties.We are subject to risks that financial distress, default or bankruptcy of our tenants may lead to vacancy at our properties or disruption in rent receipts as a result of partial payment or nonpayment of rent or that expiring leases may not be renewed. Under unfavorable general economic conditions, there can be no assurance that our tenants’ level of sales and financial performance generally will not be adversely affected, which in turn could negatively impact our rental revenues. We are subject to risks that the terms governing renewal or re-leasing of our properties (including, compliance with numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment, such as the remediation of contamination and the retirement and decommissioning or removal of long-lived assets, the cost of required renovations, or replacement of USTs and related equipment) may be less favorable than current lease terms.We are also subject to the risk that we may receive less net proceeds from the properties we sell as compared to their current carrying value or that the value of our properties may be adversely affected by unfavorable general economic conditions. Unfavorable general economic conditions may also negatively impact our ability to re-lease or sell our properties. Numerous properties compete with our properties in attracting tenants to lease space. The number of available or competitive properties in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease or sell our properties and on the rents we are able to charge. In addition to the risk of disruption in rent receipts, we are subject to the risk of incurring real estate taxes, maintenance, environmental and other expenses at 11 vacant properties. The financial distress, default or bankruptcy of our tenants may also lead to protracted and expensive processes for retaking control of our properties than would otherwise be the case, including, eviction or other legal proceedings related to or resulting from the tenant’s default. These risks are greater with respect to certain of our tenants who lease multiple properties from us. If a tenant files for bankruptcy protection it is possible that we would recover substantially less than the full value of our claims against the tenant. If (i) our tenants do not perform their lease obligations, (ii) we are unable to renew existing leases and promptly recapture and re-lease or sell our properties, (iii) lease terms upon renewal or re-leasing are less favorable than current or historical lease terms, (iv) the values of properties that we sell are adversely affected by market conditions, or (v) we incur significant costs or disruption related to or resulting from tenant financial distress, default or bankruptcy, then our cash flow could be significantly adversely affected.Significant number of our tenants depend on the same industry for their revenues. We derive significant portion of our revenues from leasing, primarily on a triple-net basis, and financing convenience store and gasoline station properties to tenants in the petroleum marketing industry. Accordingly, significant portion of our revenues depend on the economic success of the petroleum marketing industry, and any factors that adversely affect that industry, such as disruption in the supply of petroleum or a decrease in the demand for conventional motor fuels due to conservation, technological advancements in petroleum-fueled motor vehicles or an increase in the use of, and consumer demand for, alternative fuel, electric and battery-operated vehicles, or other “green technologies,” could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. Similarly, governmental regulations regarding climate change and the greenhouse gas emissions may accelerate these trends that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. The success of participants in the petroleum marketing industry depends upon the sale of refined petroleum products at margins in excess of fixed and variable expenses. The petroleum marketing industry is highly competitive and volatile. Petroleum products are commodities, the prices of which depend on numerous factors that affect supply and demand. The prices paid by our tenants and other petroleum marketers for products are affected by global, national and regional factors. A large, rapid increase in wholesale petroleum prices would adversely affect the profitability and cash flows of our tenants if the increased cost of petroleum products could not be passed on to their customers or if automobile consumption of gasoline was to decline significantly. We cannot be certain as to how these factors will affect petroleum product prices or supply in the future, or how in particular they will affect our tenants.Because certain of our tenants are not rated and their financial information is not available to you, it may be difficult for our investors to determine their creditworthiness.The majority of our properties are leased to tenants who are not rated by any nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. In addition, our tenants’ financial information is not generally available to our investors. Additionally, many of our tenants are part of larger corporate organizations and we do not receive financial information for the other entities in those organizations. The financial distress of other affiliated companies or businesses in those organizations may negatively impact the ability or willingness of our tenant to perform its obligations under its lease with us. Because of the lack of financial information or credit ratings it is, therefore, difficult for our investors to assess the creditworthiness of our tenants and to determine the ability of our tenants to meet their obligations to us. It is possible that the assumptions and estimates we make after reviewing publicly and privately obtained information about our tenants are not accurate and that we may be required to increase reserves for bad debts, record allowances for deferred rent receivable or record additional expenses if our tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations to us.We incur significant operating costs and, from time to time, may have significant liability accruals as a result of environmental laws and regulations, which costs and accruals could significantly increase, and reduce our profitability or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, including matters relating to the protection of the environment. Under certain environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at, on, or under, such property, and may be required to investigate and clean-up such contamination. Such laws typically impose liability and clean-up responsibility first on the party responsible for the contamination, but can also impose liability and clean-up responsibility on the owner and the current operator without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants, or the timing or cause of the contamination. Liability under such environmental laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility and the financial resources are available to perform the remediation. For example, liability may arise as a result of the historical use of a property or from the migration of contamination from adjacent or nearby properties. Any such contamination or liability may also reduce the value of the property. In addition, the owner or operator of a property may be subject to claims by third-parties based on injury, damage and/or costs, including investigation and clean-up costs, resulting from environmental contamination present at or emanating from a property. We cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations may be enacted in the future, or how existing laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted with respect to products or activities to which they have not previously been applied. Additionally, compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of the regulatory agencies or stricter interpretation of existing laws, which may develop in the 12 future, could have an adverse effect on our financial position, or that of our tenants, and could require substantial additional expenditures for future remediation. Accordingly, compliance with environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.The majority of the properties owned or controlled by us are leased as convenience store and gasoline station properties, and therefore may contain, or may have contained, USTs for the storage of petroleum products and other hazardous or toxic substances, which creates a potential for the release of such products or substances. Some of our properties are subject to regulations regarding the retirement and decommissioning or removal of long-lived assets including buildings containing hazardous materials, USTs and other equipment. Some of the properties may be adjacent to or near properties that have contained or currently contain USTs used to store petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, certain of the properties are on, adjacent to, or near properties upon which others have engaged or may in the future engage in activities that may release petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. There may be other environmental problems associated with our properties of which we are unaware. These problems may make it more difficult for us to re-lease or sell our properties on favorable terms, or at all.We enter into leases and various other agreements which contractually allocate responsibility between the parties for known and unknown environmental liabilities at or relating to the subject properties. Under applicable laws, we are contingently liable for these environmental obligations in the event that our tenant does not satisfy them, and we are required to accrue for environmental liabilities that we believe are allocable to others under our leases if we determine that it is probable that our tenant will not meet its environmental obligations. It is possible that our assumptions regarding the ultimate allocation method and share of responsibility that we used to allocate environmental liabilities may change, which may result in material adjustments to the amounts recorded for environmental litigation accruals and environmental remediation liabilities. We assess whether to accrue for environmental liabilities based upon relevant factors including our tenants’ histories of paying for such obligations, our assessment of their financial capability, and their intent to pay for such obligations. However, there can be no assurance that our assessments are correct or that our tenants who have paid their obligations in the past will continue to do so. We may ultimately be responsible to pay for environmental liabilities as the property owner if our tenant fails to pay them. The ultimate resolution of these matters could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.For substantially all of our triple-net leases, our tenants are contractually responsible for compliance with environmental laws and regulations, removal of USTs at the end of their lease term (the cost of which in certain cases is partially borne by us) and remediation of any environmental contamination that arises during the term of their tenancy. Under the terms of our leases covering properties previously leased to Getty Petroleum Marketing Inc. (“Marketing”) (substantially all of which commenced in 2012), we agreed to be responsible for environmental contamination at the premises that was known at the time the lease commenced, and for environmental contamination which existed prior to commencement of the lease and is discovered (other than as a result of a voluntary site investigation) during the first 10 years of the lease term (or a shorter period for a minority of such leases). Substantially all of these 10-year (or, in certain cases, shorter) “look back” periods have now expired, therefore responsibility for all newly discovered contamination, even if it relates to periods prior to commencement of these leases, is contractually allocated to our tenant. Our tenants at properties previously leased to Marketing are in all cases contractually responsible for the cost of any remediation of contamination that results from their use and occupancy of our properties. Under substantially all of our other triple-net leases (i.e., leases covering properties not previously leased to Marketing), contractual responsibility for remediation of all environmental contamination discovered during the term of the lease (including known and unknown contamination that existed prior to commencement of the lease) is the responsibility of our tenant.For additional information regarding pending environmental lawsuits and claims, and environmental remediation obligations and estimates, see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings”, “Environmental Matters” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Notes 3 and 6 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K.Environmental exposures are difficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons, including the amount of data available upon initial assessment of contamination, alternative treatment methods that may be applied, location of the property which subjects it to differing local laws and regulations and their interpretations, changes in costs associated with environmental remediation services and equipment, the availability of state UST remediation funds and the possibility of existing legal claims giving rise to allocation of responsibilities to others, as well as the time it takes to remediate contamination and receive regulatory approval. In developing our liability for estimated environmental remediation obligations on a property by property basis, we consider, among other things, laws and regulations, assessments of contamination and surrounding geology, quality of information available, currently available technologies for treatment, alternative methods of remediation and prior experience. Environmental accruals are based on estimates derived upon facts known to us at this time, which are subject to significant change as circumstances change, and as environmental contingencies become more clearly defined and reasonably estimable.We cannot predict if state UST fund programs will be administered and funded in the future in a manner that is consistent with past practices and if future environmental spending will continue to be eligible for reimbursement at historical recovery rates under these programs. As a result, our estimates in respect of recoveries from state UST remediation funds could change, which could adversely affect our accruals for environmental remediation liabilities.13 Any changes to our estimates or our assumptions that form the basis of our estimates may result in our providing an accrual, or adjustments to the amounts recorded, for environmental remediation liabilities. Additional environmental liabilities could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.We are defending pending lawsuits and claims and are subject to material losses.We are subject to various lawsuits and claims, including litigation related to environmental matters, such as those arising from leaking USTs, contamination of groundwater with methyl tertiary butyl ether (a fuel derived from methanol, commonly referred to as “MTBE”) and releases of motor fuel into the environment, and toxic tort claims. The ultimate resolution of certain matters cannot be predicted because considerable uncertainty exists both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimate of such loss. Our ultimate liabilities resulting from the lawsuits and claims we face could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. For additional information with respect to certain pending lawsuits and claims, see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” and Note 3 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K.We are subject to losses that may not be covered by insurance.We and our tenants carry insurance against certain risks and in such amounts as we believe are customary for businesses of our kind. However, as the costs and availability of insurance change, we may decide not to be covered against certain losses (such as certain environmental liabilities, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and civil disorder) where, in the judgment of management, the insurance is not warranted due to cost or availability of coverage or the remoteness of perceived risk. Furthermore, there are certain types of losses, such as losses resulting from wars, terrorism or certain acts of God, that generally are not insured because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. There is no assurance that the existing insurance coverages are or will be sufficient to cover actual losses incurred. The destruction of, or significant damage to, or significant liabilities arising out of conditions at, our properties due to an uninsured loss would result in an economic loss and could result in us losing both our investment in, and anticipated profits from, such properties. When a loss is insured, the coverage may be insufficient in amount or duration, or a lessee’s customers may be lost, such that the lessee cannot resume its business after the loss at prior levels or at all, resulting in reduced rent or a default under its lease. Any such loss relating to a large number of properties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.A material portion of our properties are concentrated in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, and adverse conditions in those regions, in particular, could negatively impact our operations.A significant portion of the properties we own and lease are located in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States and, as of December 31, 2023, 32.0% of our annual base rent is derived from four states (New York, Massachusetts, Maryland, and Connecticut). Because of the relative concentration of our properties in those regions, in the event of adverse economic conditions in those regions, we would likely experience higher risk of default on payment of rent to us than if our properties were more geographically diversified. Additionally, the rents on our properties may be subject to a greater risk of default than other properties in the event of adverse economic, political or business developments, natural disasters or severe weather that may affect the Northeast or Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States and the ability of our lessees to make rent payments. This relative lack of geographical diversification could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.Property taxes on our properties may increase without notice.Each of the properties we own or lease is subject to real property taxes. The leases for certain of the properties that we lease from third-parties obligate us to pay real property taxes with regard to those properties. The real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we acquire or lease in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities. To the extent that our tenants are unable or unwilling to pay such increase in accordance with their leases, our net operating expenses may increase.Our business operations may not generate sufficient cash for distributions or debt service.There is no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay dividends on our common stock, to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may not be able to repay or refinance existing indebtedness on favorable terms, which could force us to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms (which may also result in losses) or accept financing on unfavorable terms.Adverse developments in general business, economic or political conditions could have a material adverse effect on us.Adverse developments in general business and economic conditions, including through recession, downturn or otherwise, either in the economy generally or in those regions in which a large portion of our business is conducted, could have a material adverse effect on us and significantly increase certain of the risks we are subject to. Among other effects, adverse economic conditions could depress real estate values, impact our ability to re-lease or sell our properties and have an adverse effect on our tenants’ level of sales and financial performance generally. As our revenues are substantially dependent on the economic success of our tenants, any factors that 14 adversely impact our tenants could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the market on which our common stock trades, the markets in which we operate, our operations and our results of operations (including current geopolitical conflicts in Europe and Middle East and the related impact on macroeconomic conditions as a result of such conflicts).Terrorist attacks or other acts of violence or war (including current geopolitical conflicts in Europe and Middle East and the related impact on macroeconomic conditions as a result of such conflicts) could negatively affect our business or the businesses of our tenants. These attacks may directly or indirectly impact the physical facilities, networks or the business or the financial condition of us or those of our tenants, vendors or financial institutions with which we have a relationship or conduct business. The consequences of armed conflicts are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. More generally, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States and worldwide financial markets and economy. Terrorist attacks also could be a factor resulting in, or which could exacerbate, an economic recession in the United States or abroad. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.We are exposed to counterparty risk and there can be no assurances that we will effectively manage or mitigate this risk.We regularly interact with counterparties in various industries. The types of counterparties most common to our transactions and agreements include, but are not limited to, landlords, tenants, vendors and lenders. We also enter into agreements to acquire and sell properties which allocate responsibility for certain costs to the counterparty. Our most significant counterparties include, but are not limited to, the members of the bank syndicate related to our to our credit agreements, the lenders that are the counterparties to our note purchase agreements, and our major tenants from whom we derive a significant amount of rental revenue. The default, insolvency or other inability or unwillingness of a significant counterparty to perform its obligations under an agreement, including, without limitation, as a result of the rejection of an agreement in bankruptcy proceedings, is likely to have a material adverse effect on us. As of December 31, 2023, we leased:•150 properties in four separate unitary leases to subsidiaries of ARKO Corp. which represented, in the aggregate, 15% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023.•150 properties in three separate unitary leases and two stand-alone leases to subsidiaries of Global Partners LP which represented, in the aggregate, 14% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023.•77 properties in three separate unitary leases and one stand-alone lease to Apro, LLC (d/b/a United Oil) which, in the aggregate, represented 10% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023. We may also undertake additional transactions with these or other existing tenants, which would further concentrate our sources of rental revenues. Many of our tenants, including those noted above, are part of larger corporate organizations and the financial distress of one subsidiary or other affiliated companies or businesses in those organizations may negatively impact the ability or willingness of our tenant to perform its obligations under its lease with us. The failure of a major tenant or their default in their rental and other obligations to us is likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.Inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Although inflation has not materially impacted our results of operations in the recent past, increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations. During times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, as provided for in our leases, rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation. Likewise, even though our triple-net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation, substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue, which may adversely affect our tenants’ ability to pay rent.Also, during inflationary periods, interest rates have historically increased, which would have a direct effect on the interest expense of our borrowings. Our exposure to increases in interest rates in the short term is limited to our variable-rate borrowings, which consist of borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Additionally, inflationary pricing may have a negative effect on the real estate acquisitions and construction costs necessary to complete our development and redevelopment projects, including, but not limited to, costs of construction materials, labor, and services from third-party contractors and suppliers. Higher acquisition and construction costs could adversely impact our net investments in real estate and expected yields on our development and redevelopment projects, which may make otherwise lucrative investment opportunities less profitable to us. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, as well as our ability to pay dividends, could be adversely affected over time.15 Our assets may be subject to impairment charges.We periodically evaluate our real estate investments and other assets for impairment indicators. The judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), and includes a variety of factors such as market conditions, the accumulation of asset retirement costs due to changes in estimates associated with our estimated environmental liabilities, the status of significant leases, the financial condition of major tenants, and other assumptions and factors that could affect the cash flow from or fair value of our properties. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we incurred $5.2 million and $3.5 million, respectively, of impairment charges. We may be required to take similar impairment charges, which could affect the implementation of our current business strategy and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial position and results of operations, and they require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain.Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial position and results of operations. We have identified several accounting policies as being critical to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations because they require management to make particularly subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be recorded under different conditions or using different assumptions. We cannot provide any assurance that we will not make subsequent significant adjustments to our consolidated financial statements. Estimates, judgments and assumptions underlying our consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, receivables and related reserves, deferred rent receivable, income under direct financing leases, asset retirement obligations (including environmental remediation obligations and future environmental liabilities for pre-existing unknown environmental contamination), real estate, depreciation and amortization, carrying value of our properties, impairment of long-lived assets, litigation, accrued liabilities, income taxes and allocation of the purchase price of properties acquired to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If our accounting policies, methods, judgments, assumptions, estimates and allocations prove to be incorrect, or if circumstances change, our business, financial condition, revenues, operating expense, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price may be materially adversely affected.Amendments to the Accounting Standards Codification made by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) or changes in accounting standards issued by other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability or financial position.Our consolidated financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification, which is periodically amended by the FASB. The application of GAAP is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, we are required to adopt amendments to the Accounting Standards Codification or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time-to-time by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB and the SEC. Those changes could adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability or financial position.If we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately and timely report our financial results.Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, effectively prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. We are required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.As a result of material weaknesses or significant deficiencies that may be identified in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may also identify certain deficiencies in some of our disclosure controls and procedures that we believe require remediation. If we or our independent registered public accounting firm discover any such weaknesses or deficiencies, we will make efforts to further improve our internal control over financial reporting controls. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful. Any failure to maintain effective controls or timely effect any necessary improvement of our internal control over financial reporting controls could harm operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, which could affect the listing of our common stock on the NYSE. Ineffective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the per share trading price of our common stock.The loss of certain members of our management team or Board of Directors could adversely affect our business or the market price of our common stock.Our future success and ability to implement our business and investment strategy depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key management personnel and directors, and on the continued contributions of such persons, each of whom may be difficult to 16 replace. As a REIT, we employ only 32 employees and have a cost-effective management structure. We do not have any employment agreements with any of our executives. In the event of the loss of key management personnel or directors, or upon unexpected death, disability or retirement, we may not be able to find replacements with comparable skill, ability and industry expertise, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. Additionally, certain of our directors beneficially own more than 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If any of these directors cease to be a director of the Company and they or their estate sell a significant portion of such holdings into the public market, it could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.We rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business. Additionally, our failure to comply with applicable privacy, data security or protection or cyber security laws could adversely affect our business.We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, including financial transactions and maintenance of records, which may include personal identifying information of tenants and lease data. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting and storing confidential tenant information, such as individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts. Although we have taken steps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems, it is possible that our security measures will not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning, or the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber attacks. Security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, whether of our systems or those of our vendors or other third parties who hold or have access to our information, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Any failure by us, or our vendors or other third parties who hold or have access to our information to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect us.In the future, we directly or through our third-party provided information technology systems or software may incorporate artificial intelligence (“AI”) capabilities into our business. As with many innovations, AI presents risks, challenges, and unintended consequences that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI algorithms and training methodologies may be flawed, ineffective or inadequate. The rapid evolution of AI, particularly the anticipated government regulation of AI, could require significant resources for compliance, whether in the development, testing or maintenance of such systems or software. AI development or deployment practices by us or third-party providers could result in incidents that could increase the resources we need to implement cybersecurity measures to protect the security of our data. These deficiencies and other failures of any potential AI systems could subject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm.Governments are continuing to focus on privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, data security, and AI and it is possible that new privacy or data security laws will be passed or existing laws will be amended in a way that is material to our business. Any significant change to applicable laws, regulations, or industry practices regarding our employees’ and users’ data could require us to modify our business, services and products features, possibly in a material manner, and may limit our ability to develop new products, services, and features. Although we have made efforts to design our policies, procedures, and systems to comply with the current requirements of applicable state, federal, and foreign laws, changes to applicable laws and regulations in this area could subject us to additional regulation and oversight, any of which could significantly increase our operating costs.Our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be impacted by current or future outbreak of other highly infectious or contagious diseases, including COVID-19, and such impact could be materially adverse.The global spread of COVID-19 created significant volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption. The extent to which COVID-19, or the future outbreak of other highly infectious or contagious diseases, impacts our business, operations and financial results is uncertain, and will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including governmental, business, and individual actions taken in response to any such outbreak and the impact of those actions on global economic activity; the actions taken in response to economic disruption; the reduced economic activity, if not closures from time to time of our tenants’ facilities, may impact our tenants' businesses, financial condition and liquidity, and may cause one or more of our tenants to be unable to meet their obligations to us in full, or at all, or to otherwise seek modifications of such obligations; general decline in business activity and demand for real estate transactions could adversely affect our ability or desire to grow our portfolio of properties; the financial impact of any such outbreak could negatively impact our future compliance with the financial covenants of our various borrowings and result in a default and potentially an acceleration of indebtedness, which non-compliance could negatively impact our ability to make additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility and pay dividends; and a deterioration in our or our tenants’ ability to operate in affected areas or delays in the supply of products or services to us or our tenants from vendors that are needed for our or our tenants’ efficient operations could adversely affect our operations and those of our tenants. 17 Risks Related to Financing Our BusinessWe are dependent on external sources of capital which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.We are dependent on external sources of capital to maintain our status as a REIT and must distribute to our stockholders each year at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding any net capital gain. Because of these distribution requirements, it is not likely that we will be able to fund all future capital needs, including acquisitions, from income from operations. Therefore, we will have to continue to rely on third-party sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. We may need to access the capital markets in order to execute future significant acquisitions. There can be no assurance that sources of capital will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.Our principal sources of liquidity include cash flows from operations, funds available under our revolving credit facility, proceeds from the offering of new debt or equity securities, including the sale of our common stock under our at-the-market equity offering program, and available cash and cash equivalents.The credit and note purchase agreements governing our borrowings contain customary financial covenants such as leverage, coverage ratios and minimum tangible net worth, as well as limitations on restricted payments, which may limit our ability to incur additional debt or pay dividends. These agreements also contain customary events of default, including cross defaults to each other, change of control and failure to maintain REIT status. Our ability to meet the terms of the agreements is dependent upon our continued ability to meet certain criteria, as further described in Note 4 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K, the performance of our tenants, and the other risks described in this section. If we are not in compliance with one or more of our covenants, which could result in an event of default under these agreements, there can be no assurance that our lenders would waive such non-compliance. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.We have filed a registration statement with the SEC allowing us to offer, from time to time, an indefinite amount of equity and debt securities on an as-needed basis, including shares of our common stock under our at-the-market equity program. The offering of new debt and equity securities will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us, including among others, market conditions, prevailing interest rates, and the trading price of our common stock.Our access to third-party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors including general market conditions, the market’s perception of our growth potential, financial stability, our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions, covenants and limitations imposed under our credit and note purchase agreements, and the market price of our common stock.We are exposed to interest rate risk and there can be no assurances that we will manage or mitigate this risk effectively.We are exposed to interest rate risk, primarily as a result of our revolving credit facility. Borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at a floating rate and, accordingly, an increase in interest rates will increase the amount of interest we must pay under our revolving credit facility. Our interest rate risk may materially change in the future if we increase our borrowings under the revolving credit facility, amend the credit and note purchase agreements governing our borrowings, seek other sources of debt or equity capital, or refinance our outstanding indebtedness. A significant increase in interest rates could also make it more difficult to find alternative financing on desirable terms. For additional information with respect to interest rate risk, see “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in this Form 10-K.Risks Related to Our Investment StrategyWe may not be able to successfully implement our investment strategy.We may not be able to successfully implement our investment strategy. We cannot assure that our portfolio of properties will expand at all, or if it will expand at any specified rate or to any specified size. As part of our overall growth strategy, we regularly review acquisition, financing and redevelopment opportunities, and we expect to continue to pursue investments that we believe will benefit our financial performance. We cannot assure that investment opportunities which meet our investment criteria will be available. Pursuing our investment opportunities may result in additional debt or new equity issuances, that may initially be dilutive to our net income, and such investments may not perform as we expect or produce the returns that we anticipate (including, without limitation, as a result of tenant bankruptcies, tenant concessions, our inability to collect rents and higher than anticipated operating expenses). Further, we may not be able to successfully integrate investments into our existing portfolio without operating disruptions or unanticipated costs. To the extent that our current sources of liquidity are not sufficient to fund such investments, we will require other sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Additionally, to the extent that we increase the size of our portfolio, we may not be able to adapt our management, administrative, accounting and operational systems, or hire and retain sufficient operational staff to integrate investments into our portfolio or manage any future investments without operating disruptions or unanticipated costs. Moreover, our continued growth will require increased investment in management personnel, professional fees, other personnel, financial and management systems and controls and facilities, which will result in additional operating expenses. Under the circumstances described above, our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects may be materially adversely affected.18 We expect to acquire new properties and this may create risks.We may acquire properties when we believe that an acquisition matches our business and investment strategies. These properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential. It is possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline after we acquire them, or that they may not perform as expected. Further, if financed by additional debt or new equity issuances, our acquisition of properties may result in stockholder dilution. Our acquisition of properties will expose us to the liabilities of those properties, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of such acquisitions. We face competition in pursuing these acquisitions and we may not succeed in leasing acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of their acquisition and operations.Newly acquired properties may require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. We may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions. Consequences arising from or in connection with any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.We are pursuing redevelopment opportunities and this creates risks to our Company.We have commenced a program to redevelop certain of our properties, and to recapture select properties from our net lease portfolio in order to redevelop such properties, for either a new convenience and gasoline use or for alternative single tenant net lease retail uses. The success at each stage of our redevelopment program is dependent on numerous factors and risks, including our ability to identify and extract qualified sites from our portfolio and successfully prepare and market them for alternative uses, and project development issues, including those relating to planning, zoning, licensing, permitting, third party and governmental authorizations, changes in local market conditions, increases in construction costs, the availability and cost of financing, and issues arising from possible discovery of new environmental contamination and the need to conduct environmental remediation. Occupancy rates and rents at any particular redeveloped property may fail to meet our original expectations for reasons beyond our control, including changes in market and economic conditions and the development by competitors of competing properties. We could experience increased and unexpected costs or significant delays or abandonment of some or all of these redevelopment opportunities. For any of the above-described reasons, and others, we may determine to abandon opportunities that we have already begun to explore or with respect to which we have commenced redevelopment efforts and, as a result, we may fail to recover expenses already incurred. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully redevelop and lease any of our identified opportunities or that our overall redevelopment program will be successful. Consequences arising from or in connection with any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.Risks Related to Our Status as a REITFailure to qualify as a REIT under the federal income tax laws would have adverse consequences to our stockholders. Uncertain tax matters may have a significant impact on the results of operations for any single fiscal year or interim period or may cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT.We elected to be treated as a REIT under the federal income tax laws beginning January 1, 2001. To qualify for taxation as a REIT, we must, among other requirements such as those related to the composition of our assets and gross income, distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income, including taxable income that is accrued by us without a corresponding receipt of cash. Accordingly, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on qualifying REIT income, provided that distributions to our stockholders equal at least the amount of our taxable income as defined under the Internal Revenue Code. But, we may have to borrow money or sell assets to satisfy such distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. Many of the REIT requirements are highly technical and complex. If we were to fail to meet the requirements, we may be subject to federal income tax, excise taxes, penalties and interest or we may have to pay a deficiency dividend. We may have to borrow money or sell assets to pay such a deficiency dividend.We cannot guarantee that we will continue to qualify in the future as a REIT. We cannot give any assurance that new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the requirements relating to our qualification. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and will again be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates, we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax for taxable years beginning before 2019, we could be required to pay significant income taxes and we would have less money available for our operations and distributions to stockholders. This would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities. We could also be precluded from treatment as a REIT for four taxable years following the year in which we lost the qualification, and all distributions to stockholders would be taxable as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Loss of our REIT status could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.The U.S. federal income tax treatment of the cash that we might receive from cash settlement of a forward sale agreement under our at-the market equity offering program is unclear and could jeopardize our ability to meet the REIT qualification requirements.19 In the event that we elect to settle any forward sale agreement for cash and the settlement price is below the applicable forward sale price, we would be entitled to receive a cash payment from the relevant Forward Purchaser. Under Section 1032 of the Code, generally, no gains and losses are recognized by a corporation in dealing in its own shares, including pursuant to a “securities futures contract,” as defined in the Code by reference to the Exchange Act. Although we believe that any amount received by us in exchange for our stock would qualify for the exemption under Section 1032 of the Code, because it is not entirely clear whether a forward sale agreement qualifies as a “securities futures contract,” the U.S. federal income tax treatment of any cash settlement payment we receive is uncertain. In the event that we recognize a significant gain from the cash settlement of a forward sale agreement, we might not be able to satisfy the gross income requirements applicable to REITs under the Code. In that case, we may be able to rely upon the relief provisions under the Code in order to avoid the loss of our REIT status. Even if the relief provisions apply, we will be subject to a 100% tax on the greater of (i) the excess of 75% of our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) over the amount of such income attributable to sources that qualify under the 75% test or (ii) the excess of 95% of our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) over the amount of such gross income attributable to sources that qualify under the 95% test, multiplied in either case by a fraction intended to reflect our profitability. In the event that these relief provisions were not available, we could lose our REIT status under the Code.There is a risk of changes in the tax law applicable to real estate investment trusts.Because the IRS, the United States Treasury Department and Congress frequently review federal income tax legislation, we cannot predict whether, when or to what extent new federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be adopted. Any of such legislative actions may prospectively or retroactively modify our tax treatment and, therefore, may adversely affect taxation of us and/or our investors.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the TCJA, as amended by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. businesses and their owners, including REITs and their shareholders. Changes made by the TCJA and the CARES Act that could affect us and our shareholders include:•temporarily reducing individual U.S. federal income tax rates on ordinary income; the highest individual U.S. federal income tax rate has been reduced from 39.6% to 37% for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026;•permanently eliminating the progressive corporate tax rate structure, with a maximum corporate tax rate of 35%, and replacing it with a flat corporate tax rate of 21%;•permitting a deduction for certain pass-through business income, including dividends received by our shareholders from us that are not designated by us as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income, which will generally allow individuals, trusts, and estates to deduct up to 20% of such amounts for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026;•reducing the highest rate of withholding with respect to our distributions to non-U.S. stockholders that are treated as attributable to gains from the sale or exchange of U.S. real property interests from 35% to 21%;•limiting our deduction for net operating losses to 80% of REIT taxable income (prior to the application of the dividends paid deduction) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020;•generally limiting the deduction for net business interest expense in excess of a specified percentage (50% for taxable years beginning in 2019 and 2020 and 30% for subsequent taxable years) of a business’s adjusted taxable income except for taxpayers that engage in certain real estate businesses and elect out of this rule (provided that such electing taxpayers must use an alternative depreciation system for certain property); and•eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax.You are urged to consult with your tax advisor with respect to the status of legislative, regulatory, judicial or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our securities.U.S. federal tax reform legislation could affect REITs generally, our tenants, the markets in which we operate, the price of our common stock and our results of operations, in ways, both positively and negatively, that are difficult to predict.Certain federal tax legislation more specifically described above (the “2017 Legislation”) included significant changes to corporate and individual tax rates and the calculation of taxes. As a REIT, we are generally not required to pay federal taxes otherwise applicable to regular corporations if we distribute all of our income and comply with the various tax rules governing REITs. Stockholders, however, are generally required to pay taxes on REIT dividends. The 2017 Legislation changed the way in which dividends paid on our stock are taxed by the holder of that stock and could impact the price of our common stock or how stockholders and potential investors view an investment in REITs. In addition, while certain elements of the 2017 Legislation do not impact us directly as a REIT, they could impact our tenants and the markets in which we operate in ways, both positive and negative, that are difficult to predict. 20 Prospective stockholders are urged to consult with their tax advisors with respect to the 2017 Legislation and any other regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and the potential effects thereof on an investment in our common stock.In order to preserve our REIT status, our charter limits the number of shares a person may own, which may discourage a takeover that could result in a premium price for our common stock or otherwise benefit our stockholders.Our charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our Board of Directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Unless exempted by our Board of Directors, no person may (i) own, or be deemed to own by virtue of certain constructive ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, in excess of 5.0% (in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our common stock or (ii) own, or be deemed to own by virtue of certain other constructive ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, in excess of 9.9% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding shares of our common stock, which may discourage large investors from purchasing our stock. This restriction may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all of our assets) that might provide a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders.Risks Related to Ownership of Our SecuritiesChanges in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded common stock.As with other publicly traded securities, the market price of our publicly traded common stock depends on various market conditions, which may change from time-to-time. Among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded common stock are the following: our financial condition and performance and that of our significant tenants; the market’s perception of our growth potential and potential future earnings; the reputation of REITs generally and the reputation of REITs with portfolios similar to us; the attractiveness of the securities of REITs in comparison to securities issued by other entities (including securities issued by other real estate companies); an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for publicly traded securities; the extent of institutional investor interest in us; and general economic and financial market conditions.We may change our dividend policy and the dividends we pay may be subject to significant volatility.The decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon such factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant and the dividend paid may vary from expected amounts. Any change in our dividend policy could adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock. In addition, the credit and note purchase agreements governing our borrowings prohibit the payments of dividends during certain events of default. No assurance can be given that our financial performance in the future will permit our payment of any dividends or that the amount of dividends we pay, if any, will not fluctuate significantly. Under the Maryland General Corporation Law (“MGCL”), our ability to pay dividends would be restricted if, after payment of the dividend, (i) we would not be able to pay indebtedness as it becomes due in the usual course of business or (ii) our total assets would be less than the sum of our liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if we were to be dissolved, to satisfy the rights of any stockholders with liquidation preferences. There currently are no stockholders with liquidation preferences. No assurance can be given that our financial performance in the future will permit our payment of any dividends. The credit and note purchase agreements governing our borrowings contain customary financial covenants such as availability, leverage and coverage ratios and minimum tangible net worth, as well as limitations on restricted payments, which may limit our ability to incur additional debt or pay dividends. As a result of the factors described above, we may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis, which could materially and adversely affect our business, stock price and ability to pay dividends.Future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our equity securities.Our future growth depends upon our ability to raise additional capital. If we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities, such issuance, the receipt of the net proceeds thereof and the use of such proceeds may have a dilutive effect on our expected earnings per share, funds from operations per share and adjusted funds from operations per share. The actual amount of such dilution cannot be determined at this time and will be based on numerous factors. Additionally, we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or preferred stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities in the future. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market after an offering or the perception that such sales could occur.Provisions contained in a forward sale agreement under our at-the-market equity offering program could result in substantial dilution to our earnings per share and return on equity or result in substantial cash payment obligations.21 We have previously entered into forward sale agreements and may in the future enter into additional forward sale agreements, including under our at-the-market equity offering program, that subject us to certain risks. If we enter into one or more forward sale agreements in connection with the at-the-market equity offering program, the relevant Forward Purchaser (as defined in such forward sale agreement) will have the right to accelerate its forward sale agreement (with respect to all or any portion of the transaction under such forward sale agreement that the Forward Purchaser determines is affected by an event described below) and require us to physically settle on a date specified by such Forward Purchaser if:•in such Forward Purchaser’s good faith, commercially reasonable judgment, it or its affiliate (x) is unable to hedge its exposure under such forward sale agreement because an insufficient number of shares of our common stock have been made available for borrowing by securities lenders or (y) would incur a stock loan cost in excess of a specified threshold to hedge its exposure under such forward sale agreement;•we declare any dividend, issue or distribution on shares of our common stock (a) payable in cash in excess of specified amounts (unless it is an extraordinary dividend), (b) payable in securities of another company that we acquire or own (directly or indirectly) as a result of a spin-off or similar transaction, or (c) payable in any other type of securities (other than shares of our common stock), rights, warrants or other assets for payment at less than the prevailing market price;•certain ownership thresholds applicable to such Forward Purchaser and its affiliates are exceeded;•an event is announced that if consummated would result in a specified extraordinary event (including certain mergers or tender offers, as well as certain events involving our nationalization, or insolvency, or a delisting of shares of our common stock) or the occurrence of a change in law under such forward sale agreement; or•certain other events of default or termination events occur, including, among others, any material misrepresentation made in connection with such forward sale agreement (each as more fully described in each forward sale agreement).A Forward Purchaser’s decision to exercise its right to accelerate the physical settlement of any forward sale agreement and require us to physically settle on a date specified by such Forward Purchaser will be made irrespective of our interests, including our need for capital. In such cases, we could be required to issue and deliver shares of shares of our common stock under the physical settlement provisions of the applicable forward sale agreement, irrespective of our capital needs, which would result in dilution to our earnings per share and return on equity.We expect that settlement of any forward sale agreement will generally occur no later than the date specified in the particular forward sale agreement, which will be no earlier than three months or later than two years following the trade date of that forward sale agreement. However, any forward sale agreement may be settled earlier than that specified date in whole or in part at our option. Subject to certain conditions, we have the right to elect physical, cash or net share settlement under each forward sale agreement. We intend to physically settle each forward sale agreement by delivery of shares of our common stock. However, we may elect to cash settle or net share settle such forward sale agreement. Delivery of shares of our common stock upon physical settlement (or, if we elect net share settlement of a particular forward sale agreement, upon such settlement to the extent we are obligated to deliver shares of our common stock) will result in dilution to our earnings per share and return on equity. If we elect cash settlement or net share settlement with respect to all or a portion of the shares of common stock underlying a particular forward sale agreement, we expect the applicable Forward Purchaser (or an affiliate thereof) to purchase a number of shares of our common stock in secondary market transactions over an unwind period to:•return shares of our common stock to securities lenders in order to unwind such Forward Purchaser’s hedge (after taking into consideration any shares of our common stock to be delivered by us to such Forward Purchaser, in the case of net share settlement); and•if applicable, in the case of net share settlement, deliver shares of our common stock to us to the extent required in settlement of such forward sale agreement.The purchase of shares of our common stock in connection with a Forward Purchaser or its affiliate unwinding such Forward Purchaser’s hedge positions could cause the price of shares of our common stock to increase over such time (or prevent a decrease over such time), thereby increasing the amount of cash we would owe to such Forward Purchaser (or decreasing the amount of cash that such Forward Purchaser would owe to us) upon a cash settlement of the relevant forward sale agreement or increasing the number of shares of our common stock we would deliver to such Forward Purchaser (or decreasing the number of shares of our common stock that such Forward Purchaser would deliver to us) upon net share settlement of the relevant forward sale agreement.The forward sale price that we expect to receive upon physical settlement of a particular forward sale agreement will be subject to adjustment on a daily basis based on a floating interest rate factor equal to the overnight bank rate less a spread and will be decreased based on amounts related to expected dividends on shares of our common stock during the term of the applicable forward sale agreement. If the overnight bank rate is less than the spread for a particular forward sale agreement on any day, the interest factor will result in a daily reduction of the applicable forward sale price. If the volume-weighted average price at which a particular Forward Purchaser (or its affiliate) is able to purchase (or is deemed able to purchase) shares during the applicable unwind period under a particular forward 22 sale agreement is above the relevant forward sale price, in the case of cash settlement, we would pay the relevant Forward Purchaser under such forward sale agreement an amount in cash equal to the difference or, in the case of net share settlement, we would deliver to such Forward Purchaser a number of shares of our common stock having a value equal to the difference. Thus, we could be responsible for a potentially substantial cash payment in the case of cash settlement. If the volume-weighted average price at which a particular Forward Purchaser (or its affiliate) is able to purchase (or is deemed able to purchase) shares during the applicable unwind period under that particular forward sale agreement is below the relevant forward sale price, in the case of cash settlement, we would be paid the difference in cash by the relevant Forward Purchaser under that particular forward sale agreement or, in the case of net share settlement, we would receive from such Forward Purchaser a number of shares of our common stock having a value equal to the difference. In case of our bankruptcy or insolvency, any forward sale agreement under our at-the-market equity offering program that is in effect will automatically terminate, and we would not receive the expected proceeds from any forward sales of shares of our common stock.If we or a regulatory authority with jurisdiction over us institutes, or we consent to, a proceeding seeking a judgment in bankruptcy or insolvency or any other relief under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or other similar law affecting creditors’ rights, or we or a regulatory authority with jurisdiction over us presents a petition for our winding-up or liquidation, or we consent to such a petition, any forward sale agreement that is then in effect will automatically terminate. If any such forward sale agreement so terminates under these circumstances, we would not be obligated to deliver to the relevant Forward Purchaser any shares of common stock not previously delivered, and the relevant Forward Purchaser would be discharged from its obligation to pay the applicable forward sale price per share in respect of any shares of common stock not previously settled under the applicable forward sale agreement. Therefore, to the extent that there are any shares of common stock with respect to which any forward sale agreement has not been settled at the time of the commencement of any such bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, we would not receive the relevant forward sale price per share in respect of those shares of common stock.Maryland law may discourage a third-party from acquiring us.We are subject to the provisions of the Maryland Business Combination Act (the “Business Combination Act”) which prohibits transactions between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Generally, pursuant to the Business Combination Act, an “interested stockholder” is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of a Maryland corporation’s voting stock. These provisions could have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of our Company or reducing the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our capital stock. Additionally, the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act may deny voting rights to shares involved in an acquisition of one-tenth or more of the voting stock of a Maryland corporation. In our charter and bylaws, we have elected not to have the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act apply to any acquisition by any person of shares of stock of our Company. However, in the case of the control share acquisition statute, our Board of Directors may opt to make this statute applicable to us at any time by amending our bylaws, and may do so on a retroactive basis. Finally, the “unsolicited takeovers” provisions of the MGCL permit our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to implement certain provisions that may have the effect of inhibiting a third-party from making an acquisition proposal for our Company or of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our Company under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price or that stockholders may otherwise believe is in their best interests; however, on February 23, 2022, our Board of Directors adopted a resolution prohibiting us from electing to be subject to the classified board provisions of Section 3-803 of the MGCL, unless such election is first approved by the stockholders of the Corporation by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast on the matter by stockholders entitled to vote generally in the election of directors"

We are subject to various risks, many of which are beyond our control. As a result of these and other factors, we may experience material fluctuations in our future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. An investment in our stock involves various risks, including those mentioned below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and those that are described from time to time in our other filings with the SEC.Summary of Risk Factors
Our business is subject to risks and uncertainties, including those risks and uncertainties discussed at-length below, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following:Risks Related to Our Business and Operations•The risks inherent in owning or leasing real estate. •The real estate industry is highly competitive. •Our future cash flow is dependent on the performance of our tenants of their lease obligations, renewal of existing leases and either re-leasing or selling our properties.•Significant number of our tenants depend on the same industry for their revenues. •It may be difficult for our investors to determine the creditworthiness of our tenants.•An increase in costs and liability accruals as a result of environmental laws and regulations could adversely affect our business. •We are defending pending lawsuits and claims that may subject us to material losses. •We may be subject to losses that may not be covered by insurance. •The concentration of a significant number of our properties in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, and adverse conditions in those regions, in particular, could negatively impact our operations.•Property taxes on our properties may increase without notice. •Our business operations may not generate sufficient cash for distributions or debt service.•Adverse developments in general business, economic or political conditions could have a material adverse effect on us.•Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the market on which our common stock trades, the markets in which we operate, our operations and our results of operations (including the escalating conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the related impact on macroeconomic conditions as a result of such conflict).•Our exposure to counterparty risk.9 •Inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.•Our assets may be subject to impairment charges. •Our accounting policies and methods require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain.•Amendments to the Accounting Standards Codification made by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) or changes in accounting standards may adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability or financial position.•If we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately and timely report our financial results.•Our reliance on certain members of our management team or Board of Directors, the loss of any one of which could adversely affect our business or the market price of our common stock. •Our reliance on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business.•Our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be impacted by the continued presence of COVID-19.Risks Related to Financing Our Business•Our dependency on external sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. •Interest rate risk and our ability to manage or mitigate this risk effectively. •Adverse effects by the transition from LIBOR.Risks Related to Our Investment Strategy•We may not be able to successfully implement our investment strategy. •We expect to acquire new properties and this may create risks. •We are pursuing redevelopment opportunities and this creates risks to our Company. Risks Related to Our Status as a REIT•The failure to qualify as a REIT under the federal income tax laws would have adverse consequences to our stockholders. Uncertain tax matters may have a significant impact on the results of operations for any single fiscal year or interim period or may cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT.•The uncertainty regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the cash that we might receive from cash settlement of a forward sale agreement under our ATM Program could jeopardize our ability to meet the REIT qualification requirements.•A risk of changes in the tax law applicable to REITs.•U.S. federal tax reform legislation could affect REITs generally, our tenants, the markets in which we operate, the price of our common stock and our results of operations.•In order to preserve our REIT status, our charter limits the number of shares a person may own, which may discourage a takeover that could result in a premium price for our common stock or otherwise benefit our stockholders.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Securities•Changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded common stock.•Changes in our dividend policy and the dividends we pay may be subject to significant volatility.•Our forward sale agreement under our ATM Program could result in substantial dilution to our earnings per share and return on equity or result in substantial cash payment obligations.•In case of our bankruptcy or insolvency, any forward sale agreement that is in effect under our ATM Program will automatically terminate, and we would not receive the expected proceeds.•Future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our equity securities.•Maryland law may discourage a third-party from acquiring us.10 Risks Related to Our Business and OperationsWe are subject to risks inherent in owning and leasing real estate.We are subject to varying degrees of risk generally related to leasing and owning real estate, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to general risks applicable to us, our risks include, among others: our liability as a lessee for long-term lease obligations regardless of our revenues; deterioration in national, regional and local economic and real estate market conditions; potential changes in supply of, or demand for, rental properties similar to ours; competition for tenants and declining rental rates; difficulty in selling or re-leasing properties on favorable terms or at all; impairments in our ability to collect rent or other payments due to us when they are due; increases in interest rates and adverse changes in the availability, cost and terms of financing; uninsured property liability; the impact of present or future environmental legislation and compliance with environmental laws; adverse changes in zoning laws and other regulations; acts of terrorism and war; acts of God; the unforeseen impacts of climate change, compliance with any future laws or regulations designed to prevent or mitigate the impacts of climate change, and any material costs related thereto; the potential risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time the need to periodically renovate and repair our properties; and physical or weather-related damage to our properties. Certain significant expenditures generally do not change in response to economic or other conditions, including: (i) debt service, (ii) real estate taxes, (iii) environmental remediation costs and (iv) operating and maintenance costs. The combination of variable revenue and relatively fixed expenditures may result, under certain market conditions, in reduced earnings and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.Each of the factors listed above could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. In addition, real estate investments are relatively illiquid, which means that our ability to vary our portfolio of properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be limited.We are in a competitive business.The real estate industry is highly competitive. Where we own properties, we compete for tenants with a large number of real estate property owners and other companies that sublet properties. Our principal means of competition are rents we are able to charge in relation to the income producing potential of the location. In addition, we expect other major real estate investors, some with much greater financial resources or more experienced personnel than we have, will compete with us for attractive acquisition opportunities. These competitors include petroleum manufacturing, distributing and marketing companies, convenience store retailers, other REITs, public and private investment funds, and other individual and institutional investors. This competition has increased prices for properties we seek to acquire and may impair our ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms in the future.Our future cash flow is dependent on the performance of our tenants of their lease obligations, renewal of existing leases and either re-leasing or selling our properties.We are subject to risks that financial distress, default or bankruptcy of our tenants may lead to vacancy at our properties or disruption in rent receipts as a result of partial payment or nonpayment of rent or that expiring leases may not be renewed. Under unfavorable general economic conditions, there can be no assurance that our tenants’ level of sales and financial performance generally will not be adversely affected, which in turn could negatively impact our rental revenues. We are subject to risks that the terms governing renewal or re-leasing of our properties (including, compliance with numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment, such as the remediation of contamination and the retirement and decommissioning or removal of long-lived assets, the cost of required renovations, or replacement of USTs and related equipment) may be less favorable than current lease terms.We are also subject to the risk that we may receive less net proceeds from the properties we sell as compared to their current carrying value or that the value of our properties may be adversely affected by unfavorable general economic conditions. Unfavorable general economic conditions may also negatively impact our ability to re-lease or sell our properties. Numerous properties compete with our properties in attracting tenants to lease space. The number of available or competitive properties in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease or sell our properties and on the rents we are able to charge. In addition to the risk of disruption in rent receipts, we are subject to the risk of incurring real estate taxes, maintenance, environmental and other expenses at vacant properties. The financial distress, default or bankruptcy of our tenants may also lead to protracted and expensive processes for retaking control of our properties than would otherwise be the case, including, eviction or other legal proceedings related to or resulting from the tenant’s default. These risks are greater with respect to certain of our tenants who lease multiple properties from us. If a tenant files for bankruptcy protection it is possible that we would recover substantially less than the full value of our claims against the tenant. If (i) our tenants do not perform their lease obligations, (ii) we are unable to renew existing leases and promptly recapture and re-lease or sell our properties, (iii) lease terms upon renewal or re-leasing are less favorable than current or historical lease terms, (iv) the values of properties that we sell are adversely affected by market conditions, or (v) we incur significant costs or disruption related to or resulting from tenant financial distress, default or bankruptcy, then our cash flow could be significantly adversely affected.11 Significant number of our tenants depend on the same industry for their revenues. We derive significant portion of our revenues from leasing, primarily on a triple-net basis, and financing convenience store and gasoline station properties to tenants in the petroleum marketing industry. Accordingly, significant portion of our revenues depend on the economic success of the petroleum marketing industry, and any factors that adversely affect that industry, such as disruption in the supply of petroleum or a decrease in the demand for conventional motor fuels due to conservation, technological advancements in petroleum-fueled motor vehicles or an increase in the use of, and consumer demand for, alternative fuel, electric and battery-operated vehicles, or other “green technologies,” could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. Similarly, governmental regulations regarding climate change and the greenhouse gas emissions may accelerate these trends that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. The success of participants in the petroleum marketing industry depends upon the sale of refined petroleum products at margins in excess of fixed and variable expenses. The petroleum marketing industry is highly competitive and volatile. Petroleum products are commodities, the prices of which depend on numerous factors that affect supply and demand. The prices paid by our tenants and other petroleum marketers for products are affected by global, national and regional factors. A large, rapid increase in wholesale petroleum prices would adversely affect the profitability and cash flows of our tenants if the increased cost of petroleum products could not be passed on to their customers or if automobile consumption of gasoline was to decline significantly. We cannot be certain as to how these factors will affect petroleum product prices or supply in the future, or how in particular they will affect our tenants.Because certain of our tenants are not rated and their financial information is not available to you, it may be difficult for our investors to determine their creditworthiness.The majority of our properties are leased to tenants who are not rated by any nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. In addition, our tenants’ financial information is not generally available to our investors. Additionally, many of our tenants are part of larger corporate organizations and we do not receive financial information for the other entities in those organizations. The financial distress of other affiliated companies or businesses in those organizations may negatively impact the ability or willingness of our tenant to perform its obligations under its lease with us. Because of the lack of financial information or credit ratings it is, therefore, difficult for our investors to assess the creditworthiness of our tenants and to determine the ability of our tenants to meet their obligations to us. It is possible that the assumptions and estimates we make after reviewing publicly and privately obtained information about our tenants are not accurate and that we may be required to increase reserves for bad debts, record allowances for deferred rent receivable or record additional expenses if our tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations to us.We incur significant operating costs and, from time to time, may have significant liability accruals as a result of environmental laws and regulations, which costs and accruals could significantly increase, and reduce our profitability or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, including matters relating to the protection of the environment. Under certain environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at, on, or under, such property, and may be required to investigate and clean-up such contamination. Such laws typically impose liability and clean-up responsibility first on the party responsible for the contamination, but can also impose liability and clean-up responsibility on the owner and the current operator without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants, or the timing or cause of the contamination. Liability under such environmental laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility and the financial resources are available to perform the remediation. For example, liability may arise as a result of the historical use of a property or from the migration of contamination from adjacent or nearby properties. Any such contamination or liability may also reduce the value of the property. In addition, the owner or operator of a property may be subject to claims by third-parties based on injury, damage and/or costs, including investigation and clean-up costs, resulting from environmental contamination present at or emanating from a property. We cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations may be enacted in the future, or how existing laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted with respect to products or activities to which they have not previously been applied. Additionally, compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of the regulatory agencies or stricter interpretation of existing laws, which may develop in the future, could have an adverse effect on our financial position, or that of our tenants, and could require substantial additional expenditures for future remediation. Accordingly, compliance with environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.The majority of the properties owned or controlled by us are leased as convenience store and gasoline station properties, and therefore may contain, or may have contained, USTs for the storage of petroleum products and other hazardous or toxic substances, which creates a potential for the release of such products or substances. Some of our properties are subject to regulations regarding the retirement and decommissioning or removal of long-lived assets including buildings containing hazardous materials, USTs and other equipment. Some of the properties may be adjacent to or near properties that have contained or currently contain USTs used to store petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, certain of the properties are on, adjacent to, or near properties 12 upon which others have engaged or may in the future engage in activities that may release petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. There may be other environmental problems associated with our properties of which we are unaware. These problems may make it more difficult for us to re-lease or sell our properties on favorable terms, or at all.We enter into leases and various other agreements which contractually allocate responsibility between the parties for known and unknown environmental liabilities at or relating to the subject properties. Under applicable laws, we are contingently liable for these environmental obligations in the event that our tenant does not satisfy them, and we are required to accrue for environmental liabilities that we believe are allocable to others under our leases if we determine that it is probable that our tenant will not meet its environmental obligations. It is possible that our assumptions regarding the ultimate allocation method and share of responsibility that we used to allocate environmental liabilities may change, which may result in material adjustments to the amounts recorded for environmental litigation accruals and environmental remediation liabilities. We assess whether to accrue for environmental liabilities based upon relevant factors including our tenants’ histories of paying for such obligations, our assessment of their financial capability, and their intent to pay for such obligations. However, there can be no assurance that our assessments are correct or that our tenants who have paid their obligations in the past will continue to do so. We may ultimately be responsible to pay for environmental liabilities as the property owner if our tenant fails to pay them. The ultimate resolution of these matters could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.For substantially all of our triple-net leases, our tenants are contractually responsible for compliance with environmental laws and regulations, removal of USTs at the end of their lease term (the cost of which in certain cases is partially borne by us) and remediation of any environmental contamination that arises during the term of their tenancy. Under the terms of our leases covering properties previously leased to Marketing (substantially all of which commenced in 2012), we agreed to be responsible for environmental contamination at the premises that was known at the time the lease commenced, and for environmental contamination which existed prior to commencement of the lease and is discovered (other than as a result of a voluntary site investigation) during the first 10 years of the lease term (or a shorter period for a minority of such leases). Substantially all of these 10-year (or, in certain cases, shorter) “look back” periods have now expired, therefore responsibility for all newly discovered contamination, even if it relates to periods prior to commencement of these leases, is contractually allocated to our tenant. Our tenants at properties previously leased to Marketing are in all cases contractually responsible for the cost of any remediation of contamination that results from their use and occupancy of our properties. Under substantially all of our other triple-net leases  (i.e., leases covering properties not previously leased to Marketing), contractual responsibility for remediation of all environmental contamination discovered during the term of the lease (including known and unknown contamination that existed prior to commencement of the lease) is the responsibility of our tenant.For additional information regarding pending environmental lawsuits and claims, and environmental remediation obligations and estimates, see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings”, “Environmental Matters” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Notes 3 and 5 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K.Environmental exposures are difficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons, including the amount of data available upon initial assessment of contamination, alternative treatment methods that may be applied, location of the property which subjects it to differing local laws and regulations and their interpretations, changes in costs associated with environmental remediation services and equipment, the availability of state UST remediation funds and the possibility of existing legal claims giving rise to allocation of responsibilities to others, as well as the time it takes to remediate contamination and receive regulatory approval. In developing our liability for estimated environmental remediation obligations on a property by property basis, we consider, among other things, laws and regulations, assessments of contamination and surrounding geology, quality of information available, currently available technologies for treatment, alternative methods of remediation and prior experience. Environmental accruals are based on estimates derived upon facts known to us at this time, which are subject to significant change as circumstances change, and as environmental contingencies become more clearly defined and reasonably estimable.We cannot predict if state UST fund programs will be administered and funded in the future in a manner that is consistent with past practices and if future environmental spending will continue to be eligible for reimbursement at historical recovery rates under these programs. As a result, our estimates in respect of recoveries from state UST remediation funds could change, which could adversely affect our accruals for environmental remediation liabilities.Any changes to our estimates or our assumptions that form the basis of our estimates may result in our providing an accrual, or adjustments to the amounts recorded, for environmental remediation liabilities. Additional environmental liabilities could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.We are defending pending lawsuits and claims and are subject to material losses.We are subject to various lawsuits and claims, including litigation related to environmental matters, such as those arising from leaking USTs, contamination of groundwater with methyl tertiary butyl ether (a fuel derived from methanol, commonly referred to as “MTBE”) and releases of motor fuel into the environment, and toxic tort claims. The ultimate resolution of certain matters cannot be predicted because considerable uncertainty exists both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimate of such loss. Our ultimate liabilities resulting from the lawsuits and claims we face could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, 13 results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. For additional information with respect to certain pending lawsuits and claims, see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” and Note 3 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K.We are subject to losses that may not be covered by insurance.We and our tenants carry insurance against certain risks and in such amounts as we believe are customary for businesses of our kind. However, as the costs and availability of insurance change, we may decide not to be covered against certain losses (such as certain environmental liabilities, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and civil disorder) where, in the judgment of management, the insurance is not warranted due to cost or availability of coverage or the remoteness of perceived risk. Furthermore, there are certain types of losses, such as losses resulting from wars, terrorism or certain acts of God, that generally are not insured because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. There is no assurance that the existing insurance coverages are or will be sufficient to cover actual losses incurred. The destruction of, or significant damage to, or significant liabilities arising out of conditions at, our properties due to an uninsured loss would result in an economic loss and could result in us losing both our investment in, and anticipated profits from, such properties. When a loss is insured, the coverage may be insufficient in amount or duration, or a lessee’s customers may be lost, such that the lessee cannot resume its business after the loss at prior levels or at all, resulting in reduced rent or a default under its lease. Any such loss relating to a large number of properties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.A significant portion of our properties are concentrated in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, and adverse conditions in those regions, in particular, could negatively impact our operations.A significant portion of the properties we own and lease are located in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States and, as of December 31, 2022, 34.4% of our annual base rent is derived from four states (New York, Massachusetts, Maryland, and Connecticut). Because of the concentration of our properties in those regions, in the event of adverse economic conditions in those regions, we would likely experience higher risk of default on payment of rent to us than if our properties were more geographically diversified. Additionally, the rents on our properties may be subject to a greater risk of default than other properties in the event of adverse economic, political or business developments, natural disasters or severe weather that may affect the Northeast or Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States and the ability of our lessees to make rent payments. This lack of geographical diversification could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.Property taxes on our properties may increase without notice.Each of the properties we own or lease is subject to real property taxes. The leases for certain of the properties that we lease from third-parties obligate us to pay real property taxes with regard to those properties. The real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we acquire or lease in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities. To the extent that our tenants are unable or unwilling to pay such increase in accordance with their leases, our net operating expenses may increase.Our business operations may not generate sufficient cash for distributions or debt service.There is no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay dividends on our common stock, to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may not be able to repay or refinance existing indebtedness on favorable terms, which could force us to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms (which may also result in losses) or accept financing on unfavorable terms.Adverse developments in general business, economic or political conditions could have a material adverse effect on us.Adverse developments in general business and economic conditions, including through recession, downturn or otherwise, either in the economy generally or in those regions in which a large portion of our business is conducted, could have a material adverse effect on us and significantly increase certain of the risks we are subject to. Among other effects, adverse economic conditions could depress real estate values, impact our ability to re-lease or sell our properties and have an adverse effect on our tenants’ level of sales and financial performance generally. As our revenues are substantially dependent on the economic success of our tenants, any factors that adversely impact our tenants could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the market on which our common stock trades, the markets in which we operate, our operations and our results of operations.Terrorist attacks or other acts of violence or war could negatively affect our business or the businesses of our tenants. These attacks may directly or indirectly impact the physical facilities, networks or the business or the financial condition of us or those of our tenants, vendors or financial institutions with which we have a relationship or conduct business. The consequences of armed conflicts are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. More generally, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States and worldwide financial markets and economy. Terrorist attacks also could be a factor resulting in, or which could exacerbate, an economic recession 14 in the United States or abroad. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.We are exposed to counterparty risk and there can be no assurances that we will effectively manage or mitigate this risk.We regularly interact with counterparties in various industries. The types of counterparties most common to our transactions and agreements include, but are not limited to, landlords, tenants, vendors and lenders. We also enter into agreements to acquire and sell properties which allocate responsibility for certain costs to the counterparty. Our most significant counterparties include, but are not limited to, the members of the bank syndicate related to our to our Second Restated Credit Agreement, the lenders that are the counterparties to our senior unsecured notes and our major tenants from whom we derive a significant amount of rental revenue. The default, insolvency or other inability or unwillingness of a significant counterparty to perform its obligations under an agreement, including, without limitation, as a result of the rejection of an agreement in bankruptcy proceedings, is likely to have a material adverse effect on us. As of December 31, 2022, we leased:•150 properties in three separate unitary leases and two stand-alone leases to subsidiaries of Global which represented, in the aggregate, 16% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.•128 properties in four separate unitary leases to subsidiaries of Arko which represented, in the aggregate, 14% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.•78 properties in three separate unitary leases and one stand-alone lease to United Oil which, in the aggregate, represented 11% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. We may also undertake additional transactions with these or other existing tenants, which would further concentrate our sources of rental revenues. Many of our tenants, including those noted above, are part of larger corporate organizations and the financial distress of one subsidiary or other affiliated companies or businesses in those organizations may negatively impact the ability or willingness of our tenant to perform its obligations under its lease with us. The failure of a major tenant or their default in their rental and other obligations to us is likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.Inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Although inflation has not materially impacted our results of operations in the recent past, increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations. During times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, as provided for in our leases, rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation. Likewise, even though our triple-net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation, substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue, which may adversely affect our tenants’ ability to pay rent.Also, during inflationary periods, interest rates have historically increased, which would have a direct effect on the interest expense of our borrowings. Our exposure to increases in interest rates in the short term is limited to our variable-rate borrowings, which consist of borrowings under our Revolving Facility. Additionally, inflationary pricing may have a negative effect on the real estate acquisitions and construction costs necessary to complete our development and redevelopment projects, including, but not limited to, costs of construction materials, labor, and services from third-party contractors and suppliers. Higher acquisition and construction costs could adversely impact our net investments in real estate and expected yields on our development and redevelopment projects, which may make otherwise lucrative investment opportunities less profitable to us. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, as well as our ability to pay dividends, could be adversely affected over time.Our assets may be subject to impairment charges.We periodically evaluate our real estate investments and other assets for impairment indicators. The judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (”GAAP”), and includes a variety of factors such as market conditions, the accumulation of asset retirement costs due to changes in estimates associated with our estimated environmental liabilities, the status of significant leases, the financial condition of major tenants, and other assumptions and factors that could affect the cash flow from or fair value of our properties. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we incurred $3.5 million and $4.4 million, respectively, of impairment charges. We may be required to take similar impairment charges, which could affect the implementation of our current business strategy and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.15 Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial position and results of operations, and they require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain.Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial position and results of operations. We have identified several accounting policies as being critical to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations because they require management to make particularly subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be recorded under different conditions or using different assumptions. We cannot provide any assurance that we will not make subsequent significant adjustments to our consolidated financial statements. Estimates, judgments and assumptions underlying our consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, receivables and related reserves, deferred rent receivable, income under direct financing leases, asset retirement obligations (including environmental remediation obligations and future environmental liabilities for pre-existing unknown environmental contamination), real estate, depreciation and amortization, carrying value of our properties, impairment of long-lived assets, litigation, accrued liabilities, income taxes and allocation of the purchase price of properties acquired to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If our accounting policies, methods, judgments, assumptions, estimates and allocations prove to be incorrect, or if circumstances change, our business, financial condition, revenues, operating expense, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price may be materially adversely affected.Amendments to the Accounting Standards Codification made by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) or changes in accounting standards issued by other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability or financial position.Our consolidated financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification, which is periodically amended by the FASB. The application of GAAP is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, we are required to adopt amendments to the Accounting Standards Codification or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time-to-time by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB and the SEC. Those changes could adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability or financial position.If we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately and timely report our financial results.Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, effectively prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. We are required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.As a result of material weaknesses or significant deficiencies that may be identified in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may also identify certain deficiencies in some of our disclosure controls and procedures that we believe require remediation. If we or our independent registered public accounting firm discover any such weaknesses or deficiencies, we will make efforts to further improve our internal control over financial reporting controls. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful. Any failure to maintain effective controls or timely effect any necessary improvement of our internal control over financial reporting controls could harm operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, which could affect the listing of our common stock on the NYSE. Ineffective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the per share trading price of our common stock.The loss of certain members of our management team or Board of Directors could adversely affect our business or the market price of our common stock.Our future success and ability to implement our business and investment strategy depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key management personnel and directors, and on the continued contributions of such persons, each of whom may be difficult to replace. As a REIT, we employ only 32 employees and have a cost-effective management structure. We do not have any employment agreements with any of our executives. In the event of the loss of key management personnel or directors, or upon unexpected death, disability or retirement, we may not be able to find replacements with comparable skill, ability and industry expertise, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. Additionally, certain of our directors beneficially own more than 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If any of these directors cease to be a director of the Company and they or their estate sell a significant portion of such holdings into the public market, it could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.16 We rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business. Additionally, our failure to comply with applicable privacy, data security or protection or cyber security laws could adversely affect our business.We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, including financial transactions and maintenance of records, which may include personal identifying information of tenants and lease data. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting and storing confidential tenant information, such as individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts. Although we have taken steps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems, it is possible that our security measures will not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning, or the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber attacks. Security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, whether of our systems or those of our vendors or other third parties who hold or have access to our information, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Any failure by us, or our vendors or other third parties who hold or have access to our information to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect us.Governments are continuing to focus on privacy, cybersecurity, data protection and data security and it is possible that new privacy or data security laws will be passed or existing laws will be amended in a way that is material to our business. Any significant change to applicable laws, regulations, or industry practices regarding our employees’ and users’ data could require us to modify our business, services and products features, possibly in a material manner, and may limit our ability to develop new products, services, and features. Although we have made efforts to design our policies, procedures, and systems to comply with the current requirements of applicable state, federal, and foreign laws, changes to applicable laws and regulations in this area could subject us to additional regulation and oversight, any of which could significantly increase our operating costs.Our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be impacted by the continued presence of COVID-19 and such impact could be materially adverse.The global spread of COVID-19 created significant volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption. The extent to which the continued presence of COVID-19 impacts our business, operations and financial results is uncertain, and will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including governmental, business, and individual actions taken in response to COVID-19 and the impact of those actions on global economic activity; the actions taken in response to economic disruption; the reduced economic activity, if not closures from time to time of our tenants’ facilities, may impact our tenants' businesses, financial condition and liquidity, and may cause one or more of our tenants to be unable to meet their obligations to us in full, or at all, or to otherwise seek modifications of such obligations; general decline in business activity and demand for real estate transactions could adversely affect our ability or desire to grow our portfolio of properties; the financial impact of COVID-19 could negatively impact our future compliance with financial covenants of our Second Restated Credit Agreement and our senior unsecured notes and result in a default and potentially an acceleration of indebtedness, which non-compliance could negatively impact our ability to make additional borrowings under our Revolving Facility and pay dividends; and a deterioration in our or our tenants’ ability to operate in affected areas or delays in the supply of products or services to us or our tenants from vendors that are needed for our or our tenants’ efficient operations could adversely affect our operations and those of our tenants.The fluidity of this situation precludes any prediction as to the full adverse impact of COVID-19 . Nevertheless, the COVID-19 continues to present uncertainty and risk with respect to our performance, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and performance. Moreover, many risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, should be interpreted as heightened risks as a result of the impact of COVID-19.Risks Related to Financing Our BusinessWe are dependent on external sources of capital which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.We are dependent on external sources of capital to maintain our status as a REIT and must distribute to our stockholders each year at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding any net capital gain. Because of these distribution requirements, it is not likely that we will be able to fund all future capital needs, including acquisitions, from income from operations. Therefore, we will have to continue to rely on third-party sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. We may need to access the capital markets in order to execute future significant acquisitions. There can be no assurance that sources of capital will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.Our principal sources of liquidity are the cash flows from our operations, funds available under our Second Restated Credit Agreement, proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock through offerings, from time to time, under our ATM Program, pursuant to which we may also sell shares of common stock under forward sale agreements, and available cash and cash equivalents. In 2021, pursuant to the Second Restated Credit Agreement, we (i) extended the maturity date of the Revolving Facility from March 2022 to October 2025, (ii) reduced the interest rate for borrowings under the Revolving Facility and (iii) amended certain financial covenants and other provisions. The Second Restated Credit Agreement provides for the Revolving Facility in an aggregate principal amount of 17 $300.0 million and includes an accordion feature to increase the revolving commitments or add one or more tranches of term loans up to an additional aggregate amount not to exceed $300.0 million, subject to certain conditions, including one or more new or existing lenders agreeing to provide commitments for such increased amount and that no default or event of default shall have occurred and be continuing under the terms of the Revolving Facility. As of December 31, 2022, we have also issued $625.0 million of senior unsecured notes. For additional information, see “Credit Agreement” and “Senior Unsecured Notes” in Note 4 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K.The Second Restated Credit Agreement and our senior unsecured notes contain customary financial covenants such as leverage, coverage ratios and minimum tangible net worth, as well as limitations on restricted payments, which may limit our ability to incur additional debt or pay dividends. The Second Restated Credit Agreement and our senior unsecured notes also contain customary events of default, including cross defaults to each other, change of control and failure to maintain REIT status (provided that the senior unsecured notes require a mandatory offer to prepay the notes upon a change in control in lieu of a change of control event of default). Our ability to meet the terms of the agreements is dependent upon our continued ability to meet certain criteria, as further described in Note 4 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K, the performance of our tenants and the other risks described in this section. If we are not in compliance with one or more of our covenants, which could result in an event of default under our Second Restated Credit Agreement or our senior unsecured notes, there can be no assurance that our lenders would waive such non-compliance. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.Under our ATM Program, we may issue and sell shares of our common stock with an aggregate sales price of up to $250.0 million through a consortium of banks acting as agents. Sales of shares of our common stock under our ATM Program may be made from time to time in at-the-market offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, including by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or as otherwise agreed to with the applicable agent. Sales of shares of our common stock under our ATM Program, if any, will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including among others, market conditions and the trading price of our common stock. Our agents are not required to sell any specific number or dollar amount of our common stock, but each agent will use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices and applicable law and regulation to sell shares designated by us in accordance with the terms of the distribution agreement with our agents. The net proceeds we receive will be the gross proceeds received from such sales less the commissions and any other costs we may incur in issuing the shares of our common stock. In connection with the expansion of the ATM Program in 2021, we may also sell shares of common stock under forward sale agreements. The use of a forward sale agreement allows us to lock in a price on the sale of shares of common stock at the time the agreement is executed, but defer receiving the proceeds from the sale until a later date. We may use a portion of the net proceeds from any of such sales to reduce our outstanding indebtedness, including borrowings under our Revolving Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility includes lenders who are affiliates of our agents and may be affiliates of our forward sellers and/or forward purchasers. As a result, a portion of the net proceeds from any sale of shares of our common stock under our ATM Program that is used to repay amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility will be received by these affiliates. Because an affiliate may receive a portion of the net proceeds from any of these sales, each of our agents may have an interest in these sales beyond the sales commission it will receive. This could result in a conflict of interest and cause such agents to act in a manner that is not in the best interests of us or our investors in connection with any sale of shares of our common stock under our ATM Program.Our access to third-party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors including general market conditions, the market’s perception of our growth potential, financial stability, our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions, covenants and limitations imposed under our Second Restated Credit Agreement and our senior unsecured notes, and the market price of our common stock.We are exposed to interest rate risk and there can be no assurances that we will manage or mitigate this risk effectively.We are exposed to interest rate risk, primarily as a result of our Second Restated Credit Agreement. Borrowings under our Second Restated Credit Agreement bear interest at a floating rate. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates will increase the amount of interest we must pay under our Second Restated Credit Agreement. Our interest rate risk may materially change in the future if we increase our borrowings under the Second Restated Credit Agreement or amend our Second Restated Credit Agreement or our senior unsecured notes, seek other sources of debt or equity capital or refinance our outstanding indebtedness. A significant increase in interest rates could also make it more difficult to find alternative financing on desirable terms. For additional information with respect to interest rate risk, see “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in this Form 10-K.We may be adversely affected by the transition from LIBOR.On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York convened the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (“ARRC”), a steering committee comprised 18 of large U.S. financial institutions, to identify an alternative reference rate. ARRC identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), calculated by reference to short-term repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasury securities, as the recommended alternative reference rate for USD-LIBOR in derivative and other financial contracts and proposed a paced transition plan to transition USD-LIBOR to SOFR. The first publication of SOFR was released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in April 2018. In November 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (the administrator of LIBOR) announced that it would consult on its intention to cease the publication of the one-week and two-month USD-LIBOR tenors only on December 31, 2021 and all other USD-LIBOR tenors on June 30, 2023. On March 5, 2021, the IBA issued a statement, based on such consultation, announcing that the IBA shall cease publication of the respective USD-LIBOR tenors immediately after the foregoing dates and the FCA issued a statement that it has no intention to use its proposed powers to compel the IBA to publish any of the foregoing USD-LIBOR tenors and that such USD-LIBOR tenors shall no longer be representative after such dates. The Revolving Facility includes customary LIBOR transition language that addresses the succession of LIBOR at a future date.	On December 22, 2022, we entered into an amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to transition the applicable interest rates and default rate thereunder from LIBOR-based rates to SOFR-based rates. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2022, we had no borrowings based on LIBOR. The consequences of these developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted and span multiple future periods but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate debt, which may be detrimental to our financial position or operating results.Risks Related to Our Investment StrategyWe may not be able to successfully implement our investment strategy.We may not be able to successfully implement our investment strategy. We cannot assure that our portfolio of properties will expand at all, or if it will expand at any specified rate or to any specified size. As part of our overall growth strategy, we regularly review acquisition, financing and redevelopment opportunities, and we expect to continue to pursue investments that we believe will benefit our financial performance. We cannot assure that investment opportunities which meet our investment criteria will be available. Pursuing our investment opportunities may result in additional debt or new equity issuances, that may initially be dilutive to our net income, and such investments may not perform as we expect or produce the returns that we anticipate (including, without limitation, as a result of tenant bankruptcies, tenant concessions, our inability to collect rents and higher than anticipated operating expenses). Further, we may not be able to successfully integrate investments into our existing portfolio without operating disruptions or unanticipated costs. To the extent that our current sources of liquidity are not sufficient to fund such investments, we will require other sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Additionally, to the extent that we increase the size of our portfolio, we may not be able to adapt our management, administrative, accounting and operational systems, or hire and retain sufficient operational staff to integrate investments into our portfolio or manage any future investments without operating disruptions or unanticipated costs. Moreover, our continued growth will require increased investment in management personnel, professional fees, other personnel, financial and management systems and controls and facilities, which will result in additional operating expenses. Under the circumstances described above, our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects may be materially adversely affected.We expect to acquire new properties and this may create risks.We may acquire properties when we believe that an acquisition matches our business and investment strategies. These properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential. It is possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline after we acquire them, or that they may not perform as expected. Further, if financed by additional debt or new equity issuances, our acquisition of properties may result in stockholder dilution. Our acquisition of properties will expose us to the liabilities of those properties, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of such acquisitions. We face competition in pursuing these acquisitions and we may not succeed in leasing acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of their acquisition and operations.Newly acquired properties may require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. We may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions. Consequences arising from or in connection with any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.We are pursuing redevelopment opportunities and this creates risks to our Company.We have commenced a program to redevelop certain of our properties, and to recapture select properties from our net lease portfolio in order to redevelop such properties, for either a new convenience and gasoline use or for alternative single tenant net lease retail uses. The success at each stage of our redevelopment program is dependent on numerous factors and risks, including our ability to identify and extract qualified sites from our portfolio and successfully prepare and market them for alternative uses, and project development issues, including those relating to planning, zoning, licensing, permitting, third party and governmental authorizations, changes in local market conditions, increases in construction costs, the availability and cost of financing, and issues arising from possible discovery of new environmental contamination and the need to conduct environmental remediation. Occupancy rates and rents at any particular redeveloped property may fail to meet our original expectations for reasons beyond our control, including changes in market and economic conditions and the development by competitors of competing properties. We could experience increased and unexpected costs or significant delays or abandonment of some or all of these redevelopment opportunities. For any of the above-described reasons, 19 and others, we may determine to abandon opportunities that we have already begun to explore or with respect to which we have commenced redevelopment efforts and, as a result, we may fail to recover expenses already incurred. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully redevelop and lease any of our identified opportunities or that our overall redevelopment program will be successful. Consequences arising from or in connection with any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.Risks Related to Our Status as a REITFailure to qualify as a REIT under the federal income tax laws would have adverse consequences to our stockholders. Uncertain tax matters may have a significant impact on the results of operations for any single fiscal year or interim period or may cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT.We elected to be treated as a REIT under the federal income tax laws beginning January 1, 2001. To qualify for taxation as a REIT, we must, among other requirements such as those related to the composition of our assets and gross income, distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income, including taxable income that is accrued by us without a corresponding receipt of cash. Accordingly, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on qualifying REIT income, provided that distributions to our stockholders equal at least the amount of our taxable income as defined under the Internal Revenue Code. But, we may have to borrow money or sell assets to satisfy such distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. Many of the REIT requirements are highly technical and complex. If we were to fail to meet the requirements, we may be subject to federal income tax, excise taxes, penalties and interest or we may have to pay a deficiency dividend. We may have to borrow money or sell assets to pay such a deficiency dividend.We cannot guarantee that we will continue to qualify in the future as a REIT. We cannot give any assurance that new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the requirements relating to our qualification. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and will again be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates, we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax for taxable years beginning before 2019, we could be required to pay significant income taxes and we would have less money available for our operations and distributions to stockholders. This would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities. We could also be precluded from treatment as a REIT for four taxable years following the year in which we lost the qualification, and all distributions to stockholders would be taxable as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Loss of our REIT status could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.The U.S. federal income tax treatment of the cash that we might receive from cash settlement of a forward sale agreement under our ATM Program is unclear and could jeopardize our ability to meet the REIT qualification requirements.In the event that we elect to settle any forward sale agreement for cash and the settlement price is below the applicable forward sale price, we would be entitled to receive a cash payment from the relevant Forward Purchaser. Under Section 1032 of the Code, generally, no gains and losses are recognized by a corporation in dealing in its own shares, including pursuant to a “securities futures contract,” as defined in the Code by reference to the Exchange Act. Although we believe that any amount received by us in exchange for our stock would qualify for the exemption under Section 1032 of the Code, because it is not entirely clear whether a forward sale agreement qualifies as a “securities futures contract,” the U.S. federal income tax treatment of any cash settlement payment we receive is uncertain. In the event that we recognize a significant gain from the cash settlement of a forward sale agreement, we might not be able to satisfy the gross income requirements applicable to REITs under the Code. In that case, we may be able to rely upon the relief provisions under the Code in order to avoid the loss of our REIT status. Even if the relief provisions apply, we will be subject to a 100% tax on the greater of (i) the excess of 75% of our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) over the amount of such income attributable to sources that qualify under the 75% test or (ii) the excess of 95% of our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) over the amount of such gross income attributable to sources that qualify under the 95% test, multiplied in either case by a fraction intended to reflect our profitability. In the event that these relief provisions were not available, we could lose our REIT status under the Code.There is a risk of changes in the tax law applicable to real estate investment trusts.Because the IRS, the United States Treasury Department and Congress frequently review federal income tax legislation, we cannot predict whether, when or to what extent new federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be adopted. Any of such legislative actions may prospectively or retroactively modify our tax treatment and, therefore, may adversely affect taxation of us and/or our investors.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the TCJA, as amended by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. businesses and their owners, including REITs and their shareholders. Changes made by the TCJA and the CARES Act that could affect us and our shareholders include:20 •temporarily reducing individual U.S. federal income tax rates on ordinary income; the highest individual U.S. federal income tax rate has been reduced from 39.6% to 37% for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026;•permanently eliminating the progressive corporate tax rate structure, with a maximum corporate tax rate of 35%, and replacing it with a flat corporate tax rate of 21%;•permitting a deduction for certain pass-through business income, including dividends received by our shareholders from us that are not designated by us as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income, which will generally allow individuals, trusts, and estates to deduct up to 20% of such amounts for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026;•reducing the highest rate of withholding with respect to our distributions to non-U.S. stockholders that are treated as attributable to gains from the sale or exchange of U.S. real property interests from 35% to 21%;•limiting our deduction for net operating losses to 80% of REIT taxable income (prior to the application of the dividends paid deduction) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020;•generally limiting the deduction for net business interest expense in excess of a specified percentage (50% for taxable years beginning in 2019 and 2020 and 30% for subsequent taxable years) of a business’s adjusted taxable income except for taxpayers that engage in certain real estate businesses and elect out of this rule (provided that such electing taxpayers must use an alternative depreciation system for certain property); and•eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax.You are urged to consult with your tax advisor with respect to the status of legislative, regulatory, judicial or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our securities.U.S. federal tax reform legislation could affect REITs generally, our tenants, the markets in which we operate, the price of our common stock and our results of operations, in ways, both positively and negatively, that are difficult to predict.Certain federal tax legislation more specifically described above (the “2017 Legislation”) included significant changes to corporate and individual tax rates and the calculation of taxes. As a REIT, we are generally not required to pay federal taxes otherwise applicable to regular corporations if we distribute all of our income and comply with the various tax rules governing REITs. Stockholders, however, are generally required to pay taxes on REIT dividends. The 2017 Legislation changed the way in which dividends paid on our stock are taxed by the holder of that stock and could impact the price of our common stock or how stockholders and potential investors view an investment in REITs. In addition, while certain elements of the 2017 Legislation do not impact us directly as a REIT, they could impact our tenants and the markets in which we operate in ways, both positive and negative, that are difficult to predict. Prospective stockholders are urged to consult with their tax advisors with respect to the 2017 Legislation and any other regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and the potential effects thereof on an investment in our common stock.In order to preserve our REIT status, our charter limits the number of shares a person may own, which may discourage a takeover that could result in a premium price for our common stock or otherwise benefit our stockholders.Our charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our Board of Directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Unless exempted by our Board of Directors, no person may (i) own, or be deemed to own by virtue of certain constructive ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, in excess of 5.0% (in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our common stock or (ii) own, or be deemed to own by virtue of certain other constructive ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, in excess of 9.9% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding shares of our common stock, which may discourage large investors from purchasing our stock. This restriction may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all of our assets) that might provide a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders.Risks Related to Ownership of Our SecuritiesChanges in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded common stock.As with other publicly traded securities, the market price of our publicly traded common stock depends on various market conditions, which may change from time-to-time. Among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded common stock are the following: our financial condition and performance and that of our significant tenants; the market’s perception of our growth potential and potential future earnings; the reputation of REITs generally and the reputation of REITs with portfolios similar to us; the attractiveness of the securities of REITs in comparison to securities issued by other entities (including securities issued by other real estate companies); an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution 21 rate in relation to the price paid for publicly traded securities; the extent of institutional investor interest in us; and general economic and financial market conditions.We may change our dividend policy and the dividends we pay may be subject to significant volatility.The decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon such factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant and the dividend paid may vary from expected amounts. Any change in our dividend policy could adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock. In addition, each of the Second Restated Credit Agreement and senior unsecured notes prohibit the payments of dividends during certain events of default. No assurance can be given that our financial performance in the future will permit our payment of any dividends or that the amount of dividends we pay, if any, will not fluctuate significantly. Under the Maryland General Corporation Law (“MGCL”), our ability to pay dividends would be restricted if, after payment of the dividend, (i) we would not be able to pay indebtedness as it becomes due in the usual course of business or (ii) our total assets would be less than the sum of our liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if we were to be dissolved, to satisfy the rights of any stockholders with liquidation preferences. There currently are no stockholders with liquidation preferences. No assurance can be given that our financial performance in the future will permit our payment of any dividends. Each of the Second Restated Credit Agreement our senior unsecured notes contain customary financial covenants such as availability, leverage and coverage ratios and minimum tangible net worth, as well as limitations on restricted payments, which may limit our ability to incur additional debt or pay dividends. As a result of the factors described above, we may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis, which could materially and adversely affect our business, stock price and ability to pay dividends.Future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our equity securities.Our future growth depends upon our ability to raise additional capital. If we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities, such issuance, the receipt of the net proceeds thereof and the use of such proceeds may have a dilutive effect on our expected earnings per share, funds from operations per share and adjusted funds from operations per share. The actual amount of such dilution cannot be determined at this time and will be based on numerous factors. Additionally, we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or preferred stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities in the future. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market after an offering or the perception that such sales could occur.Provisions contained in a forward sale agreement under our ATM Program could result in substantial dilution to our earnings per share and return on equity or result in substantial cash payment obligations.If we enter into one or more forward sale agreements in connection with the ATM Program, the relevant Forward Purchaser (as defined in such forward sale agreement) will have the right to accelerate its forward sale agreement (with respect to all or any portion of the transaction under such forward sale agreement that the Forward Purchaser determines is affected by an event described below) and require us to physically settle on a date specified by such Forward Purchaser if:•in such Forward Purchaser’s good faith, commercially reasonable judgment, it or its affiliate (x) is unable to hedge its exposure under such forward sale agreement because an insufficient number of shares of our common stock have been made available for borrowing by securities lenders or (y) would incur a stock loan cost in excess of a specified threshold to hedge its exposure under such forward sale agreement;•we declare any dividend, issue or distribution on shares of our common stock (a) payable in cash in excess of specified amounts (unless it is an extraordinary dividend), (b) payable in securities of another company that we acquire or own (directly or indirectly) as a result of a spin-off or similar transaction, or (c) payable in any other type of securities (other than shares of our common stock), rights, warrants or other assets for payment at less than the prevailing market price;•certain ownership thresholds applicable to such Forward Purchaser and its affiliates are exceeded;•an event is announced that if consummated would result in a specified extraordinary event (including certain mergers or tender offers, as well as certain events involving our nationalization, or insolvency, or a delisting of shares of our common stock) or the occurrence of a change in law under such forward sale agreement; or•certain other events of default or termination events occur, including, among others, any material misrepresentation made in connection with such forward sale agreement (each as more fully described in each forward sale agreement).A Forward Purchaser’s decision to exercise its right to accelerate the physical settlement of any forward sale agreement and require us to physically settle on a date specified by such Forward Purchaser will be made irrespective of our interests, including our need for capital. In such cases, we could be required to issue and deliver shares of shares of our common stock under the physical 22 settlement provisions of the applicable forward sale agreement, irrespective of our capital needs, which would result in dilution to our earnings per share and return on equity.We expect that settlement of any forward sale agreement will generally occur no later than the date specified in the particular forward sale agreement, which will be no earlier than three months or later than two years following the trade date of that forward sale agreement. However, any forward sale agreement may be settled earlier than that specified date in whole or in part at our option. Subject to certain conditions, we have the right to elect physical, cash or net share settlement under each forward sale agreement. We intend to physically settle each forward sale agreement by delivery of shares of our common stock. However, we may elect to cash settle or net share settle such forward sale agreement. Delivery of shares of our common stock upon physical settlement (or, if we elect net share settlement of a particular forward sale agreement, upon such settlement to the extent we are obligated to deliver shares of our common stock) will result in dilution to our earnings per share and return on equity. If we elect cash settlement or net share settlement with respect to all or a portion of the shares of common stock underlying a particular forward sale agreement, we expect the applicable Forward Purchaser (or an affiliate thereof) to purchase a number of shares of our common stock in secondary market transactions over an unwind period to:•return shares of our common stock to securities lenders in order to unwind such Forward Purchaser’s hedge (after taking into consideration any shares of our common stock to be delivered by us to such Forward Purchaser, in the case of net share settlement); and•if applicable, in the case of net share settlement, deliver shares of our common stock to us to the extent required in settlement of such forward sale agreement.The purchase of shares of our common stock in connection with a Forward Purchaser or its affiliate unwinding such Forward Purchaser’s hedge positions could cause the price of shares of our common stock to increase over such time (or prevent a decrease over such time), thereby increasing the amount of cash we would owe to such Forward Purchaser (or decreasing the amount of cash that such Forward Purchaser would owe to us) upon a cash settlement of the relevant forward sale agreement or increasing the number of shares of our common stock we would deliver to such Forward Purchaser (or decreasing the number of shares of our common stock that such Forward Purchaser would deliver to us) upon net share settlement of the relevant forward sale agreement.The forward sale price that we expect to receive upon physical settlement of a particular forward sale agreement will be subject to adjustment on a daily basis based on a floating interest rate factor equal to the overnight bank rate less a spread and will be decreased based on amounts related to expected dividends on shares of our common stock during the term of the applicable forward sale agreement. If the overnight bank rate is less than the spread for a particular forward sale agreement on any day, the interest factor will result in a daily reduction of the applicable forward sale price. If the volume-weighted average price at which a particular Forward Purchaser (or its affiliate) is able to purchase (or is deemed able to purchase) shares during the applicable unwind period under a particular forward sale agreement is above the relevant forward sale price, in the case of cash settlement, we would pay the relevant Forward Purchaser under such forward sale agreement an amount in cash equal to the difference or, in the case of net share settlement, we would deliver to such Forward Purchaser a number of shares of our common stock having a value equal to the difference. Thus, we could be responsible for a potentially substantial cash payment in the case of cash settlement. If the volume-weighted average price at which a particular Forward Purchaser (or its affiliate) is able to purchase (or is deemed able to purchase) shares during the applicable unwind period under that particular forward sale agreement is below the relevant forward sale price, in the case of cash settlement, we would be paid the difference in cash by the relevant Forward Purchaser under that particular forward sale agreement or, in the case of net share settlement, we would receive from such Forward Purchaser a number of shares of our common stock having a value equal to the difference.  In case of our bankruptcy or insolvency, any forward sale agreement under our ATM Program that is in effect will automatically terminate, and we would not receive the expected proceeds from any forward sales of shares of our common stock.If we or a regulatory authority with jurisdiction over us institutes, or we consent to, a proceeding seeking a judgment in bankruptcy or insolvency or any other relief under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or other similar law affecting creditors’ rights, or we or a regulatory authority with jurisdiction over us presents a petition for our winding-up or liquidation, or we consent to such a petition, any forward sale agreement that is then in effect will automatically terminate. If any such forward sale agreement so terminates under these circumstances, we would not be obligated to deliver to the relevant Forward Purchaser any shares of common stock not previously delivered, and the relevant Forward Purchaser would be discharged from its obligation to pay the applicable forward sale price per share in respect of any shares of common stock not previously settled under the applicable forward sale agreement. Therefore, to the extent that there are any shares of common stock with respect to which any forward sale agreement has not been settled at the time of the commencement of any such bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, we would not receive the relevant forward sale price per share in respect of those shares of common stock.Maryland law may discourage a third-party from acquiring us.We are subject to the provisions of the Maryland Business Combination Act (the “Business Combination Act”) which prohibits transactions between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after 23 the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Generally, pursuant to the Business Combination Act, an “interested stockholder” is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of a Maryland corporation’s voting stock. These provisions could have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of our Company or reducing the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our capital stock. Additionally, the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act may deny voting rights to shares involved in an acquisition of one-tenth or more of the voting stock of a Maryland corporation. In our charter and bylaws, we have elected not to have the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act apply to any acquisition by any person of shares of stock of our Company. However, in the case of the control share acquisition statute, our Board of Directors may opt to make this statute applicable to us at any time by amending our bylaws, and may do so on a retroactive basis. Finally, the “unsolicited takeovers” provisions of the MGCL permit our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to implement certain provisions that may have the effect of inhibiting a third-party from making an acquisition proposal for our Company or of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our Company under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price or that stockholders may otherwise believe is in their best interests; however, on February 23, 2022, our Board of Directors adopted a resolution prohibiting us from electing to be subject to the classified board provisions of Section 3-803 of the MGCL, unless such election is first approved by the stockholders of the Corporation by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast on the matter by stockholders entitled to vote generally in the election of directors"
4,GTY,GETTY REALTY CORP,2022-02-24,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
We are subject to various risks, many of which are beyond our control. As a result of these and other factors, we may experience material fluctuations in our future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. An investment in our stock involves various risks, including those mentioned below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and those that are described from time to time in our other filings with the SEC.Summary of Risk Factors
Our business is subject to risks and uncertainties, including those risks and uncertainties discussed at-length below, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following:Risks Related to Our Business and Operations •The risks inherent in owning or leasing real estate.  •The real estate industry is highly competitive.  •Our future cash flow is dependent on the performance of our tenants of their lease obligations, renewal of existing leases and either re-leasing or selling our properties. •Significant number of our tenants depend on the same industry for their revenues.  •It may be difficult for our investors to determine the creditworthiness of our tenants. •An increase in costs and liability accruals as a result of environmental laws and regulations could adversely affect our business.  •We are defending pending lawsuits and claims that may subject us to material losses.  •We may be subject to losses that may not be covered by insurance. 9  •The concentration of a significant number of our properties in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, and adverse conditions in those regions, in particular, could negatively impact our operations. •Property taxes on our properties may increase without notice.  •Our business operations may not generate sufficient cash for distributions or debt service. •Adverse developments in general business, economic or political conditions could have a material adverse effect on us. •Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the market on which our common stock trades, the markets in which we operate, our operations and our results of operations. •Our exposure to counterparty risk. •Inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. •Our assets may be subject to impairment charges.  •Our accounting policies and methods require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. •Amendments to the Accounting Standards Codification made by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) or changes in accounting standards may adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability or financial position. •If we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately and timely report our financial results. •Our reliance on certain members of our management team or Board of Directors, the loss of any one of which could adversely affect our business or the market price of our common stock.  •Our reliance on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business. •Our business and results of operations have been, and our financial condition may be, impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.Risks Related to Financing Our Business •Our dependency on external sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.  •Interest rate risk and our ability to manage or mitigate this risk effectively.  •Adverse effects by the transition from LIBOR.Risks Related to Our Investment Strategy •We may not be able to successfully implement our investment strategy.  •We expect to acquire new properties and this may create risks.  •We are pursuing redevelopment opportunities and this creates risks to our Company. Risks Related to Our Status as a REIT •The failure to qualify as a REIT under the federal income tax laws would have adverse consequences to our stockholders. Uncertain tax matters may have a significant impact on the results of operations for any single fiscal year or interim period or may cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT. •The uncertainty regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the cash that we might receive from cash settlement of a forward sale agreement under our ATM program could jeopardize our ability to meet the REIT qualification requirements. •A risk of changes in the tax law applicable to REITs. •U.S. federal tax reform legislation could affect REITs generally, our tenants, the markets in which we operate, the price of our common stock and our results of operations. •In order to preserve our REIT status, our charter limits the number of shares a person may own, which may discourage a takeover that could result in a premium price for our common stock or otherwise benefit our stockholders.10 Risks Related to Ownership of Our Securities •Changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded common stock. •Changes in our dividend policy and the dividends we pay may be subject to significant volatility. •Our forward sale agreement under our ATM Program could result in substantial dilution to our earnings per share and return on equity or result in substantial cash payment obligations. •In case of our bankruptcy or insolvency, any forward sale agreement that is in effect under our ATM Program will automatically terminate, and we would not receive the expected proceeds. •Future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our equity securities. •Maryland law may discourage a third-party from acquiring us.Risks Related to Our Business and OperationsWe are subject to risks inherent in owning and leasing real estate.We are subject to varying degrees of risk generally related to leasing and owning real estate, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to general risks applicable to us, our risks include, among others: our liability as a lessee for long-term lease obligations regardless of our revenues; deterioration in national, regional and local economic and real estate market conditions; potential changes in supply of, or demand for, rental properties similar to ours; competition for tenants and declining rental rates; difficulty in selling or re-leasing properties on favorable terms or at all; impairments in our ability to collect rent or other payments due to us when they are due; increases in interest rates and adverse changes in the availability, cost and terms of financing; uninsured property liability; the impact of present or future environmental legislation and compliance with environmental laws; adverse changes in zoning laws and other regulations; acts of terrorism and war; acts of God; the unforeseen impacts of climate change, compliance with any future laws or regulations designed to prevent or mitigate the impacts of climate change, and any material costs related thereto; the potential risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time the need to periodically renovate and repair our properties; and physical or weather-related damage to our properties. Certain significant expenditures generally do not change in response to economic or other conditions, including: (i) debt service, (ii) real estate taxes, (iii) environmental remediation costs and (iv) operating and maintenance costs. The combination of variable revenue and relatively fixed expenditures may result, under certain market conditions, in reduced earnings and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.Each of the factors listed above could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. In addition, real estate investments are relatively illiquid, which means that our ability to vary our portfolio of properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be limited.We are in a competitive business.The real estate industry is highly competitive. Where we own properties, we compete for tenants with a large number of real estate property owners and other companies that sublet properties. Our principal means of competition are rents we are able to charge in relation to the income producing potential of the location. In addition, we expect other major real estate investors, some with much greater financial resources or more experienced personnel than we have, will compete with us for attractive acquisition opportunities. These competitors include petroleum manufacturing, distributing and marketing companies, convenience store retailers, other REITs, public and private investment funds, and other individual and institutional investors. This competition has increased prices for properties we seek to acquire and may impair our ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms in the future.Our future cash flow is dependent on the performance of our tenants of their lease obligations, renewal of existing leases and either re-leasing or selling our properties.We are subject to risks that financial distress, default or bankruptcy of our tenants may lead to vacancy at our properties or disruption in rent receipts as a result of partial payment or nonpayment of rent or that expiring leases may not be renewed. Under unfavorable general economic conditions, there can be no assurance that our tenants’ level of sales and financial performance generally will not be adversely affected, which in turn could negatively impact our rental revenues. We are subject to risks that the terms governing renewal or re-leasing of our properties (including, compliance with numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment, such as the remediation of contamination and the retirement and decommissioning or removal of long-lived assets, the cost of required renovations, or replacement of USTs and related equipment) may be less favorable than current lease terms.We are also subject to the risk that we may receive less net proceeds from the properties we sell as compared to their current carrying value or that the value of our properties may be adversely affected by unfavorable general economic conditions. Unfavorable general economic conditions may also negatively impact our ability to re-lease or sell our properties. Numerous properties compete 11 with our properties in attracting tenants to lease space. The number of available or competitive properties in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease or sell our properties and on the rents we are able to charge. In addition to the risk of disruption in rent receipts, we are subject to the risk of incurring real estate taxes, maintenance, environmental and other expenses at vacant properties. The financial distress, default or bankruptcy of our tenants may also lead to protracted and expensive processes for retaking control of our properties than would otherwise be the case, including, eviction or other legal proceedings related to or resulting from the tenant’s default. These risks are greater with respect to certain of our tenants who lease multiple properties from us. If a tenant files for bankruptcy protection it is possible that we would recover substantially less than the full value of our claims against the tenant. If (i) our tenants do not perform their lease obligations, (ii) we are unable to renew existing leases and promptly recapture and re-lease or sell our properties, (iii) lease terms upon renewal or re-leasing are less favorable than current or historical lease terms, (iv) the values of properties that we sell are adversely affected by market conditions, or (v) we incur significant costs or disruption related to or resulting from tenant financial distress, default or bankruptcy, then our cash flow could be significantly adversely affected.Significant number of our tenants depend on the same industry for their revenues. We derive significant portion of our revenues from leasing, primarily on a triple-net basis, and financing convenience store and gasoline station properties to tenants in the petroleum marketing industry. Accordingly, significant portion of our revenues depend on the economic success of the petroleum marketing industry, and any factors that adversely affect that industry, such as disruption in the supply of petroleum or a decrease in the demand for conventional motor fuels due to conservation, technological advancements in petroleum-fueled motor vehicles or an increase in the use of, and consumer demand for, alternative fuel, electric and battery-operated vehicles, or other “green technologies,” could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. Similarly, governmental regulations regarding climate change and the greenhouse gas emissions may accelerate these trends that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. The success of participants in the petroleum marketing industry depends upon the sale of refined petroleum products at margins in excess of fixed and variable expenses. The petroleum marketing industry is highly competitive and volatile. Petroleum products are commodities, the prices of which depend on numerous factors that affect supply and demand. The prices paid by our tenants and other petroleum marketers for products are affected by global, national and regional factors. A large, rapid increase in wholesale petroleum prices would adversely affect the profitability and cash flows of our tenants if the increased cost of petroleum products could not be passed on to their customers or if automobile consumption of gasoline was to decline significantly. We cannot be certain as to how these factors will affect petroleum product prices or supply in the future, or how in particular they will affect our tenants.Because certain of our tenants are not rated and their financial information is not available to you, it may be difficult for our investors to determine their creditworthiness.The majority of our properties are leased to tenants who are not rated by any nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. In addition, our tenants’ financial information is not generally available to our investors. Additionally, many of our tenants are part of larger corporate organizations and we do not receive financial information for the other entities in those organizations. The financial distress of other affiliated companies or businesses in those organizations may negatively impact the ability or willingness of our tenant to perform its obligations under its lease with us. Because of the lack of financial information or credit ratings it is, therefore, difficult for our investors to assess the creditworthiness of our tenants and to determine the ability of our tenants to meet their obligations to us. It is possible that the assumptions and estimates we make after reviewing publicly and privately obtained information about our tenants are not accurate and that we may be required to increase reserves for bad debts, record allowances for deferred rent receivable or record additional expenses if our tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations to us.We incur significant operating costs and, from time to time, may have significant liability accruals as a result of environmental laws and regulations, which costs and accruals could significantly increase, and reduce our profitability or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, including matters relating to the protection of the environment. Under certain environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at, on, or under, such property, and may be required to investigate and clean-up such contamination. Such laws typically impose liability and clean-up responsibility first on the party responsible for the contamination, but can also impose liability and clean-up responsibility on the owner and the current operator without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants, or the timing or cause of the contamination. Liability under such environmental laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility and the financial resources are available to perform the remediation. For example, liability may arise as a result of the historical use of a property or from the migration of contamination from adjacent or nearby properties. Any such contamination or liability may also reduce the value of the property. In addition, the owner or operator of 12 a property may be subject to claims by third-parties based on injury, damage and/or costs, including investigation and clean-up costs, resulting from environmental contamination present at or emanating from a property. We cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations may be enacted in the future, or how existing laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted with respect to products or activities to which they have not previously been applied. Additionally, compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of the regulatory agencies or stricter interpretation of existing laws, which may develop in the future, could have an adverse effect on our financial position, or that of our tenants, and could require substantial additional expenditures for future remediation. Accordingly, compliance with environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.The majority of the properties owned or controlled by us are leased as convenience store and gasoline station properties, and therefore may contain, or may have contained, USTs for the storage of petroleum products and other hazardous or toxic substances, which creates a potential for the release of such products or substances. Some of our properties are subject to regulations regarding the retirement and decommissioning or removal of long-lived assets including buildings containing hazardous materials, USTs and other equipment. Some of the properties may be adjacent to or near properties that have contained or currently contain USTs used to store petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, certain of the properties are on, adjacent to, or near properties upon which others have engaged or may in the future engage in activities that may release petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. There may be other environmental problems associated with our properties of which we are unaware. These problems may make it more difficult for us to re-lease or sell our properties on favorable terms, or at all.We enter into leases and various other agreements which contractually allocate responsibility between the parties for known and unknown environmental liabilities at or relating to the subject properties. We are contingently liable for these environmental obligations in the event that our tenant does not satisfy them, and we are required to accrue for environmental liabilities that we believe are allocable to others under our leases if we determine that it is probable that our tenant will not meet its environmental obligations. It is possible that our assumptions regarding the ultimate allocation method and share of responsibility that we used to allocate environmental liabilities may change, which may result in material adjustments to the amounts recorded for environmental litigation accruals and environmental remediation liabilities. We assess whether to accrue for environmental liabilities based upon relevant factors including our tenants’ histories of paying for such obligations, our assessment of their financial capability, and their intent to pay for such obligations. However, there can be no assurance that our assessments are correct or that our tenants who have paid their obligations in the past will continue to do so. We may ultimately be responsible to pay for environmental liabilities as the property owner if our tenant fails to pay them. The ultimate resolution of these matters could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.For substantially all of our triple-net leases, our tenants are contractually responsible for compliance with environmental laws and regulations, removal of USTs at the end of their lease term (the cost of which in certain cases is partially borne by us) and remediation of any environmental contamination that arises during the term of their tenancy. Under the terms of our leases covering properties previously leased to Marketing (substantially all of which commenced in 2012), we have agreed to be responsible for environmental contamination at the premises that was known at the time the lease commenced, and for environmental contamination which existed prior to commencement of the lease and is discovered (other than as a result of a voluntary site investigation) during the first 10 years of the lease term (or a shorter period for a minority of such leases). After expiration of such 10-year (or, in certain cases, shorter) period, responsibility for all newly discovered contamination, even if it relates to periods prior to commencement of the lease, is contractually allocated to our tenant. Our tenants at properties previously leased to Marketing are in all cases responsible for the cost of any remediation of contamination that results from their use and occupancy of our properties. Under substantially all of our other triple-net leases, responsibility for remediation of all environmental contamination discovered during the term of the lease (including known and unknown contamination that existed prior to commencement of the lease) is the responsibility of our tenant.We anticipate that USTs at a number of properties we currently own and which were previously leased to Marketing will be replaced in the years ahead as these USTs near the end of their useful lives. For long-term, triple-net leases covering sites previously leased to Marketing, our tenants are responsible for the cost of removal and replacement of USTs and for remediation of contamination found during such UST removal and replacement, unless such contamination was found during the first 10 years of the lease term and also existed prior to commencement of the lease. In those cases, we are responsible for costs associated with the remediation of such preexisting contamination. We have also agreed to be responsible for environmental contamination that existed prior to the sale of certain properties assuming the contamination is discovered (other than as a result of a voluntary site investigation) during the first five years after the sale of the properties.In the course of certain UST removals and replacements at properties previously leased to Marketing where we retained continuing responsibility for preexisting environmental obligations, previously unknown environmental contamination was and continues to be discovered. As a result, we have developed an estimate of fair value for the prospective future environmental liability resulting from preexisting unknown environmental contamination and have accrued for these estimated costs. These estimates are based primarily upon quantifiable trends which we believe allow us to make reasonable estimates of fair value for the future costs of environmental remediation resulting from the removal and replacement of USTs. Our accrual of the additional liability represents our estimate of the fair value of cost for each component of the liability, net of estimated recoveries from state UST remediation funds considering estimated recovery rates developed from prior experience with the funds. In arriving at our accrual, we analyzed the ages of USTs at properties where we would be responsible for preexisting contamination found within 10 years after commencement of a 13 lease (for properties subject to long-term triple-net leases) or five years from a sale (for divested properties), and projected a cost to closure for preexisting unknown environmental contamination.We measure our environmental remediation liabilities at fair value based on expected future net cash flows, adjusted for inflation, and then discount them to present value. We adjust our environmental remediation liabilities quarterly to reflect changes in projected expenditures, changes in present value due to the passage of time and reductions in estimated liabilities as a result of actual expenditures incurred during each quarter. As of December 31, 2021, we had accrued a total of $47.6 million for our prospective environmental remediation obligations. This accrual consisted of (a) $11.4 million, which was our estimate of reasonably estimable environmental remediation liability, including obligations to remove USTs for which we are responsible, net of estimated recoveries and (b) $36.2 million for future environmental liabilities related to preexisting unknown contamination.For additional information regarding pending environmental lawsuits and claims, and environmental remediation obligations and estimates, see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings”, “Environmental Matters” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Notes 3 and 5 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K.Environmental exposures are difficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons, including the amount of data available upon initial assessment of contamination, alternative treatment methods that may be applied, location of the property which subjects it to differing local laws and regulations and their interpretations, changes in costs associated with environmental remediation services and equipment, the availability of state UST remediation funds and the possibility of existing legal claims giving rise to allocation of responsibilities to others, as well as the time it takes to remediate contamination and receive regulatory approval. In developing our liability for estimated environmental remediation obligations on a property by property basis, we consider, among other things, laws and regulations, assessments of contamination and surrounding geology, quality of information available, currently available technologies for treatment, alternative methods of remediation and prior experience. Environmental accruals are based on estimates derived upon facts known to us at this time, which are subject to significant change as circumstances change, and as environmental contingencies become more clearly defined and reasonably estimable.We cannot predict if state UST fund programs will be administered and funded in the future in a manner that is consistent with past practices and if future environmental spending will continue to be eligible for reimbursement at historical recovery rates under these programs. As a result, our estimates in respect of recoveries from state UST remediation funds could change, which could adversely affect our accruals for environmental remediation liabilities.Any changes to our estimates or our assumptions that form the basis of our estimates may result in our providing an accrual, or adjustments to the amounts recorded, for environmental remediation liabilities. Additional environmental liabilities could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.We are defending pending lawsuits and claims and are subject to material losses.We are subject to various lawsuits and claims, including litigation related to environmental matters, such as those arising from leaking USTs, contamination of groundwater with methyl tertiary butyl ether (a fuel derived from methanol, commonly referred to as “MTBE”) and releases of motor fuel into the environment, and toxic tort claims. The ultimate resolution of certain matters cannot be predicted because considerable uncertainty exists both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimate of such loss. Our ultimate liabilities resulting from the lawsuits and claims we face could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. For additional information with respect to certain pending lawsuits and claims, see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” and Note 3 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K.We are subject to losses that may not be covered by insurance.We and our tenants carry insurance against certain risks and in such amounts as we believe are customary for businesses of our kind. However, as the costs and availability of insurance change, we may decide not to be covered against certain losses (such as certain environmental liabilities, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and civil disorder) where, in the judgment of management, the insurance is not warranted due to cost or availability of coverage or the remoteness of perceived risk. Furthermore, there are certain types of losses, such as losses resulting from wars, terrorism or certain acts of God, that generally are not insured because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. There is no assurance that the existing insurance coverages are or will be sufficient to cover actual losses incurred. The destruction of, or significant damage to, or significant liabilities arising out of conditions at, our properties due to an uninsured loss would result in an economic loss and could result in us losing both our investment in, and anticipated profits from, such properties. When a loss is insured, the coverage may be insufficient in amount or duration, or a lessee’s customers may be lost, such that the lessee cannot resume its business after the loss at prior levels or at all, resulting in reduced rent or a default under its lease. Any such loss relating to a large number of properties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.14 A significant portion of our properties are concentrated in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, and adverse conditions in those regions, in particular, could negatively impact our operations.A significant portion of the properties we own and lease are located in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States and, as of December 31, 2021, 38.7% of our properties are concentrated in three states (New York, Massachusetts and Connecticut). Because of the concentration of our properties in those regions, in the event of adverse economic conditions in those regions, we would likely experience higher risk of default on payment of rent to us than if our properties were more geographically diversified. Additionally, the rents on our properties may be subject to a greater risk of default than other properties in the event of adverse economic, political or business developments, natural disasters or severe weather that may affect the Northeast or Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States and the ability of our lessees to make rent payments. This lack of geographical diversification could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.Property taxes on our properties may increase without notice.Each of the properties we own or lease is subject to real property taxes. The leases for certain of the properties that we lease from third-parties obligate us to pay real property taxes with regard to those properties. The real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we acquire or lease in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities. To the extent that our tenants are unable or unwilling to pay such increase in accordance with their leases, our net operating expenses may increase.Our business operations may not generate sufficient cash for distributions or debt service.There is no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay dividends on our common stock, to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may not be able to repay or refinance existing indebtedness on favorable terms, which could force us to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms (which may also result in losses) or accept financing on unfavorable terms.Adverse developments in general business, economic or political conditions could have a material adverse effect on us.Adverse developments in general business and economic conditions, including through recession, downturn or otherwise, either in the economy generally or in those regions in which a large portion of our business is conducted, could have a material adverse effect on us and significantly increase certain of the risks we are subject to. Among other effects, adverse economic conditions could depress real estate values, impact our ability to re-lease or sell our properties and have an adverse effect on our tenants’ level of sales and financial performance generally. As our revenues are substantially dependent on the economic success of our tenants, any factors that adversely impact our tenants could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the market on which our common stock trades, the markets in which we operate, our operations and our results of operations.Terrorist attacks or other acts of violence or war could negatively affect our business or the businesses of our tenants. These attacks may directly or indirectly impact the physical facilities, networks or the business or the financial condition of us or those of our tenants, vendors or financial institutions with which we have a relationship or conduct business. The consequences of armed conflicts are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. More generally, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States and worldwide financial markets and economy. Terrorist attacks also could be a factor resulting in, or which could exacerbate, an economic recession in the United States or abroad. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.We are exposed to counterparty risk and there can be no assurances that we will effectively manage or mitigate this risk.We regularly interact with counterparties in various industries. The types of counterparties most common to our transactions and agreements include, but are not limited to, landlords, tenants, vendors and lenders. We also enter into agreements to acquire and sell properties which allocate responsibility for certain costs to the counterparty. Our most significant counterparties include, but are not limited to, the members of the bank syndicate related to our Second Restated Credit Agreement, the lenders that are the counterparties to our senior unsecured notes and our major tenants from whom we derive a significant amount of rental revenue. The default, insolvency or other inability or unwillingness of a significant counterparty to perform its obligations under an agreement, including, without limitation, as a result of the rejection of an agreement in bankruptcy proceedings, is likely to have a material adverse effect on us. 15 As of December 31, 2021, we leased 150 properties in three separate unitary leases and two stand-alone leases to subsidiaries of Global. In the aggregate, our leases with subsidiaries of Global represented 16% of our total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. All of our unitary leases with subsidiaries of Global are guaranteed by the parent company. As of December 31, 2021, we leased 128 properties in four separate unitary leases to subsidiaries of Arko. In the aggregate, our leases with subsidiaries of Arko represented 14% and 15% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. All of our unitary leases with subsidiaries of Arko are guaranteed by the parent company. As of December 31, 2021, we leased 78 properties in three separate unitary leases and one stand-alone lease to United Oil. In the aggregate, our leases with United Oil represented 11% and 12% of our total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we leased 69 properties in two separate unitary leases to subsidiaries of Chestnut. In the aggregate, our leases with subsidiaries of Chestnut represented 9% and 10% of our total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The largest of these unitary leases, covering 52 of our properties, is guaranteed by the parent company, its principals and numerous Chestnut affiliates.We may also undertake additional transactions with these or other existing tenants, which would further concentrate our sources of rental revenues. Many of our tenants, including those noted above, are part of larger corporate organizations and the financial distress of one subsidiary or other affiliated companies or businesses in those organizations may negatively impact the ability or willingness of our tenant to perform its obligations under its lease with us. The failure of a major tenant or their default in their rental and other obligations to us is likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.Inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Although inflation has not materially impacted our results of operations in the recent past, increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations. During times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, as provided for in our leases, rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation. Likewise, even though our triple-net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation, substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue, which may adversely affect our tenants’ ability to pay rent.Also, during inflationary periods, interest rates have historically increased, which would have a direct effect on the interest expense of our borrowings. Our exposure to increases in interest rates in the short term is limited to our variable-rate borrowings, which consist of borrowings under our Revolving Facility. Additionally, inflationary pricing may have a negative effect on the real estate acquisitions and construction costs necessary to complete our development and redevelopment projects, including, but not limited to, costs of construction materials, labor, and services from third-party contractors and suppliers. Higher acquisition and construction costs could adversely impact our net investments in real estate and expected yields on our development and redevelopment projects, which may make otherwise lucrative investment opportunities less profitable to us. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, as well as our ability to pay dividends, could be adversely affected over time.Our assets may be subject to impairment charges.We periodically evaluate our real estate investments and other assets for impairment indicators. The judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on GAAP, and includes a variety of factors such as market conditions, the accumulation of asset retirement costs due to changes in estimates associated with our estimated environmental liabilities, the status of significant leases, the financial condition of major tenants and other assumptions and factors that could affect the cash flow from or fair value of our properties. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we incurred $4.4 million and $4.3 million, respectively, of impairment charges. We may be required to take similar impairment charges, which could affect the implementation of our current business strategy and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial position and results of operations, and they require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain.Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial position and results of operations. We have identified several accounting policies as being critical to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations because they require management to make particularly subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be recorded under different conditions or using different assumptions. We cannot provide any assurance that we will not make subsequent significant adjustments to our consolidated financial statements. Estimates, judgments and assumptions underlying our consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, receivables and related reserves, deferred rent receivable, income under direct financing leases, asset retirement obligations (including environmental remediation obligations and future environmental liabilities for pre-existing unknown environmental contamination), real estate, depreciation and amortization, carrying value of our properties, impairment of long-lived assets, litigation, 16 accrued liabilities, income taxes and allocation of the purchase price of properties acquired to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If our accounting policies, methods, judgments, assumptions, estimates and allocations prove to be incorrect, or if circumstances change, our business, financial condition, revenues, operating expense, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price may be materially adversely affected.Amendments to the Accounting Standards Codification made by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) or changes in accounting standards issued by other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability or financial position.Our consolidated financial statements are subject to the application of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification, which is periodically amended by the FASB. The application of GAAP is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, we are required to adopt amendments to the Accounting Standards Codification or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time-to-time by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB and the SEC. Those changes could adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability or financial position.If we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately and timely report our financial results.Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, effectively prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. We are required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.As a result of material weaknesses or significant deficiencies that may be identified in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may also identify certain deficiencies in some of our disclosure controls and procedures that we believe require remediation. If we or our independent registered public accounting firm discover any such weaknesses or deficiencies, we will make efforts to further improve our internal control over financial reporting controls. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful. Any failure to maintain effective controls or timely effect any necessary improvement of our internal control over financial reporting controls could harm operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, which could affect the listing of our common stock on the NYSE. Ineffective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the per share trading price of our common stock.The loss of certain members of our management team or Board of Directors could adversely affect our business or the market price of our common stock.Our future success and ability to implement our business and investment strategy depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key management personnel and directors, and on the continued contributions of such persons, each of whom may be difficult to replace. As a REIT, we employ only 31 employees and have a cost-effective management structure. We do not have any employment agreements with any of our executives. In the event of the loss of key management personnel or directors, or upon unexpected death, disability or retirement, we may not be able to find replacements with comparable skill, ability and industry expertise, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. Additionally, certain of our directors beneficially own more than 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If any of these directors cease to be a director of the Company and they or their estate sell a significant portion of such holdings into the public market, it could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.We rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business. Additionally, our failure to comply with applicable privacy, data security or protection or cybersecurity laws could adversely affect our business.We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, including financial transactions and maintenance of records, which may include personal identifying information of tenants and lease data. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting and storing confidential tenant information, such as individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts. Although we have taken steps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems, it is possible that our security measures will not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning, or the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyberattacks. Security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, whether of our systems or those of our vendors or other third parties who hold or have access to our information, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Any failure by us, or our vendors or other third parties who hold or have access to our information to 17 maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect us.Governments are continuing to focus on privacy, cybersecurity, data protection and data security and it is possible that new privacy or data security laws will be passed or existing laws will be amended in a way that is material to our business. Any significant change to applicable laws, regulations, or industry practices regarding our employees’ and users’ data could require us to modify our business, services and products features, possibly in a material manner, and may limit our ability to develop new products, services, and features. Although we have made efforts to design our policies, procedures, and systems to comply with the current requirements of applicable state, federal, and foreign laws, changes to applicable laws and regulations in this area could subject us to additional regulation and oversight, any of which could significantly increase our operating costs.Our business and results of operations have been, and our financial condition may be, impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and such impact could be materially adverse. The global spread of COVID-19 has created significant volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, operations and financial results is uncertain, and will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business and individual actions taken in response to the pandemic and the impact of those actions on global economic activity; the actions taken in response to economic disruption; the reduced economic activity, if not closures from time to time of our tenants’ facilities, may impact our tenants' businesses, financial condition and liquidity, and may cause one or more of our tenants to be unable to meet their obligations to us in full, or at all, or to otherwise seek modifications of such obligations; general decline in business activity and demand for real estate transactions could adversely affect our ability or desire to grow our portfolio of properties; the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively impact our future compliance with financial covenants of our Second Restated Credit Agreement and our senior unsecured notes and result in a default and potentially an acceleration of indebtedness, which non-compliance could negatively impact our ability to make additional borrowings under our Revolving Facility and pay dividends; and a deterioration in our or our tenants’ ability to operate in affected areas or delays in the supply of products or services to us or our tenants from vendors that are needed for our or our tenants’ efficient operations could adversely affect our operations and those of our tenants.The rapid development and fluidity of this situation precludes any prediction as to the full adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to our performance, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and performance. Moreover, many risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, should be interpreted as heightened risks as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.Risks Related to Financing Our BusinessWe are dependent on external sources of capital which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.We are dependent on external sources of capital to maintain our status as a REIT and must distribute to our stockholders each year at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding any net capital gain. Because of these distribution requirements, it is not likely that we will be able to fund all future capital needs, including acquisitions, from income from operations. Therefore, we will have to continue to rely on third-party sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. We may need to access the capital markets in order to execute future significant acquisitions. There can be no assurance that sources of capital will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.Our principal sources of liquidity are the cash flows from our operations, funds available under our $300.0 million senior unsecured credit agreement (as amended, the “Second Restated Credit Agreement”), with a group of commercial banks led by Bank of America, N.A., proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock through offerings, from time to time, under our at-the-market program (“ATM Program”,) pursuant to which we may also sell shares of common stock under forward sale agreements and available cash and cash equivalents. Pursuant to the Second Restated Credit Agreement, we (i) extended the maturity date of the Revolving Facility from March 2022 to October 2025, (ii) reduced the interest rate for borrowings under the Revolving Facility and (iii) amended certain financial covenants and other provisions. The Second Restated Credit Agreement provides for the Revolving Facility in an aggregate principal amount of $300,000,000 and includes an accordion feature to increase the revolving commitments or add one or more tranches of term loans up to an additional aggregate amount not to exceed $300,000,000, subject to certain conditions, including one or more new or existing lenders agreeing to provide commitments for such increased amount and that no default or event of default shall have occurred and be continuing under the terms of the Revolving Facility. We have also issued $525.0 million of senior unsecured notes. For additional information, see “Credit Agreement” and “Senior Unsecured Notes” in Note 4 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K.The Second Restated Credit Agreement and our senior unsecured notes contain customary financial covenants such as leverage, coverage ratios and minimum tangible net worth, as well as limitations on restricted payments, which may limit our ability to incur 18 additional debt or pay dividends. The Second Restated Credit Agreement and our senior unsecured notes also contain customary events of default, including cross defaults to each other, change of control and failure to maintain REIT status (provided that the senior unsecured notes require a mandatory offer to prepay the notes upon a change in control in lieu of a change of control event of default). Our ability to meet the terms of the agreements is dependent upon our continued ability to meet certain criteria, as further described in Note 4 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K, the performance of our tenants and the other risks described in this section. If we are not in compliance with one or more of our covenants, which could result in an event of default under our Second Restated Credit Agreement or our senior unsecured notes, there can be no assurance that our lenders would waive such non-compliance. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.Under our ATM Program, we may issue and sell shares of our common stock with an aggregate sales price of up to $250.0 million through a consortium of banks acting as agents. Sales of shares of our common stock under our ATM Program may be made from time to time in at-the-market offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, including by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or as otherwise agreed to with the applicable agent. Sales of shares of our common stock under our ATM Program, if any, will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including among others, market conditions and the trading price of our common stock. Our agents are not required to sell any specific number or dollar amount of our common stock, but each agent will use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices and applicable law and regulation to sell shares designated by us in accordance with the terms of the distribution agreement with our agents. The net proceeds we receive will be the gross proceeds received from such sales less the commissions and any other costs we may incur in issuing the shares of our common stock. In connection with the expansion of the ATM Program in 2021, we may also sell shares of common stock under forward sale agreements.  The use of a forward sale agreement would allow us to lock in a price on the sale of shares of common stock at the time the agreement is executed, but defer receiving the proceeds from the sale until a later date. We may use a portion of the net proceeds from any of such sales to reduce our outstanding indebtedness, including borrowings under our Revolving Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility includes lenders who are affiliates of our agents and may be affiliates of our forward sellers and/or forward purchasers. As a result, a portion of the net proceeds from any sale of shares of our common stock under our ATM Program that is used to repay amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility will be received by these affiliates. Because an affiliate may receive a portion of the net proceeds from any of these sales, each of our agents may have an interest in these sales beyond the sales commission it will receive. This could result in a conflict of interest and cause such agents to act in a manner that is not in the best interests of us or our investors in connection with any sale of shares of our common stock under our ATM Program.Our access to third-party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors including general market conditions, the market’s perception of our growth potential, financial stability, our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions, covenants and limitations imposed under our Second Restated Credit Agreement and our senior unsecured notes, and the market price of our common stock.We are exposed to interest rate risk and there can be no assurances that we will manage or mitigate this risk effectively.We are exposed to interest rate risk, primarily as a result of our Second Restated Credit Agreement. Borrowings under our Second Restated Credit Agreement bear interest at a floating rate. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates will increase the amount of interest we must pay under our Second Restated Credit Agreement. Our interest rate risk may materially change in the future if we increase our borrowings under the Second Restated Credit Agreement or amend our Second Restated Credit Agreement or our senior unsecured notes, seek other sources of debt or equity capital or refinance our outstanding indebtedness. A significant increase in interest rates could also make it more difficult to find alternative financing on desirable terms. For additional information with respect to interest rate risk, see “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in this Form 10-K.We may be adversely affected by the transition from LIBOR.On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York convened the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (“ARRC”), a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, to identify an alternative reference rate.  ARRC identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), calculated by reference to short-term repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasury securities, as the recommended alternative reference rate for USD-LIBOR in derivative and other financial contracts and proposed a paced transition plan to transition USD-LIBOR to SOFR.  The first publication of SOFR was released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in April 2018. In November 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (the administrator of LIBOR) announced that it would consult on its intention to cease the publication of the one-week and two-month USD-LIBOR tenors only on December 31, 2021 and all other USD-LIBOR tenors on June 30, 2023. On March 5, 2021, the IBA issued a statement, based on such consultation, 19 announcing that the IBA shall cease publication of the respective USD-LIBOR tenors immediately after the foregoing dates and the FCA issued a statement that it has no intention to use its proposed powers to compel the IBA to publish any of the foregoing USD-LIBOR tenors and that such USD-LIBOR tenors shall no longer be representative after such dates. The Revolving Facility includes customary LIBOR transition language that addresses the succession of LIBOR at a future date.As of December 31, 2021, we had $60,000,000 of borrowings based on LIBOR. The consequences of these developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted and span multiple future periods but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate debt, which may be detrimental to our financial position or operating results.Risks Related to Our Investment StrategyWe may not be able to successfully implement our investment strategy.We may not be able to successfully implement our investment strategy. We cannot assure that our portfolio of properties will expand at all, or if it will expand at any specified rate or to any specified size. As part of our overall growth strategy, we regularly review acquisition, financing and redevelopment opportunities, and we expect to continue to pursue investments that we believe will benefit our financial performance. We cannot assure that investment opportunities which meet our investment criteria will be available. Pursuing our investment opportunities may result in additional debt or new equity issuances, that may initially be dilutive to our net income, and such investments may not perform as we expect or produce the returns that we anticipate (including, without limitation, as a result of tenant bankruptcies, tenant concessions, our inability to collect rents and higher than anticipated operating expenses). Further, we may not be able to successfully integrate investments into our existing portfolio without operating disruptions or unanticipated costs. To the extent that our current sources of liquidity are not sufficient to fund such investments, we will require other sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Additionally, to the extent that we increase the size of our portfolio, we may not be able to adapt our management, administrative, accounting and operational systems, or hire and retain sufficient operational staff to integrate investments into our portfolio or manage any future investments without operating disruptions or unanticipated costs. Moreover, our continued growth will require increased investment in management personnel, professional fees, other personnel, financial and management systems and controls and facilities, which will result in additional operating expenses. Under the circumstances described above, our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects may be materially adversely affected.We expect to acquire new properties and this may create risks.We may acquire properties when we believe that an acquisition matches our business and investment strategies. These properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential. It is possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline after we acquire them, or that they may not perform as expected. Further, if financed by additional debt or new equity issuances, our acquisition of properties may result in stockholder dilution. Our acquisition of properties will expose us to the liabilities of those properties, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of such acquisitions. We face competition in pursuing these acquisitions and we may not succeed in leasing acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of their acquisition and operations.Newly acquired properties may require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. We may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions. Consequences arising from or in connection with any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.We are pursuing redevelopment opportunities and this creates risks to our Company.We have commenced a program to redevelop certain of our properties, and to recapture select properties from our net lease portfolio in order to redevelop such properties, for either a new convenience and gasoline use or for alternative single tenant net lease retail uses. The success at each stage of our redevelopment program is dependent on numerous factors and risks, including our ability to identify and extract qualified sites from our portfolio and successfully prepare and market them for alternative uses, and project development issues, including those relating to planning, zoning, licensing, permitting, third party and governmental authorizations, changes in local market conditions, increases in construction costs, the availability and cost of financing, and issues arising from possible discovery of new environmental contamination and the need to conduct environmental remediation. Occupancy rates and rents at any particular redeveloped property may fail to meet our original expectations for reasons beyond our control, including changes in market and economic conditions and the development by competitors of competing properties. We could experience increased and unexpected costs or significant delays or abandonment of some or all of these redevelopment opportunities. For any of the above-described reasons, and others, we may determine to abandon opportunities that we have already begun to explore or with respect to which we have commenced redevelopment efforts and, as a result, we may fail to recover expenses already incurred. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully redevelop and lease any of our identified opportunities or that our overall 20 redevelopment program will be successful. Consequences arising from or in connection with any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.Risks Related to Our Status as a REITFailure to qualify as a REIT under the federal income tax laws would have adverse consequences to our stockholders. Uncertain tax matters may have a significant impact on the results of operations for any single fiscal year or interim period or may cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT.We elected to be treated as a REIT under the federal income tax laws beginning January 1, 2001. To qualify for taxation as a REIT, we must, among other requirements such as those related to the composition of our assets and gross income, distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income, including taxable income that is accrued by us without a corresponding receipt of cash. Accordingly, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on qualifying REIT income, provided that distributions to our stockholders equal at least the amount of our taxable income as defined under the Internal Revenue Code. But, we may have to borrow money or sell assets to satisfy such distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. Many of the REIT requirements are highly technical and complex. If we were to fail to meet the requirements, we may be subject to federal income tax, excise taxes, penalties and interest or we may have to pay a deficiency dividend. We may have to borrow money or sell assets to pay such a deficiency dividend.We cannot guarantee that we will continue to qualify in the future as a REIT. We cannot give any assurance that new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the requirements relating to our qualification. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and will again be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates, we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax for taxable years beginning before 2019, we could be required to pay significant income taxes and we would have less money available for our operations and distributions to stockholders. This would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities. We could also be precluded from treatment as a REIT for four taxable years following the year in which we lost the qualification, and all distributions to stockholders would be taxable as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Loss of our REIT status could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.The U.S. federal income tax treatment of the cash that we might receive from cash settlement of a forward sale agreement under our ATM program is unclear and could jeopardize our ability to meet the REIT qualification requirements.In the event that we elect to settle any forward sale agreement for cash and the settlement price is below the applicable forward sale price, we would be entitled to receive a cash payment from the relevant Forward Purchaser. Under Section 1032 of the Code, generally, no gains and losses are recognized by a corporation in dealing in its own shares, including pursuant to a “securities futures contract,” as defined in the Code by reference to the Exchange Act. Although we believe that any amount received by us in exchange for our stock would qualify for the exemption under Section 1032 of the Code, because it is not entirely clear whether a forward sale agreement qualifies as a “securities futures contract,” the U.S. federal income tax treatment of any cash settlement payment we receive is uncertain. In the event that we recognize a significant gain from the cash settlement of a forward sale agreement, we might not be able to satisfy the gross income requirements applicable to REITs under the Code. In that case, we may be able to rely upon the relief provisions under the Code in order to avoid the loss of our REIT status. Even if the relief provisions apply, we will be subject to a 100% tax on the greater of (i) the excess of 75% of our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) over the amount of such income attributable to sources that qualify under the 75% test or (ii) the excess of 95% of our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) over the amount of such gross income attributable to sources that qualify under the 95% test, multiplied in either case by a fraction intended to reflect our profitability. In the event that these relief provisions were not available, we could lose our REIT status under the Code.There is a risk of changes in the tax law applicable to real estate investment trusts.Because the IRS, the United States Treasury Department and Congress frequently review federal income tax legislation, we cannot predict whether, when or to what extent new federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be adopted. Any of such legislative actions may prospectively or retroactively modify our tax treatment and, therefore, may adversely affect taxation of us and/or our investors.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the TCJA, as amended by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. businesses and their owners, including REITs and their shareholders. Changes made by the TCJA and the CARES Act that could affect us and our shareholders include: •temporarily reducing individual U.S. federal income tax rates on ordinary income; the highest individual U.S. federal income tax rate has been reduced from 39.6% to 37% for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026;21  •permanently eliminating the progressive corporate tax rate structure, with a maximum corporate tax rate of 35%, and replacing it with a flat corporate tax rate of 21%; •permitting a deduction for certain pass-through business income, including dividends received by our shareholders from us that are not designated by us as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income, which will generally allow individuals, trusts, and estates to deduct up to 20% of such amounts for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026; •reducing the highest rate of withholding with respect to our distributions to non-U.S. stockholders that are treated as attributable to gains from the sale or exchange of U.S. real property interests from 35% to 21%; •limiting our deduction for net operating losses to 80% of REIT taxable income (prior to the application of the dividends paid deduction) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020; •generally limiting the deduction for net business interest expense in excess of a specified percentage (50% for taxable years beginning in 2019 and 2020 and 30% for subsequent taxable years) of a business’s adjusted taxable income except for taxpayers that engage in certain real estate businesses and elect out of this rule (provided that such electing taxpayers must use an alternative depreciation system for certain property); and •eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax.You are urged to consult with your tax advisor with respect to the status of legislative, regulatory, judicial or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our securities.U.S. federal tax reform legislation could affect REITs generally, our tenants, the markets in which we operate, the price of our common stock and our results of operations, in ways, both positively and negatively, that are difficult to predict.Certain federal tax legislation more specifically described above (the “2017 Legislation”) included significant changes to corporate and individual tax rates and the calculation of taxes. As a REIT, we are generally not required to pay federal taxes otherwise applicable to regular corporations if we distribute all of our income and comply with the various tax rules governing REITs. Stockholders, however, are generally required to pay taxes on REIT dividends. The 2017 Legislation changed the way in which dividends paid on our stock are taxed by the holder of that stock and could impact the price of our common stock or how stockholders and potential investors view an investment in REITs. In addition, while certain elements of the 2017 Legislation do not impact us directly as a REIT, they could impact our tenants and the markets in which we operate in ways, both positive and negative, that are difficult to predict. Prospective stockholders are urged to consult with their tax advisors with respect to the 2017 Legislation and any other regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and the potential effects thereof on an investment in our common stock.In order to preserve our REIT status, our charter limits the number of shares a person may own, which may discourage a takeover that could result in a premium price for our common stock or otherwise benefit our stockholders.Our charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our Board of Directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Unless exempted by our Board of Directors, no person may (i) own, or be deemed to own by virtue of certain constructive ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, in excess of 5.0% (in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our common stock or (ii) own, or be deemed to own by virtue of certain other constructive ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, in excess of 9.9% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding shares of our common stock, which may discourage large investors from purchasing our stock. This restriction may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all of our assets) that might provide a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders.Risks Related to Ownership of Our SecuritiesChanges in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded common stock.As with other publicly traded securities, the market price of our publicly traded common stock depends on various market conditions, which may change from time-to-time. Among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded common stock are the following: our financial condition and performance and that of our significant tenants; the market’s perception of our growth potential and potential future earnings; the reputation of REITs generally and the reputation of REITs with portfolios similar to us; the attractiveness of the securities of REITs in comparison to securities issued by other entities (including securities issued by other real estate companies); an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher 22 distribution rate in relation to the price paid for publicly traded securities; the extent of institutional investor interest in us; and general economic and financial market conditions.We may change our dividend policy and the dividends we pay may be subject to significant volatility.The decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon such factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant and the dividend paid may vary from expected amounts. Any change in our dividend policy could adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock. In addition, each of the Second Restated Credit Agreement and senior unsecured notes prohibit the payments of dividends during certain events of default. No assurance can be given that our financial performance in the future will permit our payment of any dividends or that the amount of dividends we pay, if any, will not fluctuate significantly. Under the Maryland General Corporation Law (“MGCL”), our ability to pay dividends would be restricted if, after payment of the dividend, (i) we would not be able to pay indebtedness as it becomes due in the usual course of business or (ii) our total assets would be less than the sum of our liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if we were to be dissolved, to satisfy the rights of any stockholders with liquidation preferences. There currently are no stockholders with liquidation preferences. No assurance can be given that our financial performance in the future will permit our payment of any dividends. Each of the Second Restated Credit Agreement our senior unsecured notes contain customary financial covenants such as availability, leverage and coverage ratios and minimum tangible net worth, as well as limitations on restricted payments, which may limit our ability to incur additional debt or pay dividends. As a result of the factors described above, we may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis, which could materially and adversely affect our business, stock price and ability to pay dividends.Future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our equity securities.Our future growth depends upon our ability to raise additional capital. If we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities, such issuance, the receipt of the net proceeds thereof and the use of such proceeds may have a dilutive effect on our expected earnings per share, funds from operations per share and adjusted funds from operations per share. The actual amount of such dilution cannot be determined at this time and will be based on numerous factors. Additionally, we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or preferred stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities in the future. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market after an offering or the perception that such sales could occur.Provisions contained in a forward sale agreement under our ATM Program could result in substantial dilution to our earnings per share and return on equity or result in substantial cash payment obligations.If we enter into one or more forward sale agreements in connection with the ATM Program, the relevant Forward Purchaser (as defined in such forward sale agreement) will have the right to accelerate its forward sale agreement (with respect to all or any portion of the transaction under such forward sale agreement that the Forward Purchaser determines is affected by an event described below) and require us to physically settle on a date specified by such Forward Purchaser if: •in such Forward Purchaser’s good faith, commercially reasonable judgment, it or its affiliate (x) is unable to hedge its exposure under such forward sale agreement because an insufficient number of shares of our common stock have been made available for borrowing by securities lenders or (y) would incur a stock loan cost in excess of a specified threshold to hedge its exposure under such forward sale agreement; •we declare any dividend, issue or distribution on shares of our common stock (a) payable in cash in excess of specified amounts (unless it is an extraordinary dividend), (b) payable in securities of another company that we acquire or own (directly or indirectly) as a result of a spin-off or similar transaction, or (c) payable in any other type of securities (other than shares of our common stock), rights, warrants or other assets for payment at less than the prevailing market price; •certain ownership thresholds applicable to such Forward Purchaser and its affiliates are exceeded; •an event is announced that if consummated would result in a specified extraordinary event (including certain mergers or tender offers, as well as certain events involving our nationalization, or insolvency, or a delisting of shares of our common stock) or the occurrence of a change in law under such forward sale agreement; or •certain other events of default or termination events occur, including, among others, any material misrepresentation made in connection with such forward sale agreement (each as more fully described in each forward sale agreement).A Forward Purchaser’s decision to exercise its right to accelerate the physical settlement of any forward sale agreement and require us to physically settle on a date specified by such Forward Purchaser will be made irrespective of our interests, including our 23 need for capital. In such cases, we could be required to issue and deliver shares of shares of our common stock under the physical settlement provisions of the applicable forward sale agreement, irrespective of our capital needs, which would result in dilution to our earnings per share and return on equity.We expect that settlement of any forward sale agreement will generally occur no later than the date specified in the particular forward sale agreement, which will be no earlier than three months or later than two years following the trade date of that forward sale agreement. However, any forward sale agreement may be settled earlier than that specified date in whole or in part at our option. Subject to certain conditions, we have the right to elect physical, cash or net share settlement under each forward sale agreement. We intend to physically settle each forward sale agreement by delivery of shares of our common stock. However, we may elect to cash settle or net share settle such forward sale agreement. Delivery of shares of our common stock upon physical settlement (or, if we elect net share settlement of a particular forward sale agreement, upon such settlement to the extent we are obligated to deliver shares of our common stock) will result in dilution to our earnings per share and return on equity. If we elect cash settlement or net share settlement with respect to all or a portion of the shares of common stock underlying a particular forward sale agreement, we expect the applicable Forward Purchaser (or an affiliate thereof) to purchase a number of shares of our common stock in secondary market transactions over an unwind period to: •return shares of our common stock to securities lenders in order to unwind such Forward Purchaser’s hedge (after taking into consideration any shares of our common stock to be delivered by us to such Forward Purchaser, in the case of net share settlement); and •if applicable, in the case of net share settlement, deliver shares of our common stock to us to the extent required in settlement of such forward sale agreement.The purchase of shares of our common stock in connection with a Forward Purchaser or its affiliate unwinding such Forward Purchaser’s hedge positions could cause the price of shares of our common stock to increase over such time (or prevent a decrease over such time), thereby increasing the amount of cash we would owe to such Forward Purchaser (or decreasing the amount of cash that such Forward Purchaser would owe to us) upon a cash settlement of the relevant forward sale agreement or increasing the number of shares of our common stock we would deliver to such Forward Purchaser (or decreasing the number of shares of our common stock that such Forward Purchaser would deliver to us) upon net share settlement of the relevant forward sale agreement.The forward sale price that we expect to receive upon physical settlement of a particular forward sale agreement will be subject to adjustment on a daily basis based on a floating interest rate factor equal to the overnight bank rate less a spread and will be decreased based on amounts related to expected dividends on shares of our common stock during the term of the applicable forward sale agreement. If the overnight bank rate is less than the spread for a particular forward sale agreement on any day, the interest factor will result in a daily reduction of the applicable forward sale price. If the volume-weighted average price at which a particular Forward Purchaser (or its affiliate) is able to purchase (or is deemed able to purchase) shares during the applicable unwind period under a particular forward sale agreement is above the relevant forward sale price, in the case of cash settlement, we would pay the relevant Forward Purchaser under such forward sale agreement an amount in cash equal to the difference or, in the case of net share settlement, we would deliver to such Forward Purchaser a number of shares of our common stock having a value equal to the difference. Thus, we could be responsible for a potentially substantial cash payment in the case of cash settlement. If the volume-weighted average price at which a particular Forward Purchaser (or its affiliate) is able to purchase (or is deemed able to purchase) shares during the applicable unwind period under that particular forward sale agreement is below the relevant forward sale price, in the case of cash settlement, we would be paid the difference in cash by the relevant Forward Purchaser under that particular forward sale agreement or, in the case of net share settlement, we would receive from such Forward Purchaser a number of shares of our common stock having a value equal to the difference. In case of our bankruptcy or insolvency, any forward sale agreement under our ATM Program that is in effect will automatically terminate, and we would not receive the expected proceeds from any forward sales of shares of our common stock.If we or a regulatory authority with jurisdiction over us institutes, or we consent to, a proceeding seeking a judgment in bankruptcy or insolvency or any other relief under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or other similar law affecting creditors’ rights, or we or a regulatory authority with jurisdiction over us presents a petition for our winding-up or liquidation, or we consent to such a petition, any forward sale agreement that is then in effect will automatically terminate. If any such forward sale agreement so terminates under these circumstances, we would not be obligated to deliver to the relevant Forward Purchaser any shares of common stock not previously delivered, and the relevant Forward Purchaser would be discharged from its obligation to pay the applicable forward sale price per share in respect of any shares of common stock not previously settled under the applicable forward sale agreement. Therefore, to the extent that there are any shares of common stock with respect to which any forward sale agreement has not been settled at the time of the commencement of any such bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, we would not receive the relevant forward sale price per share in respect of those shares of common stock.24 Maryland law may discourage a third-party from acquiring us.We are subject to the provisions of the Maryland Business Combination Act (the “Business Combination Act”) which prohibits transactions between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Generally, pursuant to the Business Combination Act, an “interested stockholder” is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of a Maryland corporation’s voting stock. These provisions could have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of our Company or reducing the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our capital stock. Additionally, the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act may deny voting rights to shares involved in an acquisition of one-tenth or more of the voting stock of a Maryland corporation. In our charter and bylaws, we have elected not to have the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act apply to any acquisition by any person of shares of stock of our Company. However, in the case of the control share acquisition statute, our Board of Directors may opt to make this statute applicable to us at any time by amending our bylaws, and may do so on a retroactive basis. Finally, the “unsolicited takeovers” provisions of the MGCL permit our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to implement certain provisions that may have the effect of inhibiting a third-party from making an acquisition proposal for our Company or of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our Company under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price or that stockholders may otherwise believe is in their best interests; however, on February 23, 2022, our Board of Directors adopted a resolution prohibiting us from electing to be subject to the classified board provisions of Section 3-803 of the MGCL, unless such election is first approved by the stockholders of the Corporation by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast on the matter by stockholders entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.               "
1,GTY,GETTY REALTY CORP,2021-02-25,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
We are subject to various risks, many of which are beyond our control. As a result of these and other factors, we may experience material fluctuations in our future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. An investment in our stock involves various risks, including those mentioned below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and those that are described from time to time in our other filings with the SEC.Summary of Risk Factors
Our business is subject to risks and uncertainties, including those risks and uncertainties discussed at-length below, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following:Risks Related to Our Business and Operations •The risks inherent in owning or leasing real estate.  •The real estate industry is highly competitive.  •Our future cash flow is dependent on the performance of our tenants of their lease obligations, renewal of existing leases and either re-leasing or selling our properties. •Substantially all of our tenants depend on the same industry for their revenues.  •It may be difficult for our investors to determine the creditworthiness of our tenants. •An increase in costs and liability accruals as a result of environmental laws and regulations could adversely affect our business.  •We are defending pending lawsuits and claims that may subject us to material losses. 8   •We may be subject to losses that may not be covered by insurance.  •The concentration of a significant number of our properties in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, and adverse conditions in those regions, in particular, could negatively impact our operations. •Property taxes on our properties may increase without notice.  •Our business operations may not generate sufficient cash for distributions or debt service. •Adverse developments in general business, economic or political conditions could have a material adverse effect on us. •Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the market on which our common stock trades, the markets in which we operate, our operations and our results of operations. •Our exposure to counterparty risk. •Inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. •Our assets may be subject to impairment charges.  •Our accounting policies and methods require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. •Amendments to the Accounting Standards Codification made by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) or changes in accounting standards may adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability or financial position. •If we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately and timely report our financial results. •Our reliance on certain members of our management team or Board of Directors, the loss of any one of which could adversely affect our business or the market price of our common stock.  •Our reliance on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business. •Our business and results of operations have been, and our financial condition may be, impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.Risks Related to Financing Our Business •Our dependency on external sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.  •Interest rate risk and our ability to manage or mitigate this risk effectively.  •Adverse effects by changes in LIBOR reporting practices or the method in which LIBOR is calculated.Risks Related to Our Investment Strategy •We may not be able to successfully implement our investment strategy.  •We expect to acquire new properties and this may create risks.  •We are pursuing redevelopment opportunities and this creates risks to our Company. 9  Risks Related to Our Status as a REIT •The failure to qualify as a REIT under the federal income tax laws would have adverse consequences to our stockholders. Uncertain tax matters may have a significant impact on the results of operations for any single fiscal year or interim period or may cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT. •A risk of changes in the tax law applicable to REITs. •U.S. federal tax reform legislation could affect REITs generally, our tenants, the markets in which we operate, the price of our common stock and our results of operations. •In order to preserve our REIT status, our charter limits the number of shares a person may own, which may discourage a takeover that could result in a premium price for our common stock or otherwise benefit our stockholders.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Securities •Changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded common stock. •Changes in our dividend policy and the dividends we pay may be subject to significant volatility. •Future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our equity securities. •Maryland law may discourage a third-party from acquiring us.Risks Related to Our Business and OperationsWe are subject to risks inherent in owning and leasing real estate.We are subject to varying degrees of risk generally related to leasing and owning real estate, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to general risks applicable to us, our risks include, among others: our liability as a lessee for long-term lease obligations regardless of our revenues; deterioration in national, regional and local economic and real estate market conditions; potential changes in supply of, or demand for, rental properties similar to ours; competition for tenants and declining rental rates; difficulty in selling or re-leasing properties on favorable terms or at all; impairments in our ability to collect rent or other payments due to us when they are due; increases in interest rates and adverse changes in the availability, cost and terms of financing; uninsured property liability; the impact of present or future environmental legislation and compliance with environmental laws; adverse changes in zoning laws and other regulations; acts of terrorism and war; acts of God; the unforeseen impacts of climate change, compliance with any future laws or regulations designed to prevent or mitigate the impacts of climate change, and any material costs related thereto; the potential risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time the need to periodically renovate and repair our properties; and physical or weather-related damage to our properties. Certain significant expenditures generally do not change in response to economic or other conditions, including: (i) debt service, (ii) real estate taxes, (iii) environmental remediation costs and (iv) operating and maintenance costs. The combination of variable revenue and relatively fixed expenditures may result, under certain market conditions, in reduced earnings and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.Each of the factors listed above could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. In addition, real estate investments are relatively illiquid, which means that our ability to vary our portfolio of properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be limited.We are in a competitive business.The real estate industry is highly competitive. Where we own properties, we compete for tenants with a large number of real estate property owners and other companies that sublet properties. Our principal means of competition are rents we are able to charge in relation to the income producing potential of the location. In addition, we expect other major real estate investors, some with much greater financial resources or more experienced personnel than we have, will compete with us for attractive acquisition opportunities. These competitors include petroleum manufacturing, distributing and marketing companies, convenience store retailers, other REITs, public and private investment funds, and other individual and institutional investors. This competition has increased prices for properties we seek to acquire and may impair our ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms in the future.10 Our future cash flow is dependent on the performance of our tenants of their lease obligations, renewal of existing leases and either re-leasing or selling our properties.We are subject to risks that financial distress, default or bankruptcy of our tenants may lead to vacancy at our properties or disruption in rent receipts as a result of partial payment or nonpayment of rent or that expiring leases may not be renewed. Under unfavorable general economic conditions, there can be no assurance that our tenants’ level of sales and financial performance generally will not be adversely affected, which in turn could negatively impact our rental revenues. We are subject to risks that the terms governing renewal or re-leasing of our properties (including, compliance with numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment, such as the remediation of contamination and the retirement and decommissioning or removal of long-lived assets, the cost of required renovations, or replacement of USTs and related equipment) may be less favorable than current lease terms.We are also subject to the risk that we may receive less net proceeds from the properties we sell as compared to their current carrying value or that the value of our properties may be adversely affected by unfavorable general economic conditions. Unfavorable general economic conditions may also negatively impact our ability to re-lease or sell our properties. Numerous properties compete with our properties in attracting tenants to lease space. The number of available or competitive properties in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease or sell our properties and on the rents we are able to charge. In addition to the risk of disruption in rent receipts, we are subject to the risk of incurring real estate taxes, maintenance, environmental and other expenses at vacant properties. The financial distress, default or bankruptcy of our tenants may also lead to protracted and expensive processes for retaking control of our properties than would otherwise be the case, including, eviction or other legal proceedings related to or resulting from the tenant’s default. These risks are greater with respect to certain of our tenants who lease multiple properties from us. If a tenant files for bankruptcy protection it is possible that we would recover substantially less than the full value of our claims against the tenant. If (i) our tenants do not perform their lease obligations, (ii) we are unable to renew existing leases and promptly recapture and re-lease or sell our properties, (iii) lease terms upon renewal or re-leasing are less favorable than current or historical lease terms, (iv) the values of properties that we sell are adversely affected by market conditions, or (v) we incur significant costs or disruption related to or resulting from tenant financial distress, default or bankruptcy, then our cash flow could be significantly adversely affected.Substantially all of our tenants depend on the same industry for their revenues.We derive substantially all of our revenues from leasing, primarily on a triple-net basis, and financing convenience store and gasoline station properties to tenants in the petroleum marketing industry. Accordingly, our revenues are substantially dependent on the economic success of the petroleum marketing industry, and any factors that adversely affect that industry, such as disruption in the supply of petroleum or a decrease in the demand for conventional motor fuels due to conservation, technological advancements in petroleum-fueled motor vehicles or an increase in the use of, and consumer demand for, alternative fuel, electric and battery-operated vehicles, or other “green technologies,” could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. The success of participants in the petroleum marketing industry depends upon the sale of refined petroleum products at margins in excess of fixed and variable expenses. The petroleum marketing industry is highly competitive and volatile. Petroleum products are commodities, the prices of which depend on numerous factors that affect supply and demand. The prices paid by our tenants and other petroleum marketers for products are affected by global, national and regional factors. A large, rapid increase in wholesale petroleum prices would adversely affect the profitability and cash flows of our tenants if the increased cost of petroleum products could not be passed on to their customers or if automobile consumption of gasoline was to decline significantly. We cannot be certain as to how these factors will affect petroleum product prices or supply in the future, or how in particular they will affect our tenants.Because certain of our tenants are not rated and their financial information is not available to you, it may be difficult for our investors to determine their creditworthiness.The majority of our properties are leased to tenants who are not rated by any nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. In addition, our tenants’ financial information is not generally available to our investors. Additionally, many of our tenants are part of larger corporate organizations and we do not receive financial information for the other entities in those organizations. The financial distress of other affiliated companies or businesses in those organizations may negatively impact the ability or willingness of our tenant to perform its obligations under its lease with us. Because of the lack of financial information or credit ratings it is, therefore, difficult for our investors to assess the creditworthiness of our tenants and to determine the ability of our tenants to meet their obligations to us. It is possible that the assumptions and estimates we make after reviewing publicly and privately obtained information about our tenants are not accurate and that we may be required to increase reserves for bad debts, record allowances for deferred rent receivable or record additional expenses if our tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations to us.11 We incur significant operating costs and, from time to time, may have significant liability accruals as a result of environmental laws and regulations, which costs and accruals could significantly increase, and reduce our profitability or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, including matters relating to the protection of the environment. Under certain environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at, on, or under, such property, and may be required to investigate and clean-up such contamination. Such laws typically impose liability and clean-up responsibility first on the party responsible for the contamination, but can also impose liability and clean-up responsibility on the owner and the current operator without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants, or the timing or cause of the contamination. Liability under such environmental laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility and the financial resources are available to perform the remediation. For example, liability may arise as a result of the historical use of a property or from the migration of contamination from adjacent or nearby properties. Any such contamination or liability may also reduce the value of the property. In addition, the owner or operator of a property may be subject to claims by third-parties based on injury, damage and/or costs, including investigation and clean-up costs, resulting from environmental contamination present at or emanating from a property. We cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations may be enacted in the future, or how existing laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted with respect to products or activities to which they have not previously been applied. Additionally, compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of the regulatory agencies or stricter interpretation of existing laws, which may develop in the future, could have an adverse effect on our financial position, or that of our tenants, and could require substantial additional expenditures for future remediation. Accordingly, compliance with environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.The properties owned or controlled by us are leased primarily as convenience store and gasoline station properties, and therefore may contain, or may have contained, USTs for the storage of petroleum products and other hazardous or toxic substances, which creates a potential for the release of such products or substances. Some of our properties are subject to regulations regarding the retirement and decommissioning or removal of long-lived assets including buildings containing hazardous materials, USTs and other equipment. Some of the properties may be adjacent to or near properties that have contained or currently contain USTs used to store petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, certain of the properties are on, adjacent to, or near properties upon which others have engaged or may in the future engage in activities that may release petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. There may be other environmental problems associated with our properties of which we are unaware. These problems may make it more difficult for us to re-lease or sell our properties on favorable terms, or at all.We enter into leases and various other agreements which contractually allocate responsibility between the parties for known and unknown environmental liabilities at or relating to the subject properties. We are contingently liable for these environmental obligations in the event that our tenant does not satisfy them, and we are required to accrue for environmental liabilities that we believe are allocable to others under our leases if we determine that it is probable that our tenant will not meet its environmental obligations. It is possible that our assumptions regarding the ultimate allocation method and share of responsibility that we used to allocate environmental liabilities may change, which may result in material adjustments to the amounts recorded for environmental litigation accruals and environmental remediation liabilities. We assess whether to accrue for environmental liabilities based upon relevant factors including our tenants’ histories of paying for such obligations, our assessment of their financial capability, and their intent to pay for such obligations. However, there can be no assurance that our assessments are correct or that our tenants who have paid their obligations in the past will continue to do so. We may ultimately be responsible to pay for environmental liabilities as the property owner if our tenant fails to pay them. The ultimate resolution of these matters could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.For substantially all of our triple-net leases, our tenants are contractually responsible for compliance with environmental laws and regulations, removal of USTs at the end of their lease term (the cost of which in certain cases is partially borne by us) and remediation of any environmental contamination that arises during the term of their tenancy. Under the terms of our leases covering properties previously leased to Marketing (substantially all of which commenced in 2012), we have agreed to be responsible for environmental contamination at the premises that was known at the time the lease commenced, and for environmental contamination which existed prior to commencement of the lease and is discovered (other than as a result of a voluntary site investigation) during the first 10 years of the lease term (or a shorter period for a minority of such leases). After expiration of such 10-year (or, in certain cases, shorter) period, responsibility for all newly discovered contamination, even if it relates to periods prior to commencement of the lease, is contractually allocated to our tenant. Our tenants at properties previously leased to Marketing are in all cases responsible for the cost of any remediation of contamination that results from their use and occupancy of our properties. Under substantially all of our other triple-net leases, responsibility for remediation of all environmental contamination discovered during the term of the lease (including known and unknown contamination that existed prior to commencement of the lease) is the responsibility of our tenant.We anticipate that a majority of the USTs at properties previously leased to Marketing will be replaced over the next several years because these USTs are either at or near the end of their useful lives. For long-term, triple-net leases covering sites previously 12 leased to Marketing, our tenants are responsible for the cost of removal and replacement of USTs and for remediation of contamination found during such UST removal and replacement, unless such contamination was found during the first 10 years of the lease term and also existed prior to commencement of the lease. In those cases, we are responsible for costs associated with the remediation of such preexisting contamination. We have also agreed to be responsible for environmental contamination that existed prior to the sale of certain properties assuming the contamination is discovered (other than as a result of a voluntary site investigation) during the first five years after the sale of the properties.In the course of certain UST removals and replacements at properties previously leased to Marketing where we retained continuing responsibility for preexisting environmental obligations, previously unknown environmental contamination was and continues to be discovered. As a result, we have developed an estimate of fair value for the prospective future environmental liability resulting from preexisting unknown environmental contamination and have accrued for these estimated costs. These estimates are based primarily upon quantifiable trends which we believe allow us to make reasonable estimates of fair value for the future costs of environmental remediation resulting from the removal and replacement of USTs. Our accrual of the additional liability represents our estimate of the fair value of cost for each component of the liability, net of estimated recoveries from state UST remediation funds considering estimated recovery rates developed from prior experience with the funds. In arriving at our accrual, we analyzed the ages of USTs at properties where we would be responsible for preexisting contamination found within 10 years after commencement of a lease (for properties subject to long-term triple-net leases) or five years from a sale (for divested properties), and projected a cost to closure for preexisting unknown environmental contamination.We measure our environmental remediation liabilities at fair value based on expected future net cash flows, adjusted for inflation, and then discount them to present value. We adjust our environmental remediation liabilities quarterly to reflect changes in projected expenditures, changes in present value due to the passage of time and reductions in estimated liabilities as a result of actual expenditures incurred during each quarter. As of December 31, 2020, we had accrued a total of $48.1 million for our prospective environmental remediation obligations. This accrual consisted of (a) $11.7 million, which was our estimate of reasonably estimable environmental remediation liability, including obligations to remove USTs for which we are responsible, net of estimated recoveries and (b) $36.4 million for future environmental liabilities related to preexisting unknown contamination.For additional information regarding pending environmental lawsuits and claims, and environmental remediation obligations and estimates, see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings”, “Environmental Matters” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Notes 3 and 5 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K.Environmental exposures are difficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons, including the amount of data available upon initial assessment of contamination, alternative treatment methods that may be applied, location of the property which subjects it to differing local laws and regulations and their interpretations, changes in costs associated with environmental remediation services and equipment, the availability of state UST remediation funds and the possibility of existing legal claims giving rise to allocation of responsibilities to others, as well as the time it takes to remediate contamination and receive regulatory approval. In developing our liability for estimated environmental remediation obligations on a property by property basis, we consider, among other things, laws and regulations, assessments of contamination and surrounding geology, quality of information available, currently available technologies for treatment, alternative methods of remediation and prior experience. Environmental accruals are based on estimates derived upon facts known to us at this time, which are subject to significant change as circumstances change, and as environmental contingencies become more clearly defined and reasonably estimable.We cannot predict if state UST fund programs will be administered and funded in the future in a manner that is consistent with past practices and if future environmental spending will continue to be eligible for reimbursement at historical recovery rates under these programs. As a result, our estimates in respect of recoveries from state UST remediation funds could change, which could adversely affect our accruals for environmental remediation liabilities.Any changes to our estimates or our assumptions that form the basis of our estimates may result in our providing an accrual, or adjustments to the amounts recorded, for environmental remediation liabilities. Additional environmental liabilities could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.We are defending pending lawsuits and claims and are subject to material losses.We are subject to various lawsuits and claims, including litigation related to environmental matters, such as those arising from leaking USTs, contamination of groundwater with methyl tertiary butyl ether (a fuel derived from methanol, commonly referred to as “MTBE”) and releases of motor fuel into the environment, and toxic tort claims. The ultimate resolution of certain matters cannot be predicted because considerable uncertainty exists both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimate of such loss. Our ultimate liabilities resulting from the lawsuits and claims we face could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. For additional information with respect to certain pending lawsuits and claims, see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” and Note 3 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K.13 We are subject to losses that may not be covered by insurance.We and our tenants carry insurance against certain risks and in such amounts as we believe are customary for businesses of our kind. However, as the costs and availability of insurance change, we may decide not to be covered against certain losses (such as certain environmental liabilities, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and civil disorder) where, in the judgment of management, the insurance is not warranted due to cost or availability of coverage or the remoteness of perceived risk. Furthermore, there are certain types of losses, such as losses resulting from wars, terrorism or certain acts of God, that generally are not insured because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. There is no assurance that the existing insurance coverages are or will be sufficient to cover actual losses incurred. The destruction of, or significant damage to, or significant liabilities arising out of conditions at, our properties due to an uninsured loss would result in an economic loss and could result in us losing both our investment in, and anticipated profits from, such properties. When a loss is insured, the coverage may be insufficient in amount or duration, or a lessee’s customers may be lost, such that the lessee cannot resume its business after the loss at prior levels or at all, resulting in reduced rent or a default under its lease. Any such loss relating to a large number of properties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.A significant portion of our properties are concentrated in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, and adverse conditions in those regions, in particular, could negatively impact our operations.A significant portion of the properties we own and lease are located in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States and, as of December 31, 2020, 43.6% of our properties are concentrated in three states (New York, Massachusetts and Connecticut). Because of the concentration of our properties in those regions, in the event of adverse economic conditions in those regions, we would likely experience higher risk of default on payment of rent to us than if our properties were more geographically diversified. Additionally, the rents on our properties may be subject to a greater risk of default than other properties in the event of adverse economic, political or business developments, natural disasters or severe weather that may affect the Northeast or Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States and the ability of our lessees to make rent payments. This lack of geographical diversification could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.Property taxes on our properties may increase without notice.Each of the properties we own or lease is subject to real property taxes. The leases for certain of the properties that we lease from third-parties obligate us to pay real property taxes with regard to those properties. The real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we acquire or lease in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities. To the extent that our tenants are unable or unwilling to pay such increase in accordance with their leases, our net operating expenses may increase.Our business operations may not generate sufficient cash for distributions or debt service.There is no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay dividends on our common stock, to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may not be able to repay or refinance existing indebtedness on favorable terms, which could force us to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms (which may also result in losses) or accept financing on unfavorable terms.Adverse developments in general business, economic or political conditions could have a material adverse effect on us.Adverse developments in general business and economic conditions, including through recession, downturn or otherwise, either in the economy generally or in those regions in which a large portion of our business is conducted, could have a material adverse effect on us and significantly increase certain of the risks we are subject to. Among other effects, adverse economic conditions could depress real estate values, impact our ability to re-lease or sell our properties and have an adverse effect on our tenants’ level of sales and financial performance generally. As our revenues are substantially dependent on the economic success of our tenants, any factors that adversely impact our tenants could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the market on which our common stock trades, the markets in which we operate, our operations and our results of operations.Terrorist attacks or other acts of violence or war could affect our business or the businesses of our tenants. The consequences of armed conflicts are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. More generally, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States and worldwide financial markets and economy. Terrorist attacks also could be a factor resulting in, or which could exacerbate, an economic recession in the United States or abroad. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.14 We are exposed to counterparty risk and there can be no assurances that we will effectively manage or mitigate this risk.We regularly interact with counterparties in various industries. The types of counterparties most common to our transactions and agreements include, but are not limited to, landlords, tenants, vendors and lenders. We also enter into agreements to acquire and sell properties which allocate responsibility for certain costs to the counterparty. Our most significant counterparties include, but are not limited to, the members of the bank syndicate related to our Restated Credit Agreement, the lenders that are the counterparties to our senior unsecured notes and our major tenants from whom we derive a significant amount of rental revenue. The default, insolvency or other inability or unwillingness of a significant counterparty to perform its obligations under an agreement, including, without limitation, as a result of the rejection of an agreement in bankruptcy proceedings, is likely to have a material adverse effect on us. As of December 31, 2020, we leased 150 convenience store and gasoline station properties in three separate unitary leases and two stand-alone leases to subsidiaries of Global. In the aggregate, our leases with subsidiaries of Global represented 16% and 18% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. All of our unitary leases with subsidiaries of Global are guaranteed by the parent company. As of December 31, 2020, we leased 129 convenience store and gasoline station properties in four separate unitary leases to subsidiaries of Arko. In the aggregate, our leases with subsidiaries of Arko represented 15% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. All of our unitary leases with subsidiaries of Arko are guaranteed by the parent company. As of December 31, 2020, we leased 77 convenience store and gasoline station properties in three separate unitary leases to United Oil. In the aggregate, our leases with United Oil represented 12% and 13% of our total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we leased 74 convenience store and gasoline station properties in two separate unitary leases to subsidiaries of Chestnut. In the aggregate, our leases with subsidiaries of Chestnut represented 10% and 11% of our total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The largest of these unitary leases, covering 56 of our properties, is guaranteed by the parent company, its principals and numerous Chestnut affiliates.We may also undertake additional transactions with these or other existing tenants, which would further concentrate our sources of rental revenues. Many of our tenants, including those noted above, are part of larger corporate organizations and the financial distress of one subsidiary or other affiliated companies or businesses in those organizations may negatively impact the ability or willingness of our tenant to perform its obligations under its lease with us. The failure of a major tenant or their default in their rental and other obligations to us is likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.Inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Although inflation has not materially impacted our results of operations in the recent past, increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations. During times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, as provided for in our leases, rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation. Likewise, even though our triple-net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation, substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue, which may adversely affect our tenants’ ability to pay rent.Our assets may be subject to impairment charges.We periodically evaluate our real estate investments and other assets for impairment indicators. The judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on GAAP, and includes a variety of factors such as market conditions, the accumulation of asset retirement costs due to changes in estimates associated with our estimated environmental liabilities, the status of significant leases, the financial condition of major tenants and other assumptions and factors that could affect the cash flow from or fair value of our properties. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we incurred $4.3 million and $4.0 million, respectively, of impairment charges. We may be required to take similar impairment charges, which could affect the implementation of our current business strategy and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial position and results of operations, and they require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain.Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial position and results of operations. We have identified several accounting policies as being critical to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations because they require management to make particularly subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be recorded under different conditions or using different assumptions. We cannot provide any assurance that we will not make subsequent significant adjustments to our consolidated financial statements. Estimates, judgments and assumptions underlying our consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, receivables and related reserves, deferred rent receivable, income under direct financing leases, asset retirement obligations (including environmental remediation obligations and future environmental liabilities for pre-existing unknown environmental 15 contamination), real estate, depreciation and amortization, carrying value of our properties, impairment of long-lived assets, litigation, accrued liabilities, income taxes and allocation of the purchase price of properties acquired to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If our accounting policies, methods, judgments, assumptions, estimates and allocations prove to be incorrect, or if circumstances change, our business, financial condition, revenues, operating expense, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price may be materially adversely affected.Amendments to the Accounting Standards Codification made by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) or changes in accounting standards issued by other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability or financial position.Our consolidated financial statements are subject to the application of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification, which is periodically amended by the FASB. The application of GAAP is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, we are required to adopt amendments to the Accounting Standards Codification or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time-to-time by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB and the SEC. Those changes could adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability or financial position.If we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately and timely report our financial results.Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, effectively prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. We are required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.As a result of material weaknesses or significant deficiencies that may be identified in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may also identify certain deficiencies in some of our disclosure controls and procedures that we believe require remediation. If we or our independent registered public accounting firm discover any such weaknesses or deficiencies, we will make efforts to further improve our internal control over financial reporting controls. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful. Any failure to maintain effective controls or timely effect any necessary improvement of our internal control over financial reporting controls could harm operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, which could affect the listing of our common stock on the NYSE. Ineffective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the per share trading price of our common stock.The loss of certain members of our management team or Board of Directors could adversely affect our business or the market price of our common stock.Our future success and ability to implement our business and investment strategy depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key management personnel and directors, and on the continued contributions of such persons, each of whom may be difficult to replace. As a REIT, we employ only 31 employees and have a cost-effective management structure. We do not have any employment agreements with any of our executives. In the event of the loss of key management personnel or directors, or upon unexpected death, disability or retirement, we may not be able to find replacements with comparable skill, ability and industry expertise, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. Additionally, certain of our directors beneficially own more than 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If any of these directors cease to be a director of the Company and they or their estate sell a significant portion of such holdings into the public market, it could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.We rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business.We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, including financial transactions and maintenance of records, which may include personal identifying information of tenants and lease data. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting and storing confidential tenant information, such as individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts. Although we have taken steps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems, it is possible that our security measures will not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning, or the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyberattacks. Security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our 16 information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect us.Our business and results of operations have been, and our financial condition may be, impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and such impact could be materially adverse.The global spread of COVID-19 has created significant volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, operations and financial results is uncertain, and will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business and individual actions taken in response to the pandemic and the impact of those actions on global economic activity; the actions taken in response to economic disruption; the reduced economic activity, if not closures from time to time of our tenants’ facilities, may impact our tenants' businesses, financial condition and liquidity, and may cause one or more of our tenants to be unable to meet their obligations to us in full, or at all, or to otherwise seek modifications of such obligations; general decline in business activity and demand for real estate transactions could adversely affect our ability or desire to grow our portfolio of properties; the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively impact our future compliance with financial covenants of our Restated Credit Agreement and our senior unsecured notes and result in a default and potentially an acceleration of indebtedness, which non-compliance could negatively impact our ability to make additional borrowings under our Revolving Facility and pay dividends; and a deterioration in our or our tenants’ ability to operate in affected areas or delays in the supply of products or services to us or our tenants from vendors that are needed for our or our tenants’ efficient operations could adversely affect our operations and those of our tenants.We have granted a small number of tenants short-term rent or mortgage payment relief requests, most of them in the form of deferral of payments. Notwithstanding the granting of such deferrals, certain of our tenants may be unable to make timely rental payments in whole or in part under their leases or may seek further waivers or deferrals of rental payments. Accordingly, the worsening of estimated future cash flows could result in our recognition of increased impairment charges on certain of our properties. Moreover, in the event of any of our tenants default under or seek early termination for their leases, we might not be able to fully recover and/or experience delays and additional costs in enforcing our rights under the terms of our leases due to potential COVID-19-related moratoriums imposed by various jurisdictions on landlord initiated commercial eviction and collection actions. Further, one or more of our tenants may seek the protection of the bankruptcy laws as a result of the prolonged impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could result in the termination of its lease. Tenant bankruptcies may make it more difficult for us to release or redevelop the property or properties in which the bankrupt tenant operates, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.The rapid development and fluidity of this situation precludes any prediction as to the full adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to our performance, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and performance. Moreover, many risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, should be interpreted as heightened risks as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.Risks Related to Financing Our BusinessWe are dependent on external sources of capital which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.We are dependent on external sources of capital to maintain our status as a REIT and must distribute to our stockholders each year at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding any net capital gain. Because of these distribution requirements, it is not likely that we will be able to fund all future capital needs, including acquisitions, from income from operations. Therefore, we will have to continue to rely on third-party sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. We may need to access the capital markets in order to execute future significant acquisitions. There can be no assurance that sources of capital will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.Our principal sources of liquidity are the cash flows from our operations, funds available under our $300.0 million senior unsecured credit agreement (as amended, the “Restated Credit Agreement”), with a group of commercial banks led by Bank of America, N.A., proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock through offerings, from time to time, under our at-the-market program (“ATM Program”) and available cash and cash equivalents. The Restated Credit Agreement consists of a $300.0 million unsecured revolving facility (the “Revolving Facility”), which is scheduled to mature in March 2022. Subject to the terms of the Restated Credit Agreement and our continued compliance with its provisions, we have the option to (a) extend the term of the Revolving Facility for one additional year to March 2023 and (b) request that the lenders approve an increase of up to $300.0 million in the amount of the Revolving Facility to $600.0 million in the aggregate. We have also issued $525.0 million of senior unsecured notes. For additional information, see “Credit Agreement” and “Senior Unsecured Notes” in Note 4 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K.The Restated Credit Agreement and our senior unsecured notes contain customary financial covenants such as leverage, coverage ratios and minimum tangible net worth, as well as limitations on restricted payments, which may limit our ability to incur additional debt or pay dividends. The Restated Credit Agreement and our senior unsecured notes also contain customary events of 17 default, including cross defaults to each other, change of control and failure to maintain REIT status (provided that the senior unsecured notes require a mandatory offer to prepay the notes upon a change in control in lieu of a change of control event of default). Our ability to meet the terms of the agreements is dependent upon our continued ability to meet certain criteria, as further described in Note 4 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K, the performance of our tenants and the other risks described in this section. If we are not in compliance with one or more of our covenants, which could result in an event of default under our Restated Credit Agreement or our senior unsecured notes, there can be no assurance that our lenders would waive such non-compliance. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.Under our ATM Program, we may issue and sell shares of our common stock with an aggregate sales price of up to $125.0 million through a consortium of banks acting as agents. Sales of shares of our common stock under our ATM Program may be made from time to time in at-the-market offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, including by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or as otherwise agreed to with the applicable agent. Sales of shares of our common stock under our ATM Program, if any, will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including among others, market conditions and the trading price of our common stock. Our agents are not required to sell any specific number or dollar amount of our common stock, but each agent will use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices and applicable law and regulation to sell shares designated by us in accordance with the terms of the distribution agreement with our agents. The net proceeds we receive will be the gross proceeds received from such sales less the commissions and any other costs we may incur in issuing the shares of our common stock.We may use a portion of the net proceeds from any of such sales to reduce our outstanding indebtedness, including borrowings under our Revolving Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility includes lenders who are affiliates of our agents. As a result, a portion of the net proceeds from any sale of shares of our common stock under our ATM Program that is used to repay amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility will be received by these affiliates. Because an affiliate may receive a portion of the net proceeds from any of these sales, each of our agents may have an interest in these sales beyond the sales commission it will receive. This could result in a conflict of interest and cause such agents to act in a manner that is not in the best interests of us or our investors in connection with any sale of shares of our common stock under our ATM Program.Our access to third-party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors including general market conditions, the market’s perception of our growth potential, financial stability, our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions, covenants and limitations imposed under our Restated Credit Agreement and our senior unsecured notes, and the market price of our common stock.We are exposed to interest rate risk and there can be no assurances that we will manage or mitigate this risk effectively.We are exposed to interest rate risk, primarily as a result of our Restated Credit Agreement. Borrowings under our Restated Credit Agreement bear interest at a floating rate. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates will increase the amount of interest we must pay under our Restated Credit Agreement. Our interest rate risk may materially change in the future if we increase our borrowings under the Restated Credit Agreement or amend our Restated Credit Agreement or our senior unsecured notes, seek other sources of debt or equity capital or refinance our outstanding indebtedness. A significant increase in interest rates could also make it more difficult to find alternative financing on desirable terms. For additional information with respect to interest rate risk, see “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in this Form 10-K.We may be adversely affected by changes in LIBOR reporting practices or the method in which LIBOR is calculated.On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York convened the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (“ARRC”), a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, to identify an alternative reference rate.  ARRC identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), calculated by reference to short-term repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasury securities, as the recommended alternative reference rate for USD-LIBOR in derivative and other financial contracts and proposed a paced transition plan to transition USD-LIBOR to SOFR.  The first publication of SOFR was released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in April 2018. In November 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (the administrator of LIBOR) announced that it would consult on its intention to cease the publication of the one-week and two-month USD-LIBOR tenors only on December 31, 2021 and all other USD-LIBOR tenors on June 30, 2023.  The consultation period ended on January 25, 2021; however, no official statement has been made as of the date of this report.We cannot predict when LIBOR will cease to be available and there is no guarantee that a transition from LIBOR to an alternative rate will not result in financial market disruptions, significant increases in benchmark rates or financing costs to borrowers.  If LIBOR is discontinued, pursuant to the Second Amendment to the Restated Credit Agreement, the administrative agent and the borrower may amend the Restated Credit Agreement to replace LIBOR with a SOFR-based rate or an alternative rate otherwise agreed upon. Such an event would not affect our ability to borrow or maintain already outstanding borrowings, but the alternative rate could 18 be higher and more volatile than LIBOR prior to its discontinuance.  If a LIBOR successor rate has not been implemented under the Restated Credit Agreement, interest on borrowing shall accrue at the base rate.  Accordingly, the potential effects of the foregoing on our cost of capital cannot yet be determined. As of December 31, 2020, we had $25,000,000 of borrowings based on LIBOR.Risks Related to Our Investment StrategyWe may not be able to successfully implement our investment strategy.We may not be able to successfully implement our investment strategy. We cannot assure you that our portfolio of properties will expand at all, or if it will expand at any specified rate or to any specified size. As part of our overall growth strategy, we regularly review acquisition, financing and redevelopment opportunities, and we expect to continue to pursue investments that we believe will benefit our financial performance. We cannot assure you that investment opportunities which meet our investment criteria will be available. Pursuing our investment opportunities may result in additional debt or new equity issuances, that may initially be dilutive to our net income, and such investments may not perform as we expect or produce the returns that we anticipate (including, without limitation, as a result of tenant bankruptcies, tenant concessions, our inability to collect rents and higher than anticipated operating expenses). Further, we may not be able to successfully integrate investments into our existing portfolio without operating disruptions or unanticipated costs. To the extent that our current sources of liquidity are not sufficient to fund such investments, we will require other sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Additionally, to the extent that we increase the size of our portfolio, we may not be able to adapt our management, administrative, accounting and operational systems, or hire and retain sufficient operational staff to integrate investments into our portfolio or manage any future investments without operating disruptions or unanticipated costs. Moreover, our continued growth will require increased investment in management personnel, professional fees, other personnel, financial and management systems and controls and facilities, which will result in additional operating expenses. Under the circumstances described above, our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects may be materially adversely affected.We expect to acquire new properties and this may create risks.We may acquire properties when we believe that an acquisition matches our business and investment strategies. These properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential. It is possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline after we acquire them, or that they may not perform as expected. Further, if financed by additional debt or new equity issuances, our acquisition of properties may result in stockholder dilution. Our acquisition of properties will expose us to the liabilities of those properties, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of such acquisitions. We face competition in pursuing these acquisitions and we may not succeed in leasing acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of their acquisition and operations.Newly acquired properties may require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. We may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions. Consequences arising from or in connection with any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.We are pursuing redevelopment opportunities and this creates risks to our Company.We have commenced a program to redevelop certain of our properties, and to recapture select properties from our net lease portfolio in order to redevelop such properties, for either a new convenience and gasoline use or for alternative single-tenant net lease retail uses. The success at each stage of our redevelopment program is dependent on numerous factors and risks, including our ability to identify and extract qualified sites from our portfolio and successfully prepare and market them for alternative uses, and project development issues, including those relating to planning, zoning, licensing, permitting, third party and governmental authorizations, changes in local market conditions, increases in construction costs, the availability and cost of financing, and issues arising from possible discovery of new environmental contamination and the need to conduct environmental remediation. Occupancy rates and rents at any particular redeveloped property may fail to meet our original expectations for reasons beyond our control, including changes in market and economic conditions and the development by competitors of competing properties. We could experience increased and unexpected costs or significant delays or abandonment of some or all of these redevelopment opportunities. For any of the above-described reasons, and others, we may determine to abandon opportunities that we have already begun to explore or with respect to which we have commenced redevelopment efforts and, as a result, we may fail to recover expenses already incurred. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully redevelop and lease any of our identified opportunities or that our overall redevelopment program will be successful. Consequences arising from or in connection with any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.19 Risks Related to Our Status as a REITFailure to qualify as a REIT under the federal income tax laws would have adverse consequences to our stockholders. Uncertain tax matters may have a significant impact on the results of operations for any single fiscal year or interim period or may cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT.We elected to be treated as a REIT under the federal income tax laws beginning January 1, 2001. To qualify for taxation as a REIT, we must, among other requirements such as those related to the composition of our assets and gross income, distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income, including taxable income that is accrued by us without a corresponding receipt of cash. Accordingly, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on qualifying REIT income, provided that distributions to our stockholders equal at least the amount of our taxable income as defined under the Internal Revenue Code. But, we may have to borrow money or sell assets to satisfy such distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. Many of the REIT requirements are highly technical and complex. If we were to fail to meet the requirements, we may be subject to federal income tax, excise taxes, penalties and interest or we may have to pay a deficiency dividend. We may have to borrow money or sell assets to pay such a deficiency dividend.We cannot guarantee that we will continue to qualify in the future as a REIT. We cannot give any assurance that new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the requirements relating to our qualification. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and will again be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates, we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax for taxable years beginning before 2019, we could be required to pay significant income taxes and we would have less money available for our operations and distributions to stockholders. This would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities. We could also be precluded from treatment as a REIT for four taxable years following the year in which we lost the qualification, and all distributions to stockholders would be taxable as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Loss of our REIT status could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.There is a risk of changes in the tax law applicable to real estate investment trusts.Because the IRS, the United States Treasury Department and Congress frequently review federal income tax legislation, we cannot predict whether, when or to what extent new federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be adopted. Any of such legislative actions may prospectively or retroactively modify our tax treatment and, therefore, may adversely affect taxation of us and/or our investors.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the TCJA, as amended by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. businesses and their owners, including REITs and their shareholders. Changes made by the TCJA and the CARES Act that could affect us and our shareholders include:               ● temporarily reducing individual U.S. federal income tax rates on ordinary income; the highest individual U.S. federal income tax rate has been reduced from 39.6% to 37% for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026;                                                ● permanently eliminating the progressive corporate tax rate structure, with a maximum corporate tax rate of 35%, and replacing it with a flat corporate tax rate of 21%;                                                ● permitting a deduction for certain pass-through business income, including dividends received by our shareholders from us that are not designated by us as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income, which will generally allow individuals, trusts, and estates to deduct up to 20% of such amounts for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026;                                                ● reducing the highest rate of withholding with respect to our distributions to non-U.S. stockholders that are treated as attributable to gains from the sale or exchange of U.S. real property interests from 35% to 21%;                                                ● limiting our deduction for net operating losses to 80% of REIT taxable income (prior to the application of the dividends paid deduction) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020;                                                ● generally limiting the deduction for net business interest expense in excess of a specified percentage (50% for taxable years beginning in 2019 and 2020 and 30% for subsequent taxable years) of a business’s adjusted taxable income except for taxpayers that engage in certain real estate businesses and elect out of this rule (provided that such electing taxpayers must use an alternative depreciation system for certain property); and                                                ● eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax.20 You are urged to consult with your tax advisor with respect to the status of legislative, regulatory, judicial or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our securities.U.S. federal tax reform legislation could affect REITs generally, our tenants, the markets in which we operate, the price of our common stock and our results of operations, in ways, both positively and negatively, that are difficult to predict.Certain federal tax legislation (the “2017 Legislation”) included significant changes to corporate and individual tax rates and the calculation of taxes. As a REIT, we are generally not required to pay federal taxes otherwise applicable to regular corporations if we distribute all of our income and comply with the various tax rules governing REITs. Stockholders, however, are generally required to pay taxes on REIT dividends. The 2017 Legislation changed the way in which dividends paid on our stock are taxed by the holder of that stock and could impact the price of our common stock or how stockholders and potential investors view an investment in REITs. In addition, while certain elements of the 2017 Legislation do not impact us directly as a REIT, they could impact our tenants and the markets in which we operate in ways, both positive and negative, that are difficult to predict. Prospective stockholders are urged to consult with their tax advisors with respect to the 2017 Legislation and any other regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and the potential effects thereof on an investment in our common stock.In order to preserve our REIT status, our charter limits the number of shares a person may own, which may discourage a takeover that could result in a premium price for our common stock or otherwise benefit our stockholders.Our charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our Board of Directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Unless exempted by our Board of Directors, no person may (i) own, or be deemed to own by virtue of certain constructive ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, in excess of 5.0% (in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our common stock or (ii) own, or be deemed to own by virtue of certain other constructive ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, in excess of 9.9% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding shares of our common stock, which may discourage large investors from purchasing our stock. This restriction may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all of our assets) that might provide a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders.Risks Related to Ownership of Our SecuritiesChanges in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded common stock.As with other publicly traded securities, the market price of our publicly traded common stock depends on various market conditions, which may change from time-to-time. Among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded common stock are the following: our financial condition and performance and that of our significant tenants; the market’s perception of our growth potential and potential future earnings; the reputation of REITs generally and the reputation of REITs with portfolios similar to us; the attractiveness of the securities of REITs in comparison to securities issued by other entities (including securities issued by other real estate companies); an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for publicly traded securities; the extent of institutional investor interest in us; and general economic and financial market conditions.We may change our dividend policy and the dividends we pay may be subject to significant volatility.The decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon such factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant and the dividend paid may vary from expected amounts. Any change in our dividend policy could adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock. In addition, each of the Restated Credit Agreement and senior unsecured notes prohibit the payments of dividends during certain events of default. No assurance can be given that our financial performance in the future will permit our payment of any dividends or that the amount of dividends we pay, if any, will not fluctuate significantly. Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, our ability to pay dividends would be restricted if, after payment of the dividend, (i) we would not be able to pay indebtedness as it becomes due in the usual course of business or (ii) our total assets would be less than the sum of our liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if we were to be dissolved, to satisfy the rights of any stockholders with liquidation preferences. There currently are no stockholders with liquidation preferences. No assurance can be given that our financial performance in the future will permit our payment of any dividends. Each of the Restated Credit Agreement our senior unsecured notes contain customary financial covenants such as availability, leverage and coverage ratios and minimum tangible net worth, as well as limitations on restricted payments, which may limit our ability to incur additional debt or pay dividends. As a result of the factors described above, we may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis, which could materially and adversely affect our business, stock price and ability to pay dividends.21 Future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our equity securities.Our future growth depends upon our ability to raise additional capital. If we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities, such issuance, the receipt of the net proceeds thereof and the use of such proceeds may have a dilutive effect on our expected earnings per share, funds from operations per share and adjusted funds from operations per share. The actual amount of such dilution cannot be determined at this time and will be based on numerous factors. Additionally, we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or preferred stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities in the future. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market after an offering or the perception that such sales could occur.Maryland law may discourage a third-party from acquiring us.We are subject to the provisions of the Maryland Business Combination Act (the “Business Combination Act”) which prohibits transactions between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Generally, pursuant to the Business Combination Act, an “interested stockholder” is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of a Maryland corporation’s voting stock. These provisions could have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of our Company or reducing the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our capital stock. Additionally, the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act may deny voting rights to shares involved in an acquisition of one-tenth or more of the voting stock of a Maryland corporation. In our charter and bylaws, we have elected not to have the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act apply to any acquisition by any person of shares of stock of our Company. However, in the case of the control share acquisition statute, our Board of Directors may opt to make this statute applicable to us at any time by amending our bylaws, and may do so on a retroactive basis. Finally, the “unsolicited takeovers” provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law permit our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to implement certain provisions that may have the effect of inhibiting a third-party from making an acquisition proposal for our Company or of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our Company under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price or that stockholders may otherwise believe is in their best interests.             "
11,GTY,GETTY REALTY CORP,2020-02-27,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
We are subject to various risks, many of which are beyond our control. As a result of these and other factors, we may experience material fluctuations in our future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. An investment in our stock involves various risks, including those mentioned below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and those that are described from time to time in our other filings with the SEC.We incur significant operating costs and, from time to time, may have significant liability accruals as a result of environmental laws and regulations, which costs and accruals could significantly increase, and reduce our profitability or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, including matters relating to the protection of the environment. Under certain environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at, on, or under, such property, and may be required to investigate and clean-up such contamination. Such laws typically impose liability and clean-up responsibility first on the party responsible for the contamination, but can also impose liability and clean-up responsibility on the owner and the current operator without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants, or the timing or cause of the contamination. Liability under such environmental laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility and the financial resources are available to perform the remediation. For example, liability may arise as a result of the historical use of a property or from the migration of contamination from adjacent or nearby properties. Any such contamination or liability may also reduce the value of the property. In addition, the owner or operator of a property may be subject to claims by third-parties based on injury, damage and/or costs, including investigation and clean-up costs, resulting from environmental contamination present at or emanating from a property. We cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations may be enacted in the future, or how existing laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted with respect to products or activities to which they have not previously been applied. Additionally, compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of the regulatory agencies or stricter interpretation of existing laws, which may develop in the future, could have an adverse effect on our financial position, or that of our tenants, and could require substantial additional expenditures for future remediation. Accordingly, compliance with environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.The properties owned or controlled by us are leased primarily as convenience store and gasoline station properties, and therefore may contain, or may have contained, USTs for the storage of petroleum products and other hazardous or toxic substances, which creates a potential for the release of such products or substances. Some of our properties are subject to regulations regarding the 8 retirement and decommissioning or removal of long-lived assets including buildings containing hazardous materials, USTs and other equipment. Some of the properties may be adjacent to or near properties that have contained or currently contain USTs used to store petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, certain of the properties are on, adjacent to, or near properties upon which others have engaged or may in the future engage in activities that may release petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. There may be other environmental problems associated with our properties of which we are unaware. These problems may make it more difficult for us to re-lease or sell our properties on favorable terms, or at all.We enter into leases and various other agreements which contractually allocate responsibility between the parties for known and unknown environmental liabilities at or relating to the subject properties. We are contingently liable for these environmental obligations in the event that our tenant does not satisfy them, and we are required to accrue for environmental liabilities that we believe are allocable to others under our leases if we determine that it is probable that our tenant will not meet its environmental obligations. It is possible that our assumptions regarding the ultimate allocation method and share of responsibility that we used to allocate environmental liabilities may change, which may result in material adjustments to the amounts recorded for environmental litigation accruals and environmental remediation liabilities. We assess whether to accrue for environmental liabilities based upon relevant factors including our tenants’ histories of paying for such obligations, our assessment of their financial capability, and their intent to pay for such obligations. However, there can be no assurance that our assessments are correct or that our tenants who have paid their obligations in the past will continue to do so. We may ultimately be responsible to pay for environmental liabilities as the property owner if our tenant fails to pay them. The ultimate resolution of these matters could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.For substantially all of our triple-net leases, our tenants are contractually responsible for compliance with environmental laws and regulations, removal of USTs at the end of their lease term (the cost of which in certain cases is partially borne by us) and remediation of any environmental contamination that arises during the term of their tenancy. Under the terms of our leases covering properties previously leased to Marketing (substantially all of which commenced in 2012), we have agreed to be responsible for environmental contamination at the premises that was known at the time the lease commenced, and for environmental contamination which existed prior to commencement of the lease and is discovered (other than as a result of a voluntary site investigation) during the first 10 years of the lease term (or a shorter period for a minority of such leases). After expiration of such 10-year (or, in certain cases, shorter) period, responsibility for all newly discovered contamination, even if it relates to periods prior to commencement of the lease, is contractually allocated to our tenant. Our tenants at properties previously leased to Marketing are in all cases responsible for the cost of any remediation of contamination that results from their use and occupancy of our properties. Under substantially all of our other triple-net leases, responsibility for remediation of all environmental contamination discovered during the term of the lease (including known and unknown contamination that existed prior to commencement of the lease) is the responsibility of our tenant.We anticipate that a majority of the USTs at properties previously leased to Marketing will be replaced over the next several years because these USTs are either at or near the end of their useful lives. For long-term, triple-net leases covering sites previously leased to Marketing, our tenants are responsible for the cost of removal and replacement of USTs and for remediation of contamination found during such UST removal and replacement, unless such contamination was found during the first 10 years of the lease term and also existed prior to commencement of the lease. In those cases, we are responsible for costs associated with the remediation of such preexisting contamination. We have also agreed to be responsible for environmental contamination that existed prior to the sale of certain properties assuming the contamination is discovered (other than as a result of a voluntary site investigation) during the first five years after the sale of the properties.In the course of certain UST removals and replacements at properties previously leased to Marketing where we retained continuing responsibility for preexisting environmental obligations, previously unknown environmental contamination was and continues to be discovered. As a result, we have developed an estimate of fair value for the prospective future environmental liability resulting from preexisting unknown environmental contamination and have accrued for these estimated costs. These estimates are based primarily upon quantifiable trends which we believe allow us to make reasonable estimates of fair value for the future costs of environmental remediation resulting from the removal and replacement of USTs. Our accrual of the additional liability represents our estimate of the fair value of cost for each component of the liability, net of estimated recoveries from state UST remediation funds considering estimated recovery rates developed from prior experience with the funds. In arriving at our accrual, we analyzed the ages of USTs at properties where we would be responsible for preexisting contamination found within 10 years after commencement of a lease (for properties subject to long-term triple-net leases) or five years from a sale (for divested properties), and projected a cost to closure for preexisting unknown environmental contamination.We measure our environmental remediation liabilities at fair value based on expected future net cash flows, adjusted for inflation, and then discount them to present value. We adjust our environmental remediation liabilities quarterly to reflect changes in projected expenditures, changes in present value due to the passage of time and reductions in estimated liabilities as a result of actual expenditures incurred during each quarter. As of December 31, 2019, we had accrued a total of $50.7 million for our prospective environmental remediation obligations. This accrual consisted of (a) $12.4 million, which was our estimate of reasonably estimable environmental remediation liability, including obligations to remove USTs for which we are responsible, net of estimated recoveries and (b) $38.3 million for future environmental liabilities related to preexisting unknown contamination.9 For additional information regarding pending environmental lawsuits and claims, and environmental remediation obligations and estimates, see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings”, “Environmental Matters” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Notes 3 and 5 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K.Environmental exposures are difficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons, including the amount of data available upon initial assessment of contamination, alternative treatment methods that may be applied, location of the property which subjects it to differing local laws and regulations and their interpretations, changes in costs associated with environmental remediation services and equipment, the availability of state UST remediation funds and the possibility of existing legal claims giving rise to allocation of responsibilities to others, as well as the time it takes to remediate contamination and receive regulatory approval. In developing our liability for estimated environmental remediation obligations on a property by property basis, we consider, among other things, laws and regulations, assessments of contamination and surrounding geology, quality of information available, currently available technologies for treatment, alternative methods of remediation and prior experience. Environmental accruals are based on estimates derived upon facts known to us at this time, which are subject to significant change as circumstances change, and as environmental contingencies become more clearly defined and reasonably estimable.We cannot predict if state UST fund programs will be administered and funded in the future in a manner that is consistent with past practices and if future environmental spending will continue to be eligible for reimbursement at historical recovery rates under these programs. As a result, our estimates in respect of recoveries from state UST remediation funds could change, which could adversely affect our accruals for environmental remediation liabilities.Any changes to our estimates or our assumptions that form the basis of our estimates may result in our providing an accrual, or adjustments to the amounts recorded, for environmental remediation liabilities. Additional environmental liabilities could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.Substantially all of our tenants depend on the same industry for their revenues.We derive substantially all of our revenues from leasing, primarily on a triple-net basis, and financing convenience store and gasoline station properties to tenants in the petroleum marketing industry. Accordingly, our revenues are substantially dependent on the economic success of the petroleum marketing industry, and any factors that adversely affect that industry, such as disruption in the supply of petroleum or a decrease in the demand for conventional motor fuels due to conservation, technological advancements in petroleum-fueled motor vehicles or an increase in the use of alternative fuel and battery-operated vehicles, or other “green technologies,” could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. The success of participants in the petroleum marketing industry depends upon the sale of refined petroleum products at margins in excess of fixed and variable expenses. The petroleum marketing industry is highly competitive and volatile. Petroleum products are commodities, the prices of which depend on numerous factors that affect supply and demand. The prices paid by our tenants and other petroleum marketers for products are affected by global, national and regional factors. A large, rapid increase in wholesale petroleum prices would adversely affect the profitability and cash flows of our tenants if the increased cost of petroleum products could not be passed on to their customers or if automobile consumption of gasoline was to decline significantly. We cannot be certain as to how these factors will affect petroleum product prices or supply in the future, or how in particular they will affect our tenants.Because certain of our tenants are not rated and their financial information is not available to you, it may be difficult for our investors to determine their creditworthiness.The majority of our properties are leased to tenants who are not rated by any nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. In addition, our tenants’ financial information is not generally available to our investors. Additionally, many of our tenants are part of larger corporate organizations and we do not receive financial information for the other entities in those organizations. The financial distress of other affiliated companies or businesses in those organizations may negatively impact the ability or willingness of our tenant to perform its obligations under its lease with us. Because of the lack of financial information or credit ratings it is, therefore, difficult for our investors to assess the creditworthiness of our tenants and to determine the ability of our tenants to meet their obligations to us. It is possible that the assumptions and estimates we make after reviewing publicly and privately obtained information about our tenants are not accurate and that we may be required to increase reserves for bad debts, record allowances for deferred rent receivable or record additional expenses if our tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations to us.Our future cash flow is dependent on the performance of our tenants of their lease obligations, renewal of existing leases and either re-leasing or selling our properties.We are subject to risks that financial distress, default or bankruptcy of our tenants may lead to vacancy at our properties or disruption in rent receipts as a result of partial payment or nonpayment of rent or that expiring leases may not be renewed. Under unfavorable general economic conditions, there can be no assurance that our tenants’ level of sales and financial performance 10 generally will not be adversely affected, which in turn could negatively impact our rental revenues. We are subject to risks that the terms governing renewal or re-leasing of our properties (including, compliance with numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment, such as the remediation of contamination and the retirement and decommissioning or removal of long-lived assets, the cost of required renovations, or replacement of USTs and related equipment) may be less favorable than current lease terms.We are also subject to the risk that we may receive less net proceeds from the properties we sell as compared to their current carrying value or that the value of our properties may be adversely affected by unfavorable general economic conditions. Unfavorable general economic conditions may also negatively impact our ability to re-lease or sell our properties. Numerous properties compete with our properties in attracting tenants to lease space. The number of available or competitive properties in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease or sell our properties and on the rents we are able to charge. In addition to the risk of disruption in rent receipts, we are subject to the risk of incurring real estate taxes, maintenance, environmental and other expenses at vacant properties. The financial distress, default or bankruptcy of our tenants may also lead to protracted and expensive processes for retaking control of our properties than would otherwise be the case, including, eviction or other legal proceedings related to or resulting from the tenant’s default. These risks are greater with respect to certain of our tenants who lease multiple properties from us. If a tenant files for bankruptcy protection it is possible that we would recover substantially less than the full value of our claims against the tenant. If (i) our tenants do not perform their lease obligations, (ii) we are unable to renew existing leases and promptly recapture and re-lease or sell our properties, (iii) lease terms upon renewal or re-leasing are less favorable than current or historical lease terms, (iv) the values of properties that we sell are adversely affected by market conditions, or (v) we incur significant costs or disruption related to or resulting from tenant financial distress, default or bankruptcy, then our cash flow could be significantly adversely affected.We are dependent on external sources of capital which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.We are dependent on external sources of capital to maintain our status as a REIT and must distribute to our stockholders each year at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding any net capital gain. Because of these distribution requirements, it is not likely that we will be able to fund all future capital needs, including acquisitions, from income from operations. Therefore, we will have to continue to rely on third-party sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. We may need to access the capital markets in order to execute future significant acquisitions. There can be no assurance that sources of capital will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.Our principal sources of liquidity are the cash flows from our operations, funds available under our $300.0 million senior unsecured credit agreement (as amended, the “Restated Credit Agreement”), with a group of commercial banks led by Bank of America, N.A., proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock through offerings, from time to time, under our at-the-market program (“ATM Program”) and available cash and cash equivalents. The Restated Credit Agreement consists of a $300.0 million unsecured revolving facility (the “Revolving Facility”), which is scheduled to mature in March 2022. Subject to the terms of the Restated Credit Agreement and our continued compliance with its provisions, we have the option to (a) extend the term of the Revolving Facility for one additional year to March 2023 and (b) request that the lenders approve an increase of up to $300.0 million in the amount of the Revolving Facility to $600.0 million in the aggregate. We have also issued $450.0 million of senior unsecured notes. For additional information, see “Credit Agreement” and “Senior Unsecured Notes” in Note 4 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K.The Restated Credit Agreement and our senior unsecured notes contain customary financial covenants such as leverage, coverage ratios and minimum tangible net worth, as well as limitations on restricted payments, which may limit our ability to incur additional debt or pay dividends. The Restated Credit Agreement and our senior unsecured notes also contain customary events of default, including cross defaults to each other, change of control and failure to maintain REIT status (provided that the senior unsecured notes require a mandatory offer to prepay the notes upon a change in control in lieu of a change of control event of default). Our ability to meet the terms of the agreements is dependent upon our continued ability to meet certain criteria, as further described in Note 4 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K, the performance of our tenants and the other risks described in this section. If we are not in compliance with one or more of our covenants, which could result in an event of default under our Restated Credit Agreement or our senior unsecured notes, there can be no assurance that our lenders would waive such non-compliance. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.Under our ATM Program, we may issue and sell shares of our common stock with an aggregate sales price of up to $125.0 million through a consortium of banks acting as agents. Sales of shares of our common stock under our ATM Program may be made from time to time in at-the-market offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, including by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or as otherwise agreed to with the applicable agent. Sales of shares of our common stock under our ATM Program, if any, will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including among others, market conditions and the trading price of our common stock. Our agents are not required to sell any specific number or dollar amount of our 11 common stock, but each agent will use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices and applicable law and regulation to sell shares designated by us in accordance with the terms of the distribution agreement with our agents. The net proceeds we receive will be the gross proceeds received from such sales less the commissions and any other costs we may incur in issuing the shares of our common stock.We may use a portion of the net proceeds from any of such sales to reduce our outstanding indebtedness, including borrowings under our Revolving Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility includes lenders who are affiliates of our agents. As a result, a portion of the net proceeds from any sale of shares of our common stock under our ATM Program that is used to repay amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility will be received by these affiliates. Because an affiliate may receive a portion of the net proceeds from any of these sales, each of our agents may have an interest in these sales beyond the sales commission it will receive. This could result in a conflict of interest and cause such agents to act in a manner that is not in the best interests of us or our investors in connection with any sale of shares of our common stock under our ATM Program.Our access to third-party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors including general market conditions, the market’s perception of our growth potential, financial stability, our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions, covenants and limitations imposed under our Restated Credit Agreement and our senior unsecured notes, and the market price of our common stock.We are exposed to counterparty risk and there can be no assurances that we will effectively manage or mitigate this risk.We regularly interact with counterparties in various industries. The types of counterparties most common to our transactions and agreements include, but are not limited to, landlords, tenants, vendors and lenders. We also enter into agreements to acquire and sell properties which allocate responsibility for certain costs to the counterparty. Our most significant counterparties include, but are not limited to, the members of the bank syndicate related to our Restated Credit Agreement, the lenders that are the counterparties to our senior unsecured notes and our major tenants from whom we derive a significant amount of rental revenue. The default, insolvency or other inability or unwillingness of a significant counterparty to perform its obligations under an agreement, including, without limitation, as a result of the rejection of an agreement in bankruptcy proceedings, is likely to have a material adverse effect on us. As of December 31, 2019, we leased 153 convenience store and gasoline station properties in three separate unitary leases and three stand-alone leases to subsidiaries of Global. In the aggregate, our leases with subsidiaries of Global represented 18% and 17% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. All of our unitary leases with subsidiaries of Global are guaranteed by the parent company. As of December 31, 2019, we leased 77 convenience store and gasoline station properties in three separate unitary leases to United Oil. In the aggregate, our leases with United Oil represented 13% of our total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. As of December 31, 2019, we leased 75 convenience store and gasoline station properties in two separate unitary leases to subsidiaries of Chestnut. In the aggregate, our leases with subsidiaries of Chestnut represented 11% of our total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The largest of these unitary leases, covering 57 of our properties, is guaranteed by the parent company, its principals and numerous Chestnut affiliates.We may also undertake additional transactions with these or other existing tenants, which would further concentrate our sources of rental revenues. Many of our tenants, including those noted above, are part of larger corporate organizations and the financial distress of one subsidiary or other affiliated companies or businesses in those organizations may negatively impact the ability or willingness of our tenant to perform its obligations under its lease with us. The failure of a major tenant or their default in their rental and other obligations to us is likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial position and results of operations, and they require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain.Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial position and results of operations. We have identified several accounting policies as being critical to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations because they require management to make particularly subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be recorded under different conditions or using different assumptions. We cannot provide any assurance that we will not make subsequent significant adjustments to our consolidated financial statements. Estimates, judgments and assumptions underlying our consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, receivables and related reserves, deferred rent receivable, income under direct financing leases, asset retirement obligations (including environmental remediation obligations and future environmental liabilities for pre-existing unknown environmental contamination), real estate, depreciation and amortization, carrying value of our properties, impairment of long-lived assets, litigation, accrued liabilities, income taxes and allocation of the purchase price of properties acquired to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If our accounting policies, methods, judgments, assumptions, estimates and allocations prove to be incorrect, or if circumstances change, our business, financial condition, revenues, operating expense, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price may be materially adversely affected.12 We may not be able to successfully implement our investment strategy.We may not be able to successfully implement our investment strategy. We cannot assure you that our portfolio of properties will expand at all, or if it will expand at any specified rate or to any specified size. As part of our overall growth strategy, we regularly review acquisition, financing and redevelopment opportunities, and we expect to continue to pursue investments that we believe will benefit our financial performance. We cannot assure you that investment opportunities which meet our investment criteria will be available. Pursuing our investment opportunities may result in additional debt or new equity issuances, that may initially be dilutive to our net income, and such investments may not perform as we expect or produce the returns that we anticipate (including, without limitation, as a result of tenant bankruptcies, tenant concessions, our inability to collect rents and higher than anticipated operating expenses). Further, we may not be able to successfully integrate investments into our existing portfolio without operating disruptions or unanticipated costs. To the extent that our current sources of liquidity are not sufficient to fund such investments, we will require other sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Additionally, to the extent that we increase the size of our portfolio, we may not be able to adapt our management, administrative, accounting and operational systems, or hire and retain sufficient operational staff to integrate investments into our portfolio or manage any future investments without operating disruptions or unanticipated costs. Moreover, our continued growth will require increased investment in management personnel, professional fees, other personnel, financial and management systems and controls and facilities, which will result in additional operating expenses. Under the circumstances described above, our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects may be materially adversely affected.We expect to acquire new properties and this may create risks.We may acquire properties when we believe that an acquisition matches our business and investment strategies. These properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential. It is possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline after we acquire them, or that they may not perform as expected. Further, if financed by additional debt or new equity issuances, our acquisition of properties may result in stockholder dilution. Our acquisition of properties will expose us to the liabilities of those properties, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of such acquisitions. We face competition in pursuing these acquisitions and we may not succeed in leasing acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of their acquisition and operations.Newly acquired properties may require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. We may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions. Consequences arising from or in connection with any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.We are pursuing redevelopment opportunities and this creates risks to our Company.We have commenced a program to redevelop certain of our properties, and to recapture select properties from our net lease portfolio in order to redevelop such properties, for either a new convenience and gasoline use or for alternative single-tenant net lease retail uses. The success at each stage of our redevelopment program is dependent on numerous factors and risks, including our ability to identify and extract qualified sites from our portfolio and successfully prepare and market them for alternative uses, and project development issues, including those relating to planning, zoning, licensing, permitting, third party and governmental authorizations, changes in local market conditions, increases in construction costs, the availability and cost of financing, and issues arising from possible discovery of new environmental contamination and the need to conduct environmental remediation. Occupancy rates and rents at any particular redeveloped property may fail to meet our original expectations for reasons beyond our control, including changes in market and economic conditions and the development by competitors of competing properties. We could experience increased and unexpected costs or significant delays or abandonment of some or all of these redevelopment opportunities. For any of the above-described reasons, and others, we may determine to abandon opportunities that we have already begun to explore or with respect to which we have commenced redevelopment efforts and, as a result, we may fail to recover expenses already incurred. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully redevelop and lease any of our identified opportunities or that our overall redevelopment program will be successful. Consequences arising from or in connection with any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.We are exposed to interest rate risk and there can be no assurances that we will manage or mitigate this risk effectively.We are exposed to interest rate risk, primarily as a result of our Restated Credit Agreement. Borrowings under our Restated Credit Agreement bear interest at a floating rate. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates will increase the amount of interest we must pay under our Restated Credit Agreement. Our interest rate risk may materially change in the future if we increase our borrowings under the Restated Credit Agreement or amend our Restated Credit Agreement or our senior unsecured notes, seek other sources of debt or equity capital or refinance our outstanding indebtedness. A significant increase in interest rates could also make it more difficult to find alternative financing on desirable terms. For additional information with respect to interest rate risk, see “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in this Form 10-K.13 We are subject to risks inherent in owning and leasing real estate.We are subject to varying degrees of risk generally related to leasing and owning real estate, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to general risks applicable to us, our risks include, among others: our liability as a lessee for long-term lease obligations regardless of our revenues; deterioration in national, regional and local economic and real estate market conditions; potential changes in supply of, or demand for, rental properties similar to ours; competition for tenants and declining rental rates; difficulty in selling or re-leasing properties on favorable terms or at all; impairments in our ability to collect rent or other payments due to us when they are due; increases in interest rates and adverse changes in the availability, cost and terms of financing; uninsured property liability; the impact of present or future environmental legislation and compliance with environmental laws; adverse changes in zoning laws and other regulations; acts of terrorism and war; acts of God; the unforeseen impacts of climate change, compliance with any future laws or regulations designed to prevent or mitigate the impacts of climate change, and any material costs related thereto; the potential risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time the need to periodically renovate and repair our properties; and physical or weather-related damage to our properties. Certain significant expenditures generally do not change in response to economic or other conditions, including: (i) debt service, (ii) real estate taxes, (iii) environmental remediation costs and (iv) operating and maintenance costs. The combination of variable revenue and relatively fixed expenditures may result, under certain market conditions, in reduced earnings and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.Each of the factors listed above could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. In addition, real estate investments are relatively illiquid, which means that our ability to vary our portfolio of properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be limited.Our business operations may not generate sufficient cash for distributions or debt service.There is no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay dividends on our common stock, to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may not be able to repay or refinance existing indebtedness on favorable terms, which could force us to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms (which may also result in losses) or accept financing on unfavorable terms.Adverse developments in general business, economic or political conditions could have a material adverse effect on us.Adverse developments in general business and economic conditions, including through recession, downturn or otherwise, either in the economy generally or in those regions in which a large portion of our business is conducted, could have a material adverse effect on us and significantly increase certain of the risks we are subject to. Among other effects, adverse economic conditions could depress real estate values, impact our ability to re-lease or sell our properties and have an adverse effect on our tenants’ level of sales and financial performance generally. As our revenues are substantially dependent on the economic success of our tenants, any factors that adversely impact our tenants could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.Inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Although inflation has not materially impacted our results of operations in the recent past, increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations. During times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, as provided for in our leases, rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation. Likewise, even though our triple-net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation, substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue, which may adversely affect our tenants’ ability to pay rent.Recently enacted U.S. federal tax reform legislation could affect REITs generally, our tenants, the markets in which we operate, the price of our common stock and our results of operations, in ways, both positively and negatively, that are difficult to predict.Recent federal tax legislation (the “2017 Legislation”) included significant changes to corporate and individual tax rates and the calculation of taxes. As a REIT, we are generally not required to pay federal taxes otherwise applicable to regular corporations if we distribute all of our income and comply with the various tax rules governing REITs. Stockholders, however, are generally required to pay taxes on REIT dividends. The 2017 Legislation changed the way in which dividends paid on our stock are taxed by the holder of that stock and could impact the price of our common stock or how stockholders and potential investors view an investment in REITs. In addition, while certain elements of the 2017 Legislation do not impact us directly as a REIT, they could impact our tenants and the markets in which we operate in ways, both positive and negative, that are difficult to predict. Prospective stockholders are urged to consult with their tax advisors with respect to the 2017 Legislation and any other regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and the potential effects thereof on an investment in our common stock.14 Property taxes on our properties may increase without notice.Each of the properties we own or lease is subject to real property taxes. The leases for certain of the properties that we lease from third-parties obligate us to pay real property taxes with regard to those properties. The real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we acquire or lease in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities. To the extent that our tenants are unable or unwilling to pay such increase in accordance with their leases, our net operating expenses may increase.We are defending pending lawsuits and claims and are subject to material losses.We are subject to various lawsuits and claims, including litigation related to environmental matters, such as those arising from leaking USTs, contamination of groundwater with methyl tertiary butyl ether (a fuel derived from methanol, commonly referred to as “MTBE”) and releases of motor fuel into the environment, and toxic tort claims. The ultimate resolution of certain matters cannot be predicted because considerable uncertainty exists both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimate of such loss. Our ultimate liabilities resulting from the lawsuits and claims we face could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. For additional information with respect to certain pending lawsuits and claims, see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” and Note 3 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K.A significant portion of our properties are concentrated in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, and adverse conditions in those regions, in particular, could negatively impact our operations.A significant portion of the properties we own and lease are located in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States and, as of December 31, 2019, 45.9% of our properties are concentrated in three states (New York, Massachusetts and Connecticut). Because of the concentration of our properties in those regions, in the event of adverse economic conditions in those regions, we would likely experience higher risk of default on payment of rent to us than if our properties were more geographically diversified. Additionally, the rents on our properties may be subject to a greater risk of default than other properties in the event of adverse economic, political or business developments, natural disasters or severe weather that may affect the Northeast or Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States and the ability of our lessees to make rent payments. This lack of geographical diversification could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.We are in a competitive business.The real estate industry is highly competitive. Where we own properties, we compete for tenants with a large number of real estate property owners and other companies that sublet properties. Our principal means of competition are rents we are able to charge in relation to the income producing potential of the location. In addition, we expect other major real estate investors, some with much greater financial resources or more experienced personnel than we have, will compete with us for attractive acquisition opportunities. These competitors include petroleum manufacturing, distributing and marketing companies, convenience store retailers, other REITs, public and private investment funds, and other individual and institutional investors. This competition has increased prices for properties we seek to acquire and may impair our ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms in the future.We are subject to losses that may not be covered by insurance.We and our tenants carry insurance against certain risks and in such amounts as we believe are customary for businesses of our kind. However, as the costs and availability of insurance change, we may decide not to be covered against certain losses (such as certain environmental liabilities, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and civil disorder) where, in the judgment of management, the insurance is not warranted due to cost or availability of coverage or the remoteness of perceived risk. Furthermore, there are certain types of losses, such as losses resulting from wars, terrorism or certain acts of God, that generally are not insured because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. There is no assurance that the existing insurance coverages are or will be sufficient to cover actual losses incurred. The destruction of, or significant damage to, or significant liabilities arising out of conditions at, our properties due to an uninsured loss would result in an economic loss and could result in us losing both our investment in, and anticipated profits from, such properties. When a loss is insured, the coverage may be insufficient in amount or duration, or a lessee’s customers may be lost, such that the lessee cannot resume its business after the loss at prior levels or at all, resulting in reduced rent or a default under its lease. Any such loss relating to a large number of properties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.15 Failure to qualify as a REIT under the federal income tax laws would have adverse consequences to our stockholders. Uncertain tax matters may have a significant impact on the results of operations for any single fiscal year or interim period or may cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT.We elected to be treated as a REIT under the federal income tax laws beginning January 1, 2001. To qualify for taxation as a REIT, we must, among other requirements such as those related to the composition of our assets and gross income, distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income, including taxable income that is accrued by us without a corresponding receipt of cash. Accordingly, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on qualifying REIT income, provided that distributions to our stockholders equal at least the amount of our taxable income as defined under the Internal Revenue Code. But, we may have to borrow money or sell assets to satisfy such distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. Many of the REIT requirements are highly technical and complex. If we were to fail to meet the requirements, we may be subject to federal income tax, excise taxes, penalties and interest or we may have to pay a deficiency dividend. We may have to borrow money or sell assets to pay such a deficiency dividend.We cannot guarantee that we will continue to qualify in the future as a REIT. We cannot give any assurance that new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the requirements relating to our qualification. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and will again be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates, we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax for taxable years beginning before 2019, we could be required to pay significant income taxes and we would have less money available for our operations and distributions to stockholders. This would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities. We could also be precluded from treatment as a REIT for four taxable years following the year in which we lost the qualification, and all distributions to stockholders would be taxable as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Loss of our REIT status could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.Future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our equity securities.Our future growth depends upon our ability to raise additional capital. If we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities, such issuance, the receipt of the net proceeds thereof and the use of such proceeds may have a dilutive effect on our expected earnings per share, funds from operations per share and adjusted funds from operations per share. The actual amount of such dilution cannot be determined at this time and will be based on numerous factors. Additionally, we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or preferred stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities in the future. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market after an offering or the perception that such sales could occur.We may change our dividend policy and the dividends we pay may be subject to significant volatility.The decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon such factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant and the dividend paid may vary from expected amounts. Any change in our dividend policy could adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock. In addition, each of the Restated Credit Agreement and senior unsecured notes prohibit the payments of dividends during certain events of default. No assurance can be given that our financial performance in the future will permit our payment of any dividends or that the amount of dividends we pay, if any, will not fluctuate significantly. Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, our ability to pay dividends would be restricted if, after payment of the dividend, (i) we would not be able to pay indebtedness as it becomes due in the usual course of business or (ii) our total assets would be less than the sum of our liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if we were to be dissolved, to satisfy the rights of any stockholders with liquidation preferences. There currently are no stockholders with liquidation preferences. No assurance can be given that our financial performance in the future will permit our payment of any dividends. Each of the Restated Credit Agreement our senior unsecured notes contain customary financial covenants such as availability, leverage and coverage ratios and minimum tangible net worth, as well as limitations on restricted payments, which may limit our ability to incur additional debt or pay dividends. As a result of the factors described above, we may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis, which could materially and adversely affect our business, stock price and ability to pay dividends.Changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded common stock.As with other publicly traded securities, the market price of our publicly traded common stock depends on various market conditions, which may change from time-to-time. Among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded common stock are the following: our financial condition and performance and that of our significant tenants; the market’s perception of our growth potential and potential future earnings; the reputation of REITs generally and the reputation of REITs with portfolios 16 similar to us; the attractiveness of the securities of REITs in comparison to securities issued by other entities (including securities issued by other real estate companies); an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for publicly traded securities; the extent of institutional investor interest in us; and general economic and financial market conditions.In order to preserve our REIT status, our charter limits the number of shares a person may own, which may discourage a takeover that could result in a premium price for our common stock or otherwise benefit our stockholders.Our charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our Board of Directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Unless exempted by our Board of Directors, no person may (i) own, or be deemed to own by virtue of certain constructive ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, in excess of 5.0% (in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our common stock or (ii) own, or be deemed to own by virtue of certain other constructive ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, in excess of 9.9% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding shares of our common stock, which may discourage large investors from purchasing our stock. This restriction may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all of our assets) that might provide a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders.Maryland law may discourage a third-party from acquiring us.We are subject to the provisions of the Maryland Business Combination Act (the “Business Combination Act”) which prohibits transactions between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Generally, pursuant to the Business Combination Act, an “interested stockholder” is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of a Maryland corporation’s voting stock. These provisions could have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of our Company or reducing the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our capital stock. Additionally, the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act may deny voting rights to shares involved in an acquisition of one-tenth or more of the voting stock of a Maryland corporation. In our charter and bylaws, we have elected not to have the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act apply to any acquisition by any person of shares of stock of our Company. However, in the case of the control share acquisition statute, our Board of Directors may opt to make this statute applicable to us at any time by amending our bylaws, and may do so on a retroactive basis. Finally, the “unsolicited takeovers” provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law permit our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to implement certain provisions that may have the effect of inhibiting a third-party from making an acquisition proposal for our Company or of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our Company under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price or that stockholders may otherwise believe is in their best interests.We may be adversely affected by changes in LIBOR reporting practices or the method in which LIBOR is calculated.On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly-created index, calculated by reference to short-term repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasury securities, called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). The first publication of SOFR was released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in April 2018. Whether SOFR will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of LIBOR, however, remains in question. As such, the future of LIBOR and potential alternatives thereto are uncertain at this time. If LIBOR is discontinued, pursuant to the Second Amendment to the Restated Credit Agreement, our interest rate for our borrowings under the Restated Credit Agreement will be based on SOFR or an alternative rate otherwise agreed upon. Such an event would not affect our ability to borrow or maintain already outstanding borrowings, but the alternative rate could be higher and more volatile than LIBOR prior to its discontinuance. Accordingly, the potential effects of the foregoing on our cost of capital cannot yet be determined.The loss of certain members of our management team or Board of Directors could adversely affect our business or the market price of our common stock.Our future success and ability to implement our business and investment strategy depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key management personnel and directors, and on the continued contributions of such persons, each of whom may be difficult to replace. As a REIT, we employ only 31 employees and have a cost-effective management structure. We do not have any employment agreements with any of our executives. In the event of the loss of key management personnel or directors, or upon unexpected death, disability or retirement, we may not be able to find replacements with comparable skill, ability and industry expertise, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock 17 price. Additionally, certain of our directors beneficially own more than 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If any of these directors cease to be a director of the Company and they or their estate sell a significant portion of such holdings into the public market, it could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.Amendments to the Accounting Standards Codification made by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) or changes in accounting standards issued by other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability or financial position.Our consolidated financial statements are subject to the application of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification, which is periodically amended by the FASB. The application of GAAP is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, we are required to adopt amendments to the Accounting Standards Codification or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time-to-time by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB and the SEC. Those changes could adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability or financial position.Our assets may be subject to impairment charges.We periodically evaluate our real estate investments and other assets for impairment indicators. The judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on GAAP, and includes a variety of factors such as market conditions, the accumulation of asset retirement costs due to changes in estimates associated with our estimated environmental liabilities, the status of significant leases, the financial condition of major tenants and other assumptions and factors that could affect the cash flow from or fair value of our properties. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we incurred $4.0 million and $6.2 million, respectively, of impairment charges. We may be required to take similar impairment charges, which could affect the implementation of our current business strategy and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the market on which our common stock trades, the markets in which we operate, our operations and our results of operations.Terrorist attacks or other acts of violence or war could affect our business or the businesses of our tenants. The consequences of armed conflicts are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. More generally, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States and worldwide financial markets and economy. Terrorist attacks also could be a factor resulting in, or which could exacerbate, an economic recession in the United States or abroad. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.We rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business.We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, including financial transactions and maintenance of records, which may include personal identifying information of tenants and lease data. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting and storing confidential tenant information, such as individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts. Although we have taken steps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems, it is possible that our security measures will not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning, or the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyberattacks. Security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect us.If we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately and timely report our financial results.Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, effectively prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. We are required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.As a result of material weaknesses or significant deficiencies that may be identified in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may also identify certain deficiencies in some of our disclosure controls and procedures that we believe require remediation. If we or our independent registered public accounting firm discover any such weaknesses or deficiencies, we will make efforts to further improve our internal control over financial reporting controls. However, there is no assurance that we will be 18 successful. Any failure to maintain effective controls or timely effect any necessary improvement of our internal control over financial reporting controls could harm operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, which could affect the listing of our common stock on the NYSE. Ineffective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the per share trading price of our common stock"
7,GTY,GETTY REALTY CORP,2019-02-27,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
We are subject to various risks, many of which are beyond our control. As a result of these and other factors, we may experience material fluctuations in our future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. An investment in our stock involves various risks, including those mentioned below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and those that are described from time to time in our other filings with the SEC.We incur significant operating costs as a result of environmental laws and regulations which costs could significantly rise and reduce our profitability.We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, including matters relating to the protection of the environment. Under certain environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at, on, or under, such property, and may be required to investigate and clean-up such contamination. Such laws typically impose liability and clean-up responsibility first on the party responsible for the contamination, but can also impose liability and clean-up responsibility on the owner and the current operator without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants, or the timing or cause of the contamination. Liability under such environmental laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility and the financial resources are available to perform the remediation. For example, liability may arise as a result of the historical use of a property or from the migration of contamination from adjacent or nearby properties. Any such contamination or liability may also reduce the value of the property. In addition, the owner or operator of a property may be subject to claims by third-parties based on injury, damage and/or costs, including investigation and clean-up costs, resulting from environmental contamination present at or emanating from a property. The properties owned or controlled by us are leased primarily as convenience store and gasoline station properties, and therefore may contain, or may have contained, USTs for the storage of petroleum products and other hazardous or toxic substances, which creates a potential for the release of such products or substances. Some of our properties are subject to regulations regarding the retirement and decommissioning or removal of long-lived assets including buildings containing hazardous materials, USTs and other equipment. Some of the properties may be adjacent to or near properties that have contained or currently contain USTs used to store petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, certain of the properties are on, adjacent to, or near properties upon which others have engaged or may in the future engage in activities that may release petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. There may be other environmental problems associated with our properties of which we are unaware. These problems may make it more difficult for us to re-lease or sell our properties on favorable terms, or at all.For additional information regarding pending environmental lawsuits and claims, and environmental remediation obligations and estimates, see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings”, “Environmental Matters” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Notes 3 and 5 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K.8 We enter into leases and various other agreements which contractually allocate responsibility between the parties for known and unknown environmental liabilities at or relating to the subject properties. We are contingently liable for these environmental obligations in the event that our tenant or other counterparty does not satisfy them. It is possible that our assumptions regarding the ultimate allocation method and share of responsibility that we used to allocate environmental liabilities may change, which may result in material adjustments to the amounts recorded for environmental litigation accruals and environmental remediation liabilities. We are required to accrue for environmental liabilities that we believe are allocable to others under our leases and other agreements if we determine that it is probable that our tenant or other counterparty will not meet its environmental obligations. We may ultimately be responsible to pay for environmental liabilities as the property owner if our tenant or other counterparty fails to pay them. We assess whether to accrue for environmental liabilities based upon relevant factors including our tenants’ histories of paying for such obligations, our assessment of their financial capability, and their intent to pay for such obligations. However, there can be no assurance that our assessments are correct or that our tenants who have paid their obligations in the past will continue to do so. The ultimate resolution of these matters could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.For substantially all of our triple-net leases, our tenants are contractually responsible for compliance with environmental laws and regulations, removal of USTs at the end of their lease term (the cost of which in certain cases is partially borne by us) and remediation of any environmental contamination that arises during the term of their tenancy. Under the terms of our leases covering properties previously leased to Marketing (substantially all of which commenced in 2012), we have agreed to be responsible for environmental contamination at the premises that was known at the time the lease commenced, and for environmental contamination which existed prior to commencement of the lease and is discovered (other than as a result of a voluntary site investigation) during the first 10 years of the lease term (or a shorter period for a minority of such leases). After expiration of such 10-year (or, in certain cases, shorter) period, responsibility for all newly discovered contamination, even if it relates to periods prior to commencement of the lease, is contractually allocated to our tenant. Our tenants at properties previously leased to Marketing are in all cases responsible for the cost of any remediation of contamination that results from their use and occupancy of our properties. Under substantially all of our other triple-net leases, responsibility for remediation of all environmental contamination discovered during the term of the lease (including known and unknown contamination that existed prior to commencement of the lease) is the responsibility of our tenant.We anticipate that a majority of the USTs at properties previously leased to Marketing will be replaced over the next several years because these USTs are either at or near the end of their useful lives. For long-term, triple-net leases covering sites previously leased to Marketing, our tenants are responsible for the cost of removal and replacement of USTs and for remediation of contamination found during such UST removal and replacement, unless such contamination was found during the first 10 years of the lease term and also existed prior to commencement of the lease. In those cases, we are responsible for costs associated with the remediation of such contamination. We have also agreed to be responsible for environmental contamination that existed prior to the sale of certain properties assuming the contamination is discovered (other than as a result of a voluntary site investigation) during the first five years after the sale of the properties. For properties that are vacant, we are responsible for costs associated with UST removals and for the cost of remediation of contamination found during the removal of USTs.In the course of certain UST removals and replacements at properties previously leased to Marketing where we retained continuing responsibility for preexisting environmental obligations, previously unknown environmental contamination was and continues to be discovered. As a result, we have developed a reasonable estimate of fair value for the prospective future environmental liability resulting from preexisting unknown environmental contamination and have accrued for these estimated costs. These estimates are based primarily upon quantifiable trends which we believe allow us to make reasonable estimates of fair value for the future costs of environmental remediation resulting from the removal and replacement of USTs. Our accrual of the additional liability represents our estimate of the fair value of cost for each component of the liability, net of estimated recoveries from state UST remediation funds considering estimated recovery rates developed from prior experience with the funds. In arriving at our accrual, we analyzed the ages of USTs at properties where we would be responsible for preexisting contamination found within 10 years after commencement of a lease (for properties subject to long-term triple-net leases) or five years from a sale (for divested properties), and projected a cost to closure for preexisting unknown environmental contamination.We measure our environmental remediation liabilities at fair value based on expected future net cash flows, adjusted for inflation, and then discount them to present value. We adjust our environmental remediation liabilities quarterly to reflect changes in projected expenditures, changes in present value due to the passage of time and reductions in estimated liabilities as a result of actual expenditures incurred during each quarter. As of December 31, 2018, we had accrued a total of $59.8 million for our prospective environmental remediation obligations. This accrual consisted of (a) $14.5 million, which was our estimate of reasonably estimable environmental remediation liability, including obligations to remove USTs for which we are responsible, net of estimated recoveries and (b) $45.3 million for future environmental liabilities related to preexisting unknown contamination.Environmental exposures are difficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons, including the extent of contamination, alternative treatment methods that may be applied, location of the property which subjects it to differing local laws and regulations and their interpretations, as well as the time it takes to remediate contamination and receive regulatory approval. In developing our liability for estimated environmental remediation obligations on a property by property basis, we consider, among other things, enacted laws and regulations, assessments of contamination and surrounding geology, quality of information available, currently available technologies 9 for treatment, alternative methods of remediation and prior experience. Environmental accruals are based on estimates which are subject to significant change, and are adjusted as the remediation treatment progresses, as circumstances change and as environmental contingencies become more clearly defined and reasonably estimable.Our estimates are based upon facts that are known to us at this time and an assessment of the possible ultimate remedial action outcomes. It is possible that our assumptions, which form the basis of our estimates, regarding our ultimate environmental liabilities may change, which may result in our providing an accrual, or adjustments to the amounts recorded, for environmental remediation liabilities. Among the many uncertainties that impact the estimates are our assumptions, the necessary regulatory approvals for, and potential modifications of remediation plans, the amount of data available upon initial assessment of contamination, changes in costs associated with environmental remediation services and equipment, the availability of state UST remediation funds and the possibility of existing legal claims giving rise to additional claims, and possible changes in the environmental rules and regulations, enforcement policies, and reimbursement programs of various states. Additional environmental liabilities could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.We cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations may be enacted in the future, or how existing laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted with respect to products or activities to which they have not previously been applied. We cannot predict if state UST fund programs will be administered and funded in the future in a manner that is consistent with past practices and if future environmental spending will continue to be eligible for reimbursement at historical recovery rates under these programs. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of the regulatory agencies or stricter interpretation of existing laws, which may develop in the future, could have an adverse effect on our financial position, or that of our tenants, and could require substantial additional expenditures for future remediation. Accordingly, compliance with environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.Substantially all of our tenants depend on the same industry for their revenues.We derive substantially all of our revenues from leasing, primarily on a triple-net basis, and financing convenience store and gasoline station properties to tenants in the petroleum marketing industry. Accordingly, our revenues are substantially dependent on the economic success of the petroleum marketing industry, and any factors that adversely affect that industry, such as disruption in the supply of petroleum or a decrease in the demand for conventional motor fuels due to conservation, technological advancements in petroleum-fueled motor vehicles or an increase in the use of alternative fuel and battery-operated vehicles, or other “green technologies,” could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. The success of participants in the petroleum marketing industry depends upon the sale of refined petroleum products at margins in excess of fixed and variable expenses. The petroleum marketing industry is highly competitive and volatile. Petroleum products are commodities, the prices of which depend on numerous factors that affect supply and demand. The prices paid by our tenants and other petroleum marketers for products are affected by global, national and regional factors. A large, rapid increase in wholesale petroleum prices would adversely affect the profitability and cash flows of our tenants if the increased cost of petroleum products could not be passed on to their customers or if automobile consumption of gasoline was to decline significantly. We cannot be certain as to how these factors will affect petroleum product prices or supply in the future, or how in particular they will affect our tenants.Because certain of our tenants are not rated and their financial information is not available to you, it may be difficult for our investors to determine their creditworthiness.The majority of our properties are leased to tenants who are not rated by any nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. In addition, our tenants’ financial information is not generally available to our investors. Additionally, many of our tenants are part of larger corporate organizations and we do not receive financial information for the other entities in those organizations. The financial distress of other affiliated companies or businesses in those organizations may negatively impact the ability or willingness of our tenant to perform its obligations under its lease with us. Because of the lack of financial information or credit ratings it is, therefore, difficult for our investors to assess the creditworthiness of our tenants and to determine the ability of our tenants to meet their obligations to us. It is possible that the assumptions and estimates we make after reviewing publicly and privately obtained information about our tenants are not accurate and that we may be required to increase reserves for bad debts, record allowances for deferred rent receivable or record additional expenses if our tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations to us.Our future cash flow is dependent on the performance of our tenants of their lease obligations, renewal of existing leases and either re-leasing or selling our properties.We are subject to risks that financial distress, default or bankruptcy of our tenants may lead to vacancy at our properties or disruption in rent receipts as a result of partial payment or nonpayment of rent or that expiring leases may not be renewed. Under unfavorable general economic conditions, there can be no assurance that our tenants’ level of sales and financial performance generally will not be adversely affected, which in turn could negatively impact our rental revenues. We are subject to risks that the terms governing renewal or re-leasing of our properties (including, compliance with numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations related to the 10 protection of the environment, such as the remediation of contamination and the retirement and decommissioning or removal of long-lived assets, the cost of required renovations, or replacement of USTs and related equipment) may be less favorable than current lease terms.We are also subject to the risk that we may receive less net proceeds from the properties we sell as compared to their current carrying value or that the value of our properties may be adversely affected by unfavorable general economic conditions. Unfavorable general economic conditions may also negatively impact our ability to re-lease or sell our properties. Numerous properties compete with our properties in attracting tenants to lease space. The number of available or competitive properties in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease or sell our properties and on the rents we are able to charge. In addition to the risk of disruption in rent receipts, we are subject to the risk of incurring real estate taxes, maintenance, environmental and other expenses at vacant properties. The financial distress, default or bankruptcy of our tenants may also lead to protracted and expensive processes for retaking control of our properties than would otherwise be the case, including, eviction or other legal proceedings related to or resulting from the tenant’s default. These risks are greater with respect to certain of our tenants who lease multiple properties from us. If a tenant files for bankruptcy protection it is possible that we would recover substantially less than the full value of our claims against the tenant. If (i) our tenants do not perform their lease obligations, (ii) we are unable to renew existing leases and promptly recapture and re-lease or sell our properties, (iii) lease terms upon renewal or re-leasing are less favorable than current or historical lease terms, (iv) the values of properties that we sell are adversely affected by market conditions, or (v) we incur significant costs or disruption related to or resulting from tenant financial distress, default or bankruptcy, then our cash flow could be significantly adversely affected.We are dependent on external sources of capital which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.We are dependent on external sources of capital to maintain our status as a REIT and must distribute to our stockholders each year at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding any net capital gain. Because of these distribution requirements, it is not likely that we will be able to fund all future capital needs, including acquisitions, from income from operations. Therefore, we will have to continue to rely on third-party sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. We may need to access the capital markets in order to execute future significant acquisitions. There can be no assurance that sources of capital will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.Our principal sources of liquidity are the cash flows from our operations, funds available under our $300.0 million senior unsecured credit agreement (as amended, the “Restated Credit Agreement”), with a group of commercial banks led by Bank of America, N.A. (the “Bank Syndicate”), proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock through offerings, from time to time, under our at-the-market program (“ATM Program”) and available cash and cash equivalents. The Restated Credit Agreement consists of a $250.0 million unsecured revolving facility (the “Revolving Facility”), which is scheduled to mature in March 2022 and a $50.0 million unsecured term loan (the “Term Loan”), which is scheduled to mature in March 2023. Subject to the terms of the Restated Credit Agreement and our continued compliance with its provisions, we have the option to (a) extend the term of the Revolving Facility for one additional year to March 2023 and (b) request that the lenders approve an increase of up to $300.0 million in the amount of the Revolving Facility and/or Term Loan to $600.0 million in the aggregate. On June 21, 2018, we entered into a third amended and restated note purchase and guarantee agreement (the “Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement”) amending and restating our existing senior note purchase agreement with The Prudential Insurance Company of America (“Prudential”) and certain of its affiliates. Pursuant to the Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement, we agreed that our (a) 6.0% Series A Guaranteed Senior Notes due February 25, 2021, in the original aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million (the “Series A Notes”), (b) 5.35% Series B Guaranteed Senior Notes due June 2, 2023, in the original aggregate principal amount of $75.0 million (the “Series B Notes”), and (c) 4.75% Series C Guaranteed Senior Notes due February 25, 2025, in the aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million (the “Series C Notes”), that were outstanding under the existing senior note purchase agreement would continue to remain outstanding under the Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement and we authorized and issued our 5.47% Series D Guaranteed Senior Notes due June 21, 2028, in the aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million (the “Series D Notes” and, together with the Series A Notes, the Series B Notes and the Series C Notes, the “Notes”). The Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement does not provide for scheduled reductions in the principal balance of the Notes prior to their respective maturities.On June 21, 2018, we entered into a note purchase and guarantee agreement (the “MetLife Note Purchase Agreement”) with the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (“MetLife”) and certain of its affiliates. Pursuant to the MetLife Note Purchase Agreement, we authorized and issued our 5.47% Series E Guaranteed Senior Notes due June 21, 2028, in the aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million (the “Series E Notes”). The MetLife Note Purchase Agreement does not provide for scheduled reductions in the principal balance of the Series E Notes prior to its maturity.On September 19, 2018, we entered into an amendment (the “Amendment”) of our Restated Credit Agreement. The Amendment modifies the Restated Credit Agreement to, among other things: (i) reflect that we had previously entered into the Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement and the MetLife Note Purchase Agreement and (ii) permit borrowings under each of the Revolving Facility and the Term Loan at three different interest rates, including a rate based on the LIBOR Daily Floating Rate (as defined in the 11 Amendment) plus the Applicable Rate (as defined in the Amendment) for such facility. For additional information, see “Credit Agreement” and “Senior Unsecured Notes” in Note 4 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K.The Restated Credit Agreement, the Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement and the MetLife Note Purchase Agreement contain customary financial covenants such as leverage, coverage ratios and minimum tangible net worth, as well as limitations on restricted payments, which may limit our ability to incur additional debt or pay dividends. The Restated Credit Agreement, the Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement and the MetLife Note Purchase Agreement also contain customary events of default, including cross defaults to each other, change of control and failure to maintain REIT status (provided that the Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement and the MetLife Note Purchase Agreement require a mandatory offer to prepay the Notes and the Series E Notes, respectively, upon a change in control in lieu of a change of control event of default). Our ability to meet the terms of the agreements is dependent upon our continued ability to meet certain criteria, as further described in Note 4 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K, the performance of our tenants and the other risks described in this section. If we are not in compliance with one or more of our covenants, which could result in an event of default under our Restated Credit Agreement, our Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement or our MetLife Note Purchase Agreement, there can be no assurance that our lenders would waive such non-compliance. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.Under our ATM Program, we may issue and sell shares of our common stock with an aggregate sales price of up to $125.0 million through a consortium of banks acting as agents. Sales of shares of our common stock under our ATM Program may be made from time to time in at-the-market offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, including by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or as otherwise agreed to with the applicable agent. Sales of shares of our common stock under our ATM Program, if any, will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including among others, market conditions and the trading price of our common stock. Our agents are not required to sell any specific number or dollar amount of our common stock, but each agent will use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices and applicable law and regulation to sell shares designated by us in accordance with the terms of the distribution agreement with our agents. The net proceeds we receive will be the gross proceeds received from such sales less the commissions and any other costs we may incur in issuing the shares of our common stock.We may use a portion of the net proceeds from any of such sales to reduce our outstanding indebtedness, including borrowings under our Revolving Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility includes lenders who are affiliates of our agents. As a result, a portion of the net proceeds from any sale of shares of our common stock under our ATM Program that is used to repay amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility will be received by these affiliates. Because an affiliate may receive a portion of the net proceeds from any of these sales, each of our agents may have an interest in these sales beyond the sales commission it will receive. This could result in a conflict of interest and cause such agents to act in a manner that is not in the best interests of us or our investors in connection with any sale of shares of our common stock under our ATM Program.Our access to third-party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors including general market conditions, the market’s perception of our growth potential, financial stability, our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions, covenants and limitations imposed under our Restated Credit Agreement, our Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement and our MetLife Note Purchase Agreement and the market price of our common stock.We are exposed to counterparty risk and there can be no assurances that we will effectively manage or mitigate this risk.We regularly interact with counterparties in various industries. The types of counterparties most common to our transactions and agreements include, but are not limited to, landlords, tenants, vendors and lenders. We also enter into agreements to acquire and sell properties which allocate responsibility for certain costs to the counterparty. Our most significant counterparties include, but are not limited to, the members of the Bank Syndicate related to our Restated Credit Agreement, the lender that is the counterparty to the Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement, the lender that is the counterparty to the MetLife Note Purchase Agreement and our major tenants from whom we derive a significant amount of rental revenue. The default, insolvency or other inability or unwillingness of a significant counterparty to perform its obligations under an agreement, including, without limitation, as a result of the rejection of an agreement in bankruptcy proceedings, is likely to have a material adverse effect on us. As of December 31, 2018, we leased 157 convenience store and gasoline station properties in three separate unitary leases and three stand-alone leases to subsidiaries of Global. In the aggregate, our leases with subsidiaries of Global represented 17% and 21% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. All of our unitary leases with subsidiaries of Global are guaranteed by the parent company. As of December 31, 2018, we leased 77 convenience store and gasoline station properties in three separate unitary leases to United Oil. In the aggregate, our leases with United Oil represented 13% and 15% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, we leased 76 convenience store and gasoline station properties in two separate unitary leases to subsidiaries of Chestnut. In the aggregate, our leases with subsidiaries of Chestnut represented 11% and 13% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The largest of these unitary leases, covering 57 of our properties, is guaranteed by the parent company, its principals and numerous Chestnut affiliates.12 We may also undertake additional transactions with these or other existing tenants, which would further concentrate our sources of rental revenues. Many of our tenants, including those noted above, are part of larger corporate organizations and the financial distress of one subsidiary or other affiliated companies or businesses in those organizations may negatively impact the ability or willingness of our tenant to perform its obligations under its lease with us. The failure of a major tenant or their default in their rental and other obligations to us is likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial position and results of operations, and they require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain.Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial position and results of operations. We have identified several accounting policies as being critical to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations because they require management to make particularly subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be recorded under different conditions or using different assumptions. We cannot provide any assurance that we will not make subsequent significant adjustments to our consolidated financial statements. Estimates, judgments and assumptions underlying our consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, receivables and related reserves, deferred rent receivable, income under direct financing leases, asset retirement obligations (including environmental remediation obligations and future environmental liabilities for pre-existing unknown environmental contamination), real estate, depreciation and amortization, carrying value of our properties, impairment of long-lived assets, litigation, accrued liabilities, income taxes and allocation of the purchase price of properties acquired to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If our accounting policies, methods, judgments, assumptions, estimates and allocations prove to be incorrect, or if circumstances change, our business, financial condition, revenues, operating expense, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price may be materially adversely affected.We may not be able to successfully implement our investment strategy.We may not be able to successfully implement our investment strategy. We cannot assure you that our portfolio of properties will expand at all, or if it will expand at any specified rate or to any specified size. As part of our overall growth strategy, we regularly review acquisition, financing and redevelopment opportunities, and we expect to continue to pursue investments that we believe will benefit our financial performance. We cannot assure you that investment opportunities which meet our investment criteria will be available. Pursuing our investment opportunities may result in additional debt or new equity issuances, that may initially be dilutive to our net income, and such investments may not perform as we expect or produce the returns that we anticipate (including, without limitation, as a result of tenant bankruptcies, tenant concessions, our inability to collect rents and higher than anticipated operating expenses). Further, we may not be able to successfully integrate investments into our existing portfolio without operating disruptions or unanticipated costs. To the extent that our current sources of liquidity are not sufficient to fund such investments, we will require other sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Additionally, to the extent that we increase the size of our portfolio, we may not be able to adapt our management, administrative, accounting and operational systems, or hire and retain sufficient operational staff to integrate investments into our portfolio or manage any future investments without operating disruptions or unanticipated costs. Moreover, our continued growth will require increased investment in management personnel, professional fees, other personnel, financial and management systems and controls and facilities, which will result in additional operating expenses. Under the circumstances described above, our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects may be materially adversely affected.We may acquire new properties and this may create risks.We may acquire properties when we believe that an acquisition matches our business and investment strategies. These properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential. It is possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline after we acquire them, or that they may not perform as expected. Further, if financed by additional debt or new equity issuances, our acquisition of properties may result in stockholder dilution. Our acquisition of properties will expose us to the liabilities of those properties, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of such acquisitions. We face competition in pursuing these acquisitions and we may not succeed in leasing acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of their acquisition and operations.Newly acquired properties may require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. We may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions. Consequences arising from or in connection with any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.We are pursuing redevelopment opportunities and this creates risks to our Company.We have commenced a program to redevelop certain of our properties, and to recapture select properties from our net lease portfolio in order to redevelop such properties, to either a new convenience and gasoline use or for alternative single-tenant net lease retail uses. The success at each stage of our redevelopment program is dependent on numerous factors and risks, including our ability 13 to identify and extract qualified sites from our portfolio and successfully prepare and market them for alternative uses, and project development issues, including those relating to planning, zoning, licensing, permitting, third party and governmental authorizations, changes in local market conditions, increases in construction costs, the availability and cost of financing, and issues arising from possible discovery of new environmental contamination and the need to conduct environmental remediation. Occupancy rates and rents at any particular redeveloped property may fail to meet our original expectations for reasons beyond our control, including changes in market and economic conditions and the development by competitors of competing properties. We could experience increased and unexpected costs or significant delays or abandonment of some or all of these redevelopment opportunities. For any of the above-described reasons, and others, we may determine to abandon opportunities that we have already begun to explore or with respect to which we have commenced redevelopment efforts and, as a result, we may fail to recover expenses already incurred. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully redevelop and lease any of our identified opportunities or that our overall redevelopment program will be successful. Consequences arising from or in connection with any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.We are exposed to interest rate risk and there can be no assurances that we will manage or mitigate this risk effectively.We are exposed to interest rate risk, primarily as a result of our Restated Credit Agreement. Borrowings under our Restated Credit Agreement bear interest at a floating rate. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates will increase the amount of interest we must pay under our Restated Credit Agreement. Our interest rate risk may materially change in the future if we increase our borrowings under the Restated Credit Agreement or amend our Restated Credit Agreement, our Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement or our MetLife Note Purchase Agreement, seek other sources of debt or equity capital or refinance our outstanding indebtedness. A significant increase in interest rates could also make it more difficult to find alternative financing on desirable terms. For additional information with respect to interest rate risk, see “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in this Form 10-K.We are subject to risks inherent in owning and leasing real estate.We are subject to varying degrees of risk generally related to leasing and owning real estate, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to general risks applicable to us, our risks include, among others: our liability as a lessee for long-term lease obligations regardless of our revenues; deterioration in national, regional and local economic and real estate market conditions; potential changes in supply of, or demand for, rental properties similar to ours; competition for tenants and declining rental rates; difficulty in selling or re-leasing properties on favorable terms or at all; impairments in our ability to collect rent or other payments due to us when they are due; increases in interest rates and adverse changes in the availability, cost and terms of financing; uninsured property liability; the impact of present or future environmental legislation and compliance with environmental laws; adverse changes in zoning laws and other regulations; acts of terrorism and war; acts of God; the unforeseen impacts of climate change, compliance with any future laws or regulations designed to prevent or mitigate the impacts of climate change, and any material costs related thereto; the potential risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time the need to periodically renovate and repair our properties; and physical or weather-related damage to our properties. Certain significant expenditures generally do not change in response to economic or other conditions, including: (i) debt service, (ii) real estate taxes, (iii) environmental remediation costs and (iv) operating and maintenance costs. The combination of variable revenue and relatively fixed expenditures may result, under certain market conditions, in reduced earnings and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.Each of the factors listed above could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. In addition, real estate investments are relatively illiquid, which means that our ability to vary our portfolio of properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be limited.Our business operations may not generate sufficient cash for distributions or debt service.There is no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay dividends on our common stock, to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may not be able to repay or refinance existing indebtedness on favorable terms, which could force us to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms (which may also result in losses) or accept financing on unfavorable terms.Adverse developments in general business, economic or political conditions could have a material adverse effect on us.Adverse developments in general business and economic conditions, including through recession, downturn or otherwise, either in the economy generally or in those regions in which a large portion of our business is conducted, could have a material adverse effect on us and significantly increase certain of the risks we are subject to. Among other effects, adverse economic conditions could depress real estate values, impact our ability to re-lease or sell our properties and have an adverse effect on our tenants’ level of sales and financial performance generally. As our revenues are substantially dependent on the economic success of our tenants, any factors that adversely impact our tenants could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.14 Inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Although inflation has not materially impacted our results of operations in the recent past, increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations. During times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, as provided for in our leases, rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation. Likewise, even though our triple-net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation, substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue, which may adversely affect our tenants’ ability to pay rent.Recently enacted U.S. federal tax reform legislation could affect REITs generally, our tenants, the markets in which we operate, the price of our common stock and our results of operations, in ways, both positively and negatively, that are difficult to predict.On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Act”) was enacted. The 2017 Act includes significant changes to corporate and individual tax rates and the calculation of taxes. As a REIT, we are generally not required to pay federal taxes otherwise applicable to regular corporations if we distribute all of our income and comply with the various tax rules governing REITs. Stockholders, however, are generally required to pay taxes on REIT dividends. The 2017 Act changes the way in which dividends paid on our stock are taxed by the holder of that stock and could impact the price of our common stock or how stockholders and potential investors view an investment in REITs. In addition, while certain elements of the 2017 Act do not appear to impact us directly as a REIT, they could impact our tenants and the markets in which we operate in ways, both positive and negative, that are difficult to predict. Prospective stockholders are urged to consult with their tax advisors with respect to the 2017 Act and any other regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and the potential effects thereof on an investment in our common stock.Property taxes on our properties may increase without notice.Each of the properties we own or lease is subject to real property taxes. The leases for certain of the properties that we lease from third-parties obligate us to pay real property taxes with regard to those properties. The real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we acquire or lease in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities. To the extent that our tenants are unable or unwilling to pay such increase in accordance with their leases, our net operating expenses may increase.We are defending pending lawsuits and claims and are subject to material losses.We are subject to various lawsuits and claims, including litigation related to environmental matters, such as those arising from leaking USTs, contamination of groundwater with methyl tertiary butyl ether (a fuel derived from methanol, commonly referred to as “MTBE”) and releases of motor fuel into the environment, and toxic tort claims. The ultimate resolution of certain matters cannot be predicted because considerable uncertainty exists both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimate of such loss. Our ultimate liabilities resulting from the lawsuits and claims we face could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. For additional information with respect to certain pending lawsuits and claims, see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” and Note 3 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K.A significant portion of our properties are concentrated in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, and adverse conditions in those regions, in particular, could negatively impact our operations.A significant portion of the properties we own and lease are located in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States and, as of December 31, 2018, 47.5% of our properties are concentrated in three states (New York, Massachusetts and Connecticut). Because of the concentration of our properties in those regions, in the event of adverse economic conditions in those regions, we would likely experience higher risk of default on payment of rent to us than if our properties were more geographically diversified. Additionally, the rents on our properties may be subject to a greater risk of default than other properties in the event of adverse economic, political or business developments, natural disasters or severe weather that may affect the Northeast or Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States and the ability of our lessees to make rent payments. This lack of geographical diversification could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.We are in a competitive business.The real estate industry is highly competitive. Where we own properties, we compete for tenants with a large number of real estate property owners and other companies that sublet properties. Our principal means of competition are rents we are able to charge in relation to the income producing potential of the location. In addition, we expect other major real estate investors, some with much greater financial resources or more experienced personnel than we have, will compete with us for attractive acquisition opportunities. These competitors include petroleum manufacturing, distributing and marketing companies, convenience store retailers, other REITs, public and private investment funds, and other individual and institutional investors. This competition has increased prices for properties we seek to acquire and may impair our ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms in the future.15 We are subject to losses that may not be covered by insurance.We and our tenants carry insurance against certain risks and in such amounts as we believe are customary for businesses of our kind. However, as the costs and availability of insurance change, we may decide not to be covered against certain losses (such as certain environmental liabilities, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and civil disorder) where, in the judgment of management, the insurance is not warranted due to cost or availability of coverage or the remoteness of perceived risk. Furthermore, there are certain types of losses, such as losses resulting from wars, terrorism or certain acts of God, that generally are not insured because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. There is no assurance that the existing insurance coverages are or will be sufficient to cover actual losses incurred. The destruction of, or significant damage to, or significant liabilities arising out of conditions at, our properties due to an uninsured loss would result in an economic loss and could result in us losing both our investment in, and anticipated profits from, such properties. When a loss is insured, the coverage may be insufficient in amount or duration, or a lessee’s customers may be lost, such that the lessee cannot resume its business after the loss at prior levels or at all, resulting in reduced rent or a default under its lease. Any such loss relating to a large number of properties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.Failure to qualify as a REIT under the federal income tax laws would have adverse consequences to our stockholders. Uncertain tax matters may have a significant impact on the results of operations for any single fiscal year or interim period or may cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT.We elected to be treated as a REIT under the federal income tax laws beginning January 1, 2001. To qualify for taxation as a REIT, we must, among other requirements such as those related to the composition of our assets and gross income, distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income, including taxable income that is accrued by us without a corresponding receipt of cash. Accordingly, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on qualifying REIT income, provided that distributions to our stockholders equal at least the amount of our taxable income as defined under the Internal Revenue Code. But, we may have to borrow money or sell assets to satisfy such distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. Many of the REIT requirements are highly technical and complex. If we were to fail to meet the requirements, we may be subject to federal income tax, excise taxes, penalties and interest or we may have to pay a deficiency dividend. We may have to borrow money or sell assets to pay such a deficiency dividend.We cannot guarantee that we will continue to qualify in the future as a REIT. We cannot give any assurance that new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the requirements relating to our qualification. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and will again be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates, we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax for taxable years beginning before 2018, we could be required to pay significant income taxes and we would have less money available for our operations and distributions to stockholders. This would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities. We could also be precluded from treatment as a REIT for four taxable years following the year in which we lost the qualification, and all distributions to stockholders would be taxable as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Loss of our REIT status could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.Future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our equity securities.Our future growth depends upon our ability to raise additional capital. If we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities, such issuance, the receipt of the net proceeds thereof and the use of such proceeds may have a dilutive effect on our expected earnings per share, funds from operations per share and adjusted funds from operations per share. The actual amount of such dilution cannot be determined at this time and will be based on numerous factors. Additionally, we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or preferred stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities in the future. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market after an offering or the perception that such sales could occur.We may change our dividend policy and the dividends we pay may be subject to significant volatility.The decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon such factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant and the dividend paid may vary from expected amounts. Any change in our dividend policy could adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock. In addition, each of the Restated Credit Agreement, the Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement and the MetLife Note Purchase Agreement prohibit the payments of dividends during certain events of default. No assurance can be given that our financial performance in the future will permit our payment of any dividends or that the amount of dividends we pay, if any, will not fluctuate significantly. Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, our ability to pay dividends would be restricted if, after payment of the dividend, (i) we would not be able to pay indebtedness as it becomes due 16 in the usual course of business or (ii) our total assets would be less than the sum of our liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if we were to be dissolved, to satisfy the rights of any stockholders with liquidation preferences. There currently are no stockholders with liquidation preferences. No assurance can be given that our financial performance in the future will permit our payment of any dividends. Each of the Restated Credit Agreement, the Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement and the MetLife Note Purchase Agreement contain customary financial covenants such as availability, leverage and coverage ratios and minimum tangible net worth, as well as limitations on restricted payments, which may limit our ability to incur additional debt or pay dividends. As a result of the factors described above, we may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis, which could materially and adversely affect our business, stock price and ability to pay dividends.Changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded common stock.As with other publicly traded securities, the market price of our publicly traded common stock depends on various market conditions, which may change from time-to-time. Among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded common stock are the following: our financial condition and performance and that of our significant tenants; the market’s perception of our growth potential and potential future earnings; the reputation of REITs generally and the reputation of REITs with portfolios similar to us; the attractiveness of the securities of REITs in comparison to securities issued by other entities (including securities issued by other real estate companies); an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for publicly traded securities; the extent of institutional investor interest in us; and general economic and financial market conditions.In order to preserve our REIT status, our charter limits the number of shares a person may own, which may discourage a takeover that could result in a premium price for our common stock or otherwise benefit our stockholders.Our charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our Board of Directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Unless exempted by our Board of Directors, no person may (i) own, or be deemed to own by virtue of certain constructive ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, in excess of 5.0% (in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our common stock or (ii) own, or be deemed to own by virtue of certain other constructive ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, in excess of 9.9% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding shares of our common stock, which may discourage large investors from purchasing our stock. This restriction may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all of our assets) that might provide a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders.Maryland law may discourage a third-party from acquiring us.We are subject to the provisions of the Maryland Business Combination Act (the “Business Combination Act”) which prohibits transactions between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Generally, pursuant to the Business Combination Act, an “interested stockholder” is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of a Maryland corporation’s voting stock. These provisions could have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of our Company or reducing the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our capital stock. Additionally, the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act may deny voting rights to shares involved in an acquisition of one-tenth or more of the voting stock of a Maryland corporation. In our charter and bylaws, we have elected not to have the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act apply to any acquisition by any person of shares of stock of our Company. However, in the case of the control share acquisition statute, our Board of Directors may opt to make this statute applicable to us at any time by amending our bylaws, and may do so on a retroactive basis. Finally, the “unsolicited takeovers” provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law permit our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to implement certain provisions that may have the effect of inhibiting a third-party from making an acquisition proposal for our Company or of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our Company under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price or that stockholders may otherwise believe is in their best interests.The loss of certain members of our management team or Board of Directors could adversely affect our business or the market price of our common stock.Our future success and ability to implement our business and investment strategy depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key management personnel and directors, and on the continued contributions of such persons, each of whom may be difficult to replace. As a REIT, we employ only 29 employees and have a cost-effective management structure. We do not have any employment agreements with any of our executives. In the event of the loss of key management personnel or directors, or upon unexpected death, 17 disability or retirement, we may not be able to find replacements with comparable skill, ability and industry expertise, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. Additionally, certain of our directors beneficially own more than 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If any of these directors cease to be a director of the Company and they or their estate sell a significant portion of such holdings into the public market, it could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.Amendments to the Accounting Standards Codification made by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) or changes in accounting standards issued by other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability or financial position.Our consolidated financial statements are subject to the application of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification, which is periodically amended by the FASB. The application of GAAP is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, we are required to adopt amendments to the Accounting Standards Codification or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time-to-time by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB and the SEC. Those changes could adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability or financial position.Our assets may be subject to impairment charges.We periodically evaluate our real estate investments and other assets for impairment indicators. The judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on GAAP, and includes a variety of factors such as market conditions, the accumulation of asset retirement costs due to changes in estimates associated with our estimated environmental liabilities, the status of significant leases, the financial condition of major tenants and other assumptions and factors that could affect the cash flow from or fair value of our properties. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we incurred $6.2 million and $9.3 million, respectively, of impairment charges. We may be required to take similar impairment charges, which could affect the implementation of our current business strategy and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the market on which our common stock trades, the markets in which we operate, our operations and our results of operations.Terrorist attacks or other acts of violence or war could affect our business or the businesses of our tenants. The consequences of armed conflicts are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. More generally, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States and worldwide financial markets and economy. Terrorist attacks also could be a factor resulting in, or which could exacerbate, an economic recession in the United States or abroad. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.We rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business.We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, including financial transactions and maintenance of records, which may include personal identifying information of tenants and lease data. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting and storing confidential tenant information, such as individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts. Although we have taken steps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems, it is possible that our security measures will not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning, or the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyberattacks. Security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect us.If we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately and timely report our financial results.Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, effectively prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. We are required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.As a result of material weaknesses or significant deficiencies that may be identified in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may also identify certain deficiencies in some of our disclosure controls and procedures that we believe require 18 remediation. If we or our independent registered public accounting firm discover any such weaknesses or deficiencies, we will make efforts to further improve our internal control over financial reporting controls. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful. Any failure to maintain effective controls or timely effect any necessary improvement of our internal control over financial reporting controls could harm operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, which could affect the listing of our common stock on the NYSE. Ineffective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the per share trading price of our common stock.We may be adversely affected by changes in LIBOR reporting practices or the method in which LIBOR is calculated.On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly-created index, calculated by reference to short-term repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasury securities, called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). The first publication of SOFR was released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in April 2018. Whether SOFR will become a widely-accepted benchmark in place of LIBOR, however, remains in question. As such, the future of LIBOR and potential alternatives thereto are uncertain at this time. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate our Restated Credit Agreement, which extends beyond 2021, to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established. The potential effects of the foregoing on our cost of capital cannot yet be determined"
13,GTY,GETTY REALTY CORP,2018-03-01,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
We are subject to various risks, many of which are beyond our control. As a result of these and other factors, we may experience material fluctuations in our future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. An investment in our stock involves various risks, including those mentioned below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and those that are described from time to time in our other filings with the SEC.We incur significant operating costs as a result of environmental laws and regulations which costs could significantly rise and reduce our profitability.We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, including matters relating to the protection of the environment. Under certain environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at, on, or under, such property, and may be required to investigate and clean-up such contamination. Such laws typically impose liability and clean-up responsibility first on the party responsible for the contamination, but can also impose liability and clean-up responsibility on the owner and the current operator without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants, or the timing or cause of the contamination. Liability under such environmental laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility and the financial resources are available to perform the remediation. For example, liability may arise as a result of the historical use of a property or from the migration of contamination from adjacent or nearby properties. Any such contamination or liability may also reduce the value of the property. In addition, the owner or operator of a property may be subject to claims by third-parties based on injury, damage and/or costs, including investigation and clean-up costs, resulting from environmental contamination present at or emanating from a property. The properties owned or controlled by us are leased primarily as convenience store and gasoline station properties, and therefore may contain, or may have contained, USTs for the storage of petroleum products and other hazardous or toxic substances, which creates a potential for the release of such products or substances. Some of our properties are subject to regulations regarding the retirement and decommissioning or removal of long-lived assets including buildings containing hazardous materials, USTs and other equipment. Some of the properties may be adjacent to or near properties that have contained or currently contain USTs used to store petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, certain of the properties are on, adjacent to, or near properties upon which others have engaged or may in the future engage in activities that may release petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. There may be other environmental problems associated with our properties of which we are unaware. These problems may make it more difficult for us to re-lease or sell our properties on favorable terms, or at all.8 For additional information with respect to certain pending environmental lawsuits and claims, and environmental remediation obligations and estimates, see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings”, “Environmental Matters” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Notes 3 and 5 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K.We enter into leases and various other agreements which contractually allocate responsibility between the parties for known and unknown environmental liabilities at or relating to the subject properties. We are contingently liable for these environmental obligations in the event that our tenant or other counterparty does not satisfy them. It is possible that our assumptions regarding the ultimate allocation method and share of responsibility that we used to allocate environmental liabilities may change, which may result in material adjustments to the amounts recorded for environmental litigation accruals and environmental remediation liabilities. We are required to accrue for environmental liabilities that we believe are allocable to others under our leases and other agreements if we determine that it is probable that our tenant or other counterparty will not meet its environmental obligations. We may ultimately be responsible to pay for environmental liabilities as the property owner if our tenant or other counterparty fails to pay them. We assess whether to accrue for environmental liabilities based upon relevant factors including our tenants’ histories of paying for such obligations, our assessment of their financial capability, and their intent to pay for such obligations. However, there can be no assurance that our assessments are correct or that our tenants who have paid their obligations in the past will continue to do so. The ultimate resolution of these matters could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.For substantially all of our triple-net leases, our tenants are contractually responsible for compliance with environmental laws and regulations, removal of USTs at the end of their lease term (the cost of which in certain cases is partially borne by us) and remediation of any environmental contamination that arises during the term of their tenancy. Under the terms of our leases covering properties previously leased to Marketing (substantially all of which commenced in 2012), we have agreed to be responsible for environmental contamination at the premises that was known at the time the lease commenced, and for environmental contamination discovered (other than as a result of a voluntary site investigation) during the first 10 years of the lease term (or a shorter period for a minority of such leases). After expiration of such 10-year (or, in certain cases, shorter) period, responsibility for all newly discovered contamination, even if it relates to periods prior to commencement of the lease, is contractually allocated to our tenant. Our tenants at properties previously leased to Marketing are in all cases responsible for the cost of any remediation of contamination that results from their use and occupancy of our properties. Under substantially all of our other triple-net leases, responsibility for remediation of all environmental contamination discovered during the term of the lease (including known and unknown contamination that existed prior to commencement of the lease) is the responsibility of our tenant.We anticipate that a majority of the USTs at properties previously leased to Marketing will be replaced over the next several years because these USTs are either at or near the end of their useful lives. For long-term, triple-net leases covering sites previously leased to Marketing, our tenants are responsible for the cost of removal and replacement of USTs and for remediation of contamination found during such UST removal and replacement, unless such contamination was found during the first 10 years of the lease term and also existed prior to commencement of the lease. In those cases, we are responsible for costs associated with the remediation of such contamination. We have also agreed to be responsible for environmental contamination that existed prior to the sale of certain properties assuming the contamination is discovered (other than as a result of a voluntary site investigation) during the first five years after the sale of the properties. For properties that are vacant, we are responsible for costs associated with UST removals and for the cost of remediation of contamination found during the removal of USTs.In the course of certain UST removals and replacements at properties previously leased to Marketing where we retained continuing responsibility for preexisting environmental obligations, previously unknown environmental contamination was and continues to be discovered. As a result, we have developed a reasonable estimate of fair value for the prospective future environmental liability resulting from preexisting unknown environmental contamination and have accrued for these estimated costs. These estimates are based primarily upon quantifiable trends which we believe allow us to make reasonable estimates of fair value for the future costs of environmental remediation resulting from the removal and replacement of USTs. Our accrual of the additional liability represents the best estimate of the fair value of cost for each component of the liability, net of estimated recoveries from state UST remediation funds considering estimated recovery rates developed from prior experience with the funds. In arriving at our accrual, we analyzed the ages of USTs at properties where we would be responsible for preexisting contamination found within 10 years after commencement of a lease (for properties subject to long-term triple-net leases) or five years from a sale (for divested properties), and projected a cost to closure for new environmental contamination.We measure our environmental remediation liability at fair value based on expected future net cash flows, adjusted for inflation, and then discount them to present value. We adjust our environmental remediation liability quarterly to reflect changes in projected expenditures, changes in present value due to the passage of time and reductions in estimated liabilities as a result of actual expenditures incurred during each quarter. As of December 31, 2017, we had accrued a total of $63.6 million for our prospective environmental remediation obligations. This accrual consisted of (a) $18.6 million, which was our best estimate of reasonably estimable environmental remediation liability, including obligations to remove USTs for which we are responsible, net of estimated recoveries and (b) $45.0 million for future environmental liabilities related to preexisting unknown contamination.9 Environmental exposures are difficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons, including the extent of contamination, alternative treatment methods that may be applied, location of the property which subjects it to differing local laws and regulations and their interpretations, as well as the time it takes to remediate contamination and receive regulatory approval. In developing our liability for estimated environmental remediation obligations on a property by property basis, we consider, among other things, enacted laws and regulations, assessments of contamination and surrounding geology, quality of information available, currently available technologies for treatment, alternative methods of remediation and prior experience. Environmental accruals are based on estimates which are subject to significant change, and are adjusted as the remediation treatment progresses, as circumstances change and as environmental contingencies become more clearly defined and reasonably estimable.Our estimates are based upon facts that are known to us at this time and an assessment of the possible ultimate remedial action outcomes. It is possible that our assumptions, which form the basis of our estimates, regarding our ultimate environmental liabilities may change, which may result in our providing an accrual, or adjustments to the amounts recorded, for environmental remediation liabilities. Among the many uncertainties that impact the estimates are our assumptions, the necessary regulatory approvals for, and potential modifications of remediation plans, the amount of data available upon initial assessment of contamination, changes in costs associated with environmental remediation services and equipment, the availability of state UST remediation funds and the possibility of existing legal claims giving rise to additional claims, and possible changes in the environmental rules and regulations, enforcement policies, and reimbursement programs of various states. Additional environmental liabilities could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.We cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations may be enacted in the future, or how existing laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted with respect to products or activities to which they have not previously been applied. We cannot predict if state UST fund programs will be administered and funded in the future in a manner that is consistent with past practices and if future environmental spending will continue to be eligible for reimbursement at historical recovery rates under these programs. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of the regulatory agencies or stricter interpretation of existing laws, which may develop in the future, could have an adverse effect on our financial position, or that of our tenants, and could require substantial additional expenditures for future remediation. Accordingly, compliance with environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.We are exposed to counterparty risk and there can be no assurances that we will effectively manage or mitigate this risk.We regularly interact with counterparties in various industries. The types of counterparties most common to our transactions and agreements include, but are not limited to, landlords, tenants, vendors and lenders. We also enter into agreements to acquire and sell properties which allocate responsibility for certain costs to the counterparty. Our most significant counterparties include, but are not limited to, the members of the Bank Syndicate related to our Credit Agreement, the lender that is the counterparty to the Second Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement and our major tenants from whom we derive a significant amount of rental revenue. The default, insolvency or other inability or unwillingness of a significant counterparty to perform its obligations under an agreement, including, without limitation, as a result of the rejection of an agreement in bankruptcy proceedings, is likely to have a material adverse effect on us. As of December 31, 2017, we leased 163 convenience store and gasoline station properties in three separate unitary leases and three stand-alone leases to subsidiaries of Global Partners LP (NYSE: GLP) (“Global Partners”). In the aggregate, our leases with subsidiaries of Global Partners represented 21% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. All of our unitary leases with subsidiaries of Global Partners are guaranteed by the parent company. As of December 31, 2017, we leased 77 convenience store and gasoline station properties in three separate unitary leases to Apro, LLC (d/b/a “United Oil”). In the aggregate, our leases with United Oil represented 15% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. As of December 31, 2017, we leased 76 convenience store and gasoline station properties in two separate unitary leases to subsidiaries of Chestnut Petroleum Dist. Inc. (“Chestnut Petroleum”). In the aggregate, our leases with subsidiaries of Chestnut Petroleum represented 13% and 15% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The largest of these unitary leases, covering 57 of our properties, is guaranteed by the parent company, its principals and numerous Chestnut Petroleum affiliates.We may also undertake additional transactions with these or other existing tenants, which would further concentrate our sources of rental revenues. Many of our tenants, including those noted above, are part of larger corporate organizations and the financial distress of one subsidiary or other affiliated companies or businesses in those organizations may negatively impact the ability or willingness of our tenant to perform its obligations under its lease with us. The failure of a major tenant or their default in their rental and other obligations to us is likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.10 Because certain of our tenants are not rated and their financial information is not available to you, it may be difficult for our investors to determine their creditworthiness.The majority of our properties are leased to tenants who are not rated by any nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. In addition, our tenants’ financial information is not generally available to our investors. Additionally, many of our tenants are part of larger corporate organizations and we do not receive financial information for the other entities in those organizations. The financial distress of other affiliated companies or businesses in those organizations may negatively impact the ability or willingness of our tenant to perform its obligations under its lease with us. Because of the lack of financial information or credit ratings it is, therefore, difficult for our investors to assess the creditworthiness of our tenants and to determine the ability of our tenants to meet their obligations to us. It is possible that the assumptions and estimates we make after reviewing publicly and privately obtained information about our tenants are not accurate and that we may be required to increase reserves for bad debts, record allowances for deferred rent receivable or record additional expenses if our tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations to us.Our future cash flow is dependent on the performance of our tenants of their lease obligations, renewal of existing leases and either re-leasing or selling our properties.We are subject to risks that financial distress, default or bankruptcy of our tenants may lead to vacancy at our properties or disruption in rent receipts as a result of partial payment or nonpayment of rent or that expiring leases may not be renewed. Under unfavorable general economic conditions, there can be no assurance that our tenants’ level of sales and financial performance generally will not be adversely affected, which in turn could negatively impact our rental revenues. We are subject to risks that the terms governing renewal or re-leasing of our properties (including, compliance with numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment, such as the remediation of contamination and the retirement and decommissioning or removal of long-lived assets, the cost of required renovations, or replacement of USTs and related equipment) may be less favorable than current lease terms.We are also subject to the risk that we may receive less net proceeds from the properties we sell as compared to their current carrying value or that the value of our properties may be adversely affected by unfavorable general economic conditions. Unfavorable general economic conditions may also negatively impact our ability to re-lease or sell our properties. Numerous properties compete with our properties in attracting tenants to lease space. The number of available or competitive properties in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease or sell our properties and on the rents we are able to charge. In addition to the risk of disruption in rent receipts, we are subject to the risk of incurring real estate taxes, maintenance, environmental and other expenses at vacant properties. The financial distress, default or bankruptcy of our tenants may also lead to protracted and expensive processes for retaking control of our properties than would otherwise be the case, including, eviction or other legal proceedings related to or resulting from the tenant’s default. These risks are greater with respect to certain of our tenants who lease multiple properties from us. If a tenant files for bankruptcy protection it is possible that we would recover substantially less than the full value of our claims against the tenant. If our tenants do not perform their lease obligations; or we are unable to renew existing leases and promptly recapture and re-lease or sell our properties; or if lease terms upon renewal or re-leasing are less favorable than current or historical lease terms; or if the values of properties that we sell are adversely affected by market conditions; or if we incur significant costs or disruption related to or resulting from tenant financial distress, default or bankruptcy; then our cash flow could be significantly adversely affected.We are dependent on external sources of capital which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.We are dependent on external sources of capital to maintain our status as a REIT and must distribute to our shareholders each year at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding any net capital gain. Because of these distribution requirements, it is not likely that we will be able to fund all future capital needs, including acquisitions, from income from operations. Therefore, we will have to continue to rely on third-party sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. We may need to access the capital markets in order to execute future significant acquisitions. There can be no assurance that sources of capital will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.Our principal sources of liquidity are the cash flows from our operations, funds available under our Credit Agreement, proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock through offerings, from time to time, under our at-the-market program (“ATM Program”) and available cash and cash equivalents. The Credit Agreement consists of a $175.0 million Revolving Facility which is scheduled to mature in June 2018 and a $50.0 million Term Loan which is scheduled to mature in June 2020. Subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement and our continued compliance with its provisions, we have the option to (a) extend the term of the Revolving Facility for one additional year to June 2019 and (b) increase by $75.0 million the amount of the Revolving Facility to $250.0 million. On February 21, 2017, we entered into a First Amendment to the Credit Agreement to permit the Second Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement. On February 21, 2017, we entered into the Second Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement which amended and restated our existing senior note purchase agreement with Prudential and certain affiliates of Prudential. Pursuant to the Second Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement, we agreed that our 6.0% Series A Guaranteed Senior Notes due February 25, 11 2021, in the original aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million (the “Series A Notes”) and our 5.35% Series B Guaranteed Senior Notes due June 2, 2023, in the original aggregate principal amount of $75.0 million (the “Series B Notes”), both of which were outstanding under the existing senior note purchase agreement, would continue to remain outstanding under the Second Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement and we authorized and issued our 4.75% Series C Guaranteed Senior Notes due February 25, 2025, in the aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million (the “Series C Notes” and, together with the Series A Notes and Series B Notes, the “Notes”). The Second Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement does not provide for scheduled reductions in the principal balance of the Notes prior to their respective maturities. For additional information, please refer to “Credit Agreement” and “Senior Unsecured Notes” in Note 4 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K.Each of the Credit Agreement and the Second Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement contain customary financial covenants such as availability, leverage and coverage ratios and minimum tangible net worth, as well as limitations on restricted payments, which may limit our ability to incur additional debt or pay dividends. The Credit Agreement and the Second Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement also contain customary events of default, including cross defaults to each other, change of control and failure to maintain REIT status (provided that the Second Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement requires a mandatory offer to prepay the Notes upon a change in control in lieu of a change of control event of default). Our ability to meet the terms of the agreements is dependent upon our continued ability to meet certain criteria, as further described in Note 4 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K, the performance of our tenants and the other risks described in this section. If we are not in compliance with one or more of our covenants, which could result in an event of default under our Credit Agreement or our Second Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement, there can be no assurance that our lenders would waive such non-compliance. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.Under our ATM Program, we may issue and sell shares of our common stock with an aggregate sales price of up to $125.0 million through a consortium of banks acting as agents. Sales of shares of our common stock under our ATM Program may be made from time to time in at-the-market offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, including by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or as otherwise agreed to with the applicable agent. Sales of shares of our common stock under our ATM Program, if any, will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including among others, market conditions and the trading price of our common stock. Our agents are not required to sell any specific number or dollar amount of our common stock, but each agent will use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices and applicable law and regulation to sell shares designated by us in accordance with the terms of the distribution agreement with our agents. The net proceeds we receive will be the gross proceeds received from such sales less the commissions and any other costs we may incur in issuing the shares of our common stock.We may use a portion of the net proceeds from any of such sales to reduce our outstanding indebtedness, including borrowings under our Revolving Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility includes lenders who are affiliates of our agents. As a result, a portion of the net proceeds from any sale of shares of our common stock under our ATM Program that is used to repay amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility will be received by these affiliates. Because an affiliate may receive a portion of the net proceeds from any of these sales, each of our agents may have an interest in these sales beyond the sales commission it will receive. This could result in a conflict of interest and cause such agents to act in a manner that is not in the best interests of us or our investors in connection with any sale of shares of our common stock under our ATM Program.Our access to third-party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors including general market conditions, the market’s perception of our growth potential, financial stability, our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions, covenants and limitations imposed under our Credit Agreement and Second Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement and the market price of our common stock.Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial position and results of operations, and they require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain.Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial position and results of operations. We have identified several accounting policies as being critical to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations because they require management to make particularly subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be recorded under different conditions or using different assumptions. We cannot provide any assurance that we will not make subsequent significant adjustments to our consolidated financial statements. Estimates, judgments and assumptions underlying our consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, receivables and related reserves, deferred rent receivable, income under direct financing leases, asset retirement obligations (including environmental remediation obligations and future environmental liabilities for pre-existing unknown environmental contamination), real estate, depreciation and amortization, carrying value of our properties, impairment of long-lived assets, litigation, accrued liabilities, income taxes and allocation of the purchase price of properties acquired to the assets acquired and liabilities 12 assumed. If our accounting policies, methods, judgments, assumptions, estimates and allocations prove to be incorrect, or if circumstances change, our business, financial condition, revenues, operating expense, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price may be materially adversely affected.Our business operations may not generate sufficient cash for distributions or debt service.There is no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay dividends on our common stock, to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may not be able to repay or refinance existing indebtedness on favorable terms, which could force us to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms (which may also result in losses) or accept financing on unfavorable terms.We may acquire new properties and this may create risks.We may acquire properties when we believe that an acquisition matches our business and investment strategies. These properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential. It is possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline after we acquire them, or that they may not perform as expected. Further, if financed by the Company using debt or new equity issuances, our acquisition of properties may result in shareholder dilution. Our acquisition of properties will expose us to the liabilities of those properties, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of such acquisitions. We face competition in pursuing these acquisitions and we may not succeed in leasing acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of their acquisition and operations.Newly acquired properties may require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. We may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions. Consequences arising from or in connection with any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.We are pursuing redevelopment opportunities and this creates risks to our Company.We have commenced a program to redevelop certain of our properties and to recapture select properties from our net lease portfolio in order to redevelop such properties either as a new convenience store or for alternative uses. The success at each stage of our redevelopment program is dependent on numerous factors and risks including our ability to identify and extract qualified sites from our portfolio and successfully prepare and market them for alternative uses, and project development issues, including those relating to planning, zoning, licensing, permitting, third party and governmental authorizations, changes in local market conditions, increases in construction costs, the availability and cost of financing, and issues arising from possible discovery of new environmental contamination and the need to conduct environmental remediation. Occupancy rates and rents at any particular redeveloped property may fail to meet our original expectations for reasons beyond our control, including changes in market and economic conditions and the development by competitors of competing properties. We could experience increased and unexpected costs or significant delays or abandonment of some or all of these redevelopment opportunities. For any of the above-described reasons, and others, we may determine to abandon opportunities that we have already begun to explore or with respect to which we have commenced redevelopment efforts and, as a result, we may fail to recover expenses already incurred. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully redevelop and lease any of our identified opportunities or that our overall redevelopment program will be successful. Consequences arising from or in connection with any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.We may not be able to successfully implement our investment strategy.We may not be able to successfully implement our investment strategy. We cannot assure you that our portfolio of properties will expand at all, or if it will expand at any specified rate or to any specified size. As part of our overall growth strategy, we regularly review acquisition, financing and redevelopment opportunities, and we expect to continue to pursue investments that we believe will benefit our financial performance. We cannot assure you that investment opportunities which meet our investment criteria will be available. Pursuing our investment opportunities may result in the issuance of new equity securities of the Company that may initially be dilutive to our net income, and such investments may not perform as we expect or produce the returns that we anticipate (including, without limitation, as a result of tenant bankruptcies, tenant concessions, our inability to collect rents and higher than anticipated operating expenses). Further, we may not be able to successfully integrate investments into our existing portfolio without operating disruptions or unanticipated costs. To the extent that our current sources of liquidity are not sufficient to fund such investments, we will require other sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Additionally, to the extent that we increase the size of our portfolio, we may not be able to adapt our management, administrative, accounting and operational systems, or hire and retain sufficient operational staff to integrate investments into our portfolio or manage any future investments without operating disruptions or unanticipated costs. Moreover, our continued growth will require increased investment in management personnel, professional fees, other personnel, financial and management systems and controls and facilities, which will result in 13 additional operating expenses. Under the circumstances described above, our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects may be materially adversely affected.We are subject to risks inherent in owning and leasing real estate.We are subject to varying degrees of risk generally related to leasing and owning real estate, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to general risks applicable to us, our risks include, among others: our liability as a lessee for long-term lease obligations regardless of our revenues; deterioration in national, regional and local economic and real estate market conditions; potential changes in supply of, or demand for, rental properties similar to ours; competition for tenants and declining rental rates; difficulty in selling or re-leasing properties on favorable terms or at all; impairments in our ability to collect rent or other payments due to us when they are due; increases in interest rates and adverse changes in the availability, cost and terms of financing; uninsured property liability; the impact of present or future environmental legislation and compliance with environmental laws; adverse changes in zoning laws and other regulations; acts of terrorism and war; acts of God; the potential risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time the need to periodically renovate and repair our properties; and physical or weather-related damage to our properties. Certain significant expenditures generally do not change in response to economic or other conditions, including: (i) debt service, (ii) real estate taxes, (iii) environmental remediation costs and (iv) operating and maintenance costs. The combination of variable revenue and relatively fixed expenditures may result, under certain market conditions, in reduced earnings and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.Each of the factors listed above could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. In addition, real estate investments are relatively illiquid, which means that our ability to vary our portfolio of properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be limited.Substantially all of our tenants depend on the same industry for their revenues.We derive substantially all of our revenues from leasing, primarily on a triple-net basis, and financing convenience store and gasoline station properties to tenants in the petroleum marketing industry. Accordingly, our revenues are substantially dependent on the economic success of the petroleum marketing industry, and any factors that adversely affect that industry, such as disruption in the supply of petroleum or a decrease in the demand for conventional motor fuels due to conservation, technological advancements in petroleum-fueled motor vehicles or an increase in the use of alternative fuel and battery-operated vehicles, or other “green technologies,” could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. The success of participants in the petroleum marketing industry depends upon the sale of refined petroleum products at margins in excess of fixed and variable expenses. The petroleum marketing industry is highly competitive and volatile. Petroleum products are commodities, the prices of which depend on numerous factors that affect supply and demand. The prices paid by our tenants and other petroleum marketers for products are affected by global, national and regional factors. A large, rapid increase in wholesale petroleum prices would adversely affect the profitability and cash flows of our tenants if the increased cost of petroleum products could not be passed on to their customers or if automobile consumption of gasoline was to decline significantly. We cannot be certain as to how these factors will affect petroleum product prices or supply in the future, or how in particular they will affect our tenants.Adverse developments in general business, economic or political conditions could have a material adverse effect on us.Adverse developments in general business and economic conditions, including through recession, downturn or otherwise, either in the economy generally or in those regions in which a large portion of our business is conducted, could have a material adverse effect on us and significantly increase certain of the risks we are subject to. Among other effects, adverse economic conditions could depress real estate values, impact our ability to re-lease or sell our properties and have an adverse effect on our tenants’ level of sales and financial performance generally. As our revenues are substantially dependent on the economic success of our tenants, any factors that adversely impact our tenants could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.We are exposed to interest rate risk and there can be no assurances that we will manage or mitigate this risk effectively.We are exposed to interest rate risk, primarily as a result of our Credit Agreement. Borrowings under our Credit Agreement bear interest at a floating rate. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates will increase the amount of interest we must pay under our Credit Agreement. Our interest rate risk may materially change in the future if we increase our borrowings under the Credit Agreement or amend our Credit Agreement or Second Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement, seek other sources of debt or equity capital or refinance our outstanding indebtedness. A significant increase in interest rates could also make it more difficult to find alternative financing on desirable terms. For additional information with respect to interest rate risk, see “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in this Form 10-K.14 Inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Although inflation has not materially impacted our results of operations in the recent past, increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations. During times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, as provided for in our leases, rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation. Likewise, even though our triple-net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation, substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue, which may adversely affect our tenants’ ability to pay rent.Recently enacted U.S. federal tax reform legislation could affect REITs generally, our tenants, the markets in which we operate, the price of our common stock and our results of operations, in ways, both positively and negatively, that are difficult to predict.On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Act”) was enacted. The 2017 Act includes significant changes to corporate and individual tax rates and the calculation of taxes. As a REIT, we are generally not required to pay federal taxes otherwise applicable to regular corporations if we distribute all of our income and comply with the various tax rules governing REITs. Stockholders, however, are generally required to pay taxes on REIT dividends. The 2017 Act changes the way in which dividends paid on our stock are taxed by the holder of that stock and could impact the price of our common stock or how stockholders and potential investors view an investment in REITs. In addition, while certain elements of the 2017 Act do not appear to impact us directly as a REIT, they could impact our tenants and the markets in which we operate in ways, both positive and negative, that are difficult to predict. Prospective stockholders are urged to consult with their tax advisors with respect to the 2017 Act and any other regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and the potential effects thereof on an investment in our common stock.Property taxes on our properties may increase without notice.Each of the properties we own or lease is subject to real property taxes. The leases for certain of the properties that we lease from third-parties obligate us to pay real property taxes with regard to those properties. The real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we acquire or lease in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities. To the extent that our tenants are unable or unwilling to pay such increase in accordance with their leases, our net operating expenses may increase.We are defending pending lawsuits and claims and are subject to material losses.We are subject to various lawsuits and claims, including litigation related to environmental matters, such as those arising from leaking USTs, contamination of groundwater with methyl tertiary butyl ether (a fuel derived from methanol, commonly referred to as “MTBE”) and releases of motor fuel into the environment, and toxic tort claims. The ultimate resolution of certain matters cannot be predicted because considerable uncertainty exists both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimate of such loss. Our ultimate liabilities resulting from the lawsuits and claims we face could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. For additional information with respect to certain pending lawsuits and claims, see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” and Note 3 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K.A significant portion of our properties are concentrated in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, and adverse conditions in those regions, in particular, could negatively impact our operations.A significant portion of the properties we own and lease are located in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States and, as of December 31, 2017, 50.2% of our properties are concentrated in three states (New York, Massachusetts and Connecticut). Because of the concentration of our properties in those regions, in the event of adverse economic conditions in those regions, we would likely experience higher risk of default on payment of rent to us than if our properties were more geographically diversified. Additionally, the rents on our properties may be subject to a greater risk of default than other properties in the event of adverse economic, political or business developments, natural disasters or severe weather that may affect the Northeast or Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States and the ability of our lessees to make rent payments. This lack of geographical diversification could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.We are in a competitive business.The real estate industry is highly competitive. Where we own properties, we compete for tenants with a large number of real estate property owners and other companies that sublet properties. Our principal means of competition are rents we are able to charge in relation to the income producing potential of the location. In addition, we expect other major real estate investors, some with much greater financial resources or more experienced personnel than we have, will compete with us for attractive acquisition opportunities. These competitors include petroleum manufacturing, distributing and marketing companies, convenience store retailers, other REITs, 15 public and private investment funds, and other individual and institutional investors. This competition has increased prices for properties we seek to acquire and may impair our ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms in the future.We are subject to losses that may not be covered by insurance.We, and certain of our tenants, carry insurance against certain risks and in such amounts as we believe are customary for businesses of our kind. However, as the costs and availability of insurance change, we may decide not to be covered against certain losses (such as certain environmental liabilities, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and civil disorder) where, in the judgment of management, the insurance is not warranted due to cost or availability of coverage or the remoteness of perceived risk. Furthermore, there are certain types of losses, such as losses resulting from wars, terrorism or certain acts of God, that generally are not insured because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. There is no assurance that the existing insurance coverages are or will be sufficient to cover actual losses incurred. The destruction of, or significant damage to, or significant liabilities arising out of conditions at, our properties due to an uninsured loss would result in an economic loss and could result in us losing both our investment in, and anticipated profits from, such properties. When a loss is insured, the coverage may be insufficient in amount or duration, or a lessee’s customers may be lost, such that the lessee cannot resume its business after the loss at prior levels or at all, resulting in reduced rent or a default under its lease. Any such loss relating to a large number of properties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.Failure to qualify as a REIT under the federal income tax laws would have adverse consequences to our shareholders. Uncertain tax matters may have a significant impact on the results of operations for any single fiscal year or interim period or may cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT.We elected to be treated as a REIT under the federal income tax laws beginning January 1, 2001. To qualify for taxation as a REIT, we must, among other requirements such as those related to the composition of our assets and gross income, distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income, including taxable income that is accrued by us without a corresponding receipt of cash. Accordingly, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on qualifying REIT income, provided that distributions to our shareholders equal at least the amount of our taxable income as defined under the Internal Revenue Code. Many of the REIT requirements are highly technical and complex. If we were to fail to meet the requirements, we may be subject to federal income tax, excise taxes, penalties and interest or we may have to pay a deficiency dividend. We may have to borrow money or sell assets to pay such a deficiency dividend.We cannot guarantee that we will continue to qualify in the future as a REIT. We cannot give any assurance that new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the requirements relating to our qualification. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing our taxable income and will again be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates, we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax, we could be required to pay significant income taxes and we would have less money available for our operations and distributions to shareholders. This would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities. We could also be precluded from treatment as a REIT for four taxable years following the year in which we lost the qualification, and all distributions to shareholders would be taxable as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Loss of our REIT status could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.Future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our equity securities.Our future growth depends upon our ability to raise additional capital. If we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities, such issuance, the receipt of the net proceeds thereof and the use of such proceeds may have a dilutive effect on our expected earnings per share, funds from operations per share and adjusted funds from operations per share. The actual amount of such dilution cannot be determined at this time and will be based on numerous factors. Additionally, we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or preferred stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities in the future. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market after an offering or the perception that such sales could occur.We may change our dividend policy and the dividends we pay may be subject to significant volatility.The decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon such factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant and the dividend paid may vary from expected amounts. Any change in our dividend policy could adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock. In addition, each of the Credit Agreement and the Second Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement prohibit the payments of dividends during certain events of default. No assurance can be given that our financial performance in the future will permit our payment of any dividends or that the amount of dividends we pay, if any, 16 will not fluctuate significantly. Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, our ability to pay dividends would be restricted if, after payment of the dividend, (i) we would not be able to pay indebtedness as it becomes due in the usual course of business or (ii) our total assets would be less than the sum of our liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if we were to be dissolved, to satisfy the rights of any shareholders with liquidation preferences. There currently are no shareholders with liquidation preferences. No assurance can be given that our financial performance in the future will permit our payment of any dividends. Each of the Credit Agreement and the Second Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement contain customary financial covenants such as availability, leverage and coverage ratios and minimum tangible net worth, as well as limitations on restricted payments, which may limit our ability to incur additional debt or pay dividends. As a result of the factors described above, we may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis, which could materially and adversely affect our business, stock price and ability to pay dividends.Changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded common stock.As with other publicly traded securities, the market price of our publicly traded common stock depends on various market conditions, which may change from time-to-time. Among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded common stock are the following: our financial condition and performance and that of our significant tenants; the market’s perception of our growth potential and potential future earnings; the reputation of REITs generally and the reputation of REITs with portfolios similar to us; the attractiveness of the securities of REITs in comparison to securities issued by other entities (including securities issued by other real estate companies); an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for publicly traded securities; the extent of institutional investor interest in us; and general economic and financial market conditions.In order to preserve our REIT status, our charter limits the number of shares a person may own, which may discourage a takeover that could result in a premium price for our common stock or otherwise benefit our stockholders.Our charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our Board of Directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Unless exempted by our Board of Directors, no person may (i) own, or be deemed to own by virtue of certain constructive ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, in excess of 5.0% (in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our common stock or (ii) own, or be deemed to own by virtue of certain other constructive ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, in excess of 9.9% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding shares of our common stock, which may inhibit large investors from desiring to purchase our stock. This restriction may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all of our assets) that might provide a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders.Maryland law may discourage a third-party from acquiring us.We are subject to the provisions of the Maryland Business Combination Act (the “Business Combination Act”) which prohibits transactions between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Generally, pursuant to the Business Combination Act, an “interested stockholder” is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of a Maryland corporation’s voting stock. These provisions could have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of our Company or reducing the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our capital stock. Additionally, the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act may deny voting rights to shares involved in an acquisition of one-tenth or more of the voting stock of a Maryland corporation. In our charter and bylaws, we have elected not to have the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act apply to any acquisition by any person of shares of stock of our Company. However, in the case of the control share acquisition statute, our Board of Directors may opt to make this statute applicable to us at any time by amending our bylaws, and may do so on a retroactive basis. Finally, the “unsolicited takeovers” provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law permit our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to implement certain provisions that may have the effect of inhibiting a third-party from making an acquisition proposal for our Company or of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our Company under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price or that stockholders may otherwise believe is in their best interests.The loss of certain members of our management team could adversely affect our business.Our future success and ability to implement our business and investment strategy depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key management personnel and on the continued contributions of members of our senior management team, each of whom may be difficult to replace. As a REIT, we employ only 30 employees and have a cost-effective management structure. We do not have any employment agreements with any of our executives. In the event of the loss of key management personnel, or upon unexpected death, 17 disability or retirement, we may not be able to find replacements with comparable skill, ability and industry expertise which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.Amendments to the Accounting Standards Codification made by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) or changes in accounting standards issued by other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability or financial position.Our consolidated financial statements are subject to the application of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification, which is periodically amended by the FASB. The application of GAAP is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, we are required to adopt amendments to the Accounting Standards Codification or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time-to-time by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB and the SEC. Those changes could adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability or financial position.Our assets may be subject to impairment charges.We periodically evaluate our real estate investments and other assets for impairment indicators. The judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on GAAP, and includes a variety of factors such as market conditions, the accumulation of asset retirement costs due to changes in estimates associated with our estimated environmental liabilities, the status of significant leases, the financial condition of major tenants and other assumptions and factors that could affect the cash flow from or fair value of our properties. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we incurred $9.3 million and $12.8 million, respectively, of impairment charges. We may be required to take similar impairment charges, which could affect the implementation of our current business strategy and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the market on which our common stock trades, the markets in which we operate, our operations and our results of operations.Terrorist attacks or other acts of violence or war could affect our business or the businesses of our tenants. The consequences of armed conflicts are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. More generally, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States and worldwide financial markets and economy. Terrorist attacks also could be a factor resulting in, or a continuation of, an economic recession in the United States or abroad. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.We rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business.We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, including financial transactions and maintenance of records, which may include personal identifying information of tenants and lease data. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting and storing confidential tenant information, such as individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts. Although we have taken steps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems, it is possible that our security measures will not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning, or the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyberattacks. Security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect us"
2,GTY,GETTY REALTY CORP,2017-03-02,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
 We are subject to various risks, many of which are beyond our control. As a result of these and other factors, we mayexperience material fluctuations in our future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stockprice. An investment in our stock involves various risks, including those mentioned below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and those that are described from time to time in our other filings with the SEC.   7 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsWe incur significant operating costs as a result of environmental laws and regulations which costs couldsignificantly rise and reduce our profitability.  We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws andregulations, including matters relating to the protection of the environment. Under certain environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge ofhazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at, on, or under, such property, and may be required to investigate and clean-up such contamination. Such laws typically impose liability and clean-up responsibility without regard to whether theowner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants, or the timing or cause of the contamination, and the liability under such laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonablebasis for allocation of responsibility. For example, liability may arise as a result of the historical use of a property or from the migration of contamination from adjacent or nearby properties. Any such contamination or liability may also reducethe value of the property. In addition, the owner or operator of a property may be subject to claims by third-parties based on injury, damage and/or costs, including investigation and clean-up costs, resulting from environmental contaminationpresent at or emanating from a property. The properties owned or controlled by us are leased primarily as convenience store and gasoline station properties, and therefore may contain, or may have contained, USTs for the storage of petroleum productsand other hazardous or toxic substances, which creates a potential for the release of such products or substances. Some of our properties are subject to regulations regarding the retirement and decommissioning or removal of long-lived assetsincluding buildings containing hazardous materials, USTs and other equipment. Some of the properties may be adjacent to or near properties that have contained or currently contain USTs used to store petroleum products or other hazardous or toxicsubstances. In addition, certain of the properties are on, adjacent to, or near properties upon which others have engaged or may in the future engage in activities that may release petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. There maybe other environmental problems associated with our properties of which we are unaware. These problems may make it more difficult for us to re-let or sell our properties on favorable terms, or at all. For additional information with respect to pending environmental lawsuits and claims, and environmental remediation obligationsand estimates see Item 3. Legal Proceedings, Environmental Matters in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Notes 3 and 5 inItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Form 10-K.  We enter into leases and variousother agreements which contractually allocate responsibility between the parties for known and unknown environmental liabilities at or relating to the subject properties. We are contingently liable for these environmental obligations in the eventthat our counterparty to the lease or other agreement does not satisfy them. It is possible that our assumptions regarding the ultimate allocation method and share of responsibility that we used to allocate environmental liabilities may change,which may result in material adjustments to the amounts recorded for environmental litigation accruals and environmental remediation liabilities. We are required to accrue for environmental liabilities that we believe are allocable to others underour leases and other agreements if we determine that it is probable that our counterparty will not meet its environmental obligations. We may ultimately be responsible to pay for environmental liabilities as the property owner if the counterpartyfails to pay them. We assess whether to accrue for environmental liabilities based upon relevant factors including our tenants histories of paying for such obligations, our assessment of their financial ability, and their intent to pay forsuch obligations. However, there can be no assurance that our assessments are correct or that our tenants who have paid their obligations in the past will continue to do so. The ultimate resolution of these matters could cause a material adverseeffect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. For all of our triple-net leases, our tenants are contractually responsible for compliance with environmental laws andregulations, removal of USTs at the end of their lease term (the cost of which in certain cases is partially borne by us) and remediation of any environmental contamination that arises during the term of their tenancy. Under the terms of our leasescovering properties previously leased to Marketing (substantially all of which commenced in 2012), we have agreed to be responsible for environmental contamination at the premises that was known at the time the lease commenced, and which existedprior to commencement of the lease and is discovered (other than as a result of a voluntary site investigation) during the first ten years of the lease term (or a shorter period for a minority of such leases). After expiration of such ten-year (or,in certain cases, shorter) period, responsibility for all newly discovered contamination, even if it relates to periods prior to commencement of the lease, is contractually allocated to our tenant. Our tenants at properties previously leased toMarketing are in all cases responsible for the cost of any remediation of contamination that results from their use and occupancy of our properties. Under substantially all of our other triple-net leases, responsibility for remediation of allenvironmental contamination discovered during the term of the lease (including known and unknown contamination that existed prior to commencement of the lease) is the responsibility of our tenant. We anticipate that a majority of the USTs at properties previously leased to Marketing will be replaced over the next severalyears because these USTs are either at or near the end of their useful lives. For long-term, triple-net leases covering sites previously leased to Marketing, our tenants are responsible for the cost of removal and replacement of USTs and forremediation of contamination found during such UST removal and replacement, unless such contamination was found during the first ten years of the lease term and also existed prior to commencement of the lease. In those cases, we are responsible forcosts associated with the remediation of   8 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementssuch contamination. We have also agreed to be responsible for environmental contamination that existed prior to the sale of certain properties assuming the contamination is discovered (other thanas a result of a voluntary site investigation) during the first five years after the sale of the properties.  In the courseof certain UST removals and replacements at properties previously leased to Marketing where we retained continuing responsibility for preexisting environmental obligations, previously unknown environmental contamination was and continues to bediscovered. As a result, we have developed a reasonable estimate of fair value for the prospective future environmental liability resulting from preexisting unknown environmental contamination and accrued for these estimated costs. These estimatesare based primarily upon quantifiable trends, which we believe allow us to make reasonable estimates of fair value for the future costs of environmental remediation resulting from the removal and replacement of USTs. Our accrual of the additionalliability represents the best estimate of the fair value of cost for each component of the liability, net of estimated recoveries from state UST remediation funds, considering estimated recovery rates developed from prior experience with the funds.In arriving at our accrual, we analyzed the ages of USTs at properties where we would be responsible for preexisting contamination found within ten years after commencement of a lease (for properties subject to long-term triple-net leases) or fiveyears from a sale (for divested properties), and projected a cost to closure for new environmental contamination. Based on these estimates, along with relevant economic and risk factors, at December 31, 2016 and 2015, we have accrued $45.0million and $45.4 million, respectively, for these future environmental liabilities related to preexisting unknown contamination. Our estimates are based upon facts that are known to us at this time and an assessment of the possible ultimateremedial action outcomes. It is possible that our assumptions, which form the basis of our estimates, regarding our ultimate environmental liabilities may change, which may result in our providing an accrual, or adjustments to the amounts recorded,for environmental remediation liabilities. Among the many uncertainties that impact the estimates are our assumptions, the necessary regulatory approvals for, and potential modifications of remediation plans, the amount of data available uponinitial assessment of contamination, changes in costs associated with environmental remediation services and equipment, the availability of state UST remediation funds and the possibility of existing legal claims giving rise to additional claims.Additional environmental liabilities could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. Environmental exposures are difficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons, including the extent of contamination,alternative treatment methods that may be applied, location of the property which subjects it to differing local laws and regulations and their interpretations, as well as the time it takes to remediate contamination and receive regulatory approval.In developing our liability for estimated environmental remediation obligations on a property by property basis, we consider among other things, enacted laws and regulations, assessments of contamination and surrounding geology, quality ofinformation available, currently available technologies for treatment, alternative methods of remediation and prior experience. Environmental accruals are based on estimates which are subject to significant change, and are adjusted as theremediation treatment progresses, as circumstances change and as environmental contingencies become more clearly defined and reasonably estimable. We expect to adjust the accrued liabilities for environmental remediation obligations reflected in ourconsolidated financial statements as they become probable and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.  We measureour environmental remediation liability at fair value based on expected future net cash flows, adjusted for inflation, and then discount them to present value. We adjust our environmental remediation liability quarterly to reflect changes inprojected expenditures, changes in present value due to the passage of time and reductions in estimated liabilities as a result of actual expenditures incurred during each quarter. As of December 31, 2016, we had accrued a total of $74.5million for our prospective environmental remediation liability. This accrual includes (a) $29.5 million, which was our best estimate of reasonably estimable environmental remediation obligations and obligations to remove USTs for which we arethe title owner, net of estimated recoveries and (b) $45.0 million for future environmental liabilities related to preexisting unknown contamination. We cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations may be enacted in the future, or how existing laws orregulations will be administered or interpreted with respect to products or activities to which they have not previously been applied. We cannot predict if state UST fund programs will be administered and funded in the future in a manner that isconsistent with past practices and if future environmental spending will continue to be eligible for reimbursement at historical recovery rates under these programs. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorousenforcement policies of the regulatory agencies or stricter interpretation of existing laws, which may develop in the future, could have an adverse effect on our financial position, or that of our tenants, and could require substantial additionalexpenditures for future remediation.  As a result of the factors discussed above, or others, compliance with environmentallaws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. We are exposed to counterparty risk and there can be no assurances that we will effectively manage or mitigate this risk. We regularly interact with counterparties in various industries. The types of counterparties most common to our transactionsand agreements include, but are not limited to, landlords, tenants, vendors and lenders. We also enter into agreements to acquire and sell properties which allocate responsibility for certain costs to the counterparty. Our most significantcounterparties include, but are not   9 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementslimited to, the members of the Bank Syndicate related to our Credit Agreement, the lender that is the counterparty to the Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement and our major tenants fromwhom we derive a significant amount of rental revenue. The default, insolvency or other inability or unwillingness of a significant counterparty to perform its obligations under an agreement or transaction, including, without limitation, as a resultof the rejection of an agreement or transaction in bankruptcy proceedings, is likely to have a material adverse effect on us. As of December 31, 2016, we leased 166 convenience store and gasoline station properties pursuant to three separateunitary leases and three stand-alone leases to subsidiaries of Global Partners, LP (NYSE: GLP) (Global Partners). Two of these leases were assigned to subsidiaries of Global Partners in June 2015 by our former tenants, White OakPetroleum, LLC and Big Apple Petroleum Realty, LLC (both affiliates of Capitol Petroleum Group, LLC). In the aggregate, our leases with subsidiaries of Global Partners represented 21% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016and 2015. All of our unitary leases with subsidiaries of Global Partners are guaranteed by the parent company. As of December 31, 2016, we leased 77 convenience store and gasoline station properties pursuant to three separate unitary leases toApro, LLC (d/b/a United Oil). In the aggregate, our leases with United Oil represented 15% and 9% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See Item 9B in this Form 10-K for selectedcombined audited financial data of United Oil. As of December 31, 2016, we leased 79 convenience store and gasoline station properties pursuant to three separate unitary leases to subsidiaries of Chestnut Petroleum Dist. Inc. (ChestnutPetroleum). In the aggregate, our leases with subsidiaries of Chestnut Petroleum represented 15% and 16% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The largest of these unitary leases, covering 57of our properties, is guaranteed by the parent company, its principals and numerous Chestnut Petroleum affiliates. We may also undertake additional transactions with these or other existing tenants which would further concentrate our sources ofrental revenues. Many of our tenants, including those noted above, are part of larger corporate organizations and the financial distress of one subsidiary or other affiliated companies or businesses in those organizations may negatively impact theability or willingness of our tenant to perform its obligations under its lease with us. The failure of a major tenant or their default in their rental and other obligations to us is likely to have a material adverse effect on our business,financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.  Because certain of our tenants are not rated andtheir financial information is not available to you, it may be difficult for our investors to determine their creditworthiness. The majority of our properties are leased to tenants who are not rated by any nationally recognized statistical ratingorganizations. In addition, our tenants financial information is not generally available to our investors. Additionally, many of our tenants are part of larger corporate organizations and we do not receive financial information for the otherentities in those organizations. The financial distress of other affiliated companies or businesses in those organizations may negatively impact the ability or willingness of our tenant to perform its obligations under its lease with us. Because ofthe lack of financial information or credit ratings it is, therefore, difficult for our investors to assess the creditworthiness of our tenants and to determine the ability of a tenant to meet its obligations to us. It is possible that theassumptions and estimates we make after reviewing publicly and privately obtained information about our tenants are not accurate and that we may be required to increase reserves for bad debts, record allowances for deferred rent receivable or recordadditional expenses if our tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations to us.  Our future cash flow is dependent on the performance ofour tenants of their lease obligations, renewal of existing leases and either re-leasing or selling our properties. We are subject to risks that financial distress, default or bankruptcy of our tenants may lead to vacancy at our properties ordisruption in rent receipts as a result of partial payment or nonpayment of rent or that expiring leases may not be renewed. Under unfavorable general economic conditions, there can be no assurance that our tenants level of sales and financialperformance generally will not be adversely affected, which in turn, could negatively impact our rental revenues. We are subject to risks that the terms governing renewal or re-leasing of our properties (including, compliance with numerous federal,state and local laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment, such as the remediation of contamination and the retirement and decommissioning or removal of long-lived assets, the cost of required renovations, or replacement ofUSTs and related equipment) may be less favorable than current lease terms.  We are also subject to the risk that we mayreceive less net proceeds from the properties we sell as compared to their current carrying value or that the value of our properties may be adversely affected by unfavorable general economic conditions. Unfavorable general economic conditions mayalso negatively impact our ability to re-lease or sell our properties. Numerous properties compete with our properties in attracting tenants to lease space. The number of available or competitive properties in a particular area could have a materialadverse effect on our ability to lease or sell our properties and on the rents we are able to charge. In addition to the risk of disruption in rent receipts, we are subject to the risk of incurring real estate taxes, maintenance, environmental andother expenses at vacant properties. The financial distress, default or bankruptcy of our tenants may also lead to protracted and expensive processes for retaking control of our properties than would otherwise be the case, including, eviction orother legal proceedings related to or resulting from the tenants default. These risks are greater with respect to certain of our tenants who lease multiple properties from us.   10 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsIf a tenant files for bankruptcy protection it is possible that we would recover substantially less than the full value of our claims against the tenant. If our tenants do not perform their leaseobligations; or we are unable to renew existing leases and promptly recapture and re-lease or sell our properties; or if lease terms upon renewal or re-leasing are less favorable than current or historical lease terms; or if the values of propertiesthat we sell are adversely affected by market conditions; or if we incur significant costs or disruption related to or resulting from tenant financial distress, default or bankruptcy; then our cash flow could be significantly adversely affected. We are dependent on external sources of capital which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. We are dependent on external sources of capital to maintain our status as a REIT and must distribute to our shareholders eachyear at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding any net capital gain. Because of these distribution requirements, it is not likely that we will be able to fund all future capital needs, including acquisitions, from income from operations.Therefore, we will have to continue to rely on third-party sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. We may need to access the capital markets in order to execute future significant acquisitions. There canbe no assurance that sources of capital will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.  Our principal sources ofliquidity are our cash flows from operations, funds available under our $225.0 million Credit Agreement with a group of banks led by Bank of America, N.A. The Credit Agreement consists of a $175.0 million Revolving Facility, which is scheduled tomature in June 2018 and a $50.0 million Term Loan, which is scheduled to mature in June 2020. Subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement and our continued compliance with its provisions, we have the option to (a) extend the term of theRevolving Facility for one additional year to June 2019 and (b) increase by $75.0 million the amount of the Revolving Facility to $250.0 million. On June 2, 2015, we entered into the Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement, amendingand restating our existing senior secured note purchase agreement with Prudential and an affiliate of Prudential. Pursuant to the Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement, among other matters, Prudential and its affiliate, redenominated theexisting notes in the aggregate amount of $100.0 million issued under the existing note purchase agreement as senior unsecured Series A Notes, and issued $75.0 million of senior unsecured Series B Notes bearing interest at 5.35% andmaturing in June 2023 to Prudential and certain affiliates of Prudential. The Series A Notes continue to bear interest at 6.0% and mature in February 2021. For additional information, please refer to Credit Agreement andSenior Unsecured Notes in Note 4 in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Form 10-K. Each of the Credit Agreement and the Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement contains customary financial and othercovenants such as leverage and coverage ratios and minimum tangible net worth, as well as limitations on restricted payments, which may limit our ability to incur additional debt or pay dividends. The Credit Agreement contains customary events ofdefault, including default under the Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement, change of control and failure to maintain REIT status. The Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement contains customary events of default, including default underthe Credit Agreement and failure to maintain REIT status. Our ability to meet the terms of the agreements is dependent on our continued ability to meet certain criteria as further described in Note 4 in Item 8. Financial Statementsand Supplementary Data the performance of our tenants and the other risks described in this section. If we are not in compliance with one or more of our covenants, which could result in an event of default under our Credit Agreement or ourRestated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement, there can be no assurance that our lenders would waive such non-compliance. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation, liquidity, ability to paydividends or stock price.  Our access to third-party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors including generalmarket conditions, the markets perception of our growth potential, financial stability, our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions, covenants and limitations imposed under our Credit Agreement and Restated Prudential NotePurchase Agreement and the market price of our common stock.  Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report ourfinancial position and results of operations, and they require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial position and results ofoperations. We have identified several accounting policies as being critical to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations because they require management to make particularly subjective or complex judgments about mattersthat are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be recorded under different conditions or using different assumptions. We cannot provide any assurance that we will not make subsequent significantadjustments to our consolidated financial statements. Estimates, judgments and assumptions underlying our consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, receivables and related reserves, deferred rent receivable, income underdirect financing leases, asset retirement obligations including environmental remediation obligations and future environmental liabilities for pre-existing unknown environmental contamination, real estate, depreciation and amortization, carryingvalue of our properties, impairment of long-lived assets, litigation,   11 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsaccrued liabilities, income taxes and allocation of the purchase price of properties acquired to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If our accounting policies, methods, judgments, assumptions, estimates and allocations prove to be incorrect, or ifcircumstances change, our business, financial condition, revenues, operating expense, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price may be materially adversely affected. Our business operations may not generate sufficient cash for distributions or debt service. There is no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will beavailable to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay dividends on our common stock, to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may not be able to repay or refinance existing indebtedness on favorable terms, which couldforce us to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms (which may also result in losses) or accept financing on unfavorable terms.  We mayacquire new properties and this may create risks.  We may acquire or develop properties when we believe that anacquisition or development matches our business and investment strategies. These properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential. It is possible that the operating performanceof these properties may decline after we acquire them, they may not perform as expected and, if financed by the Company using debt or new equity issuances, may result in shareholder dilution. Our acquisition of properties will expose us to theliabilities of those properties, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition. We face competition in pursuing these acquisitions and we may not succeed in leasing acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover their costs ofacquisition and operations.  Newly acquired properties may require significant management attention that would otherwise bedevoted to our ongoing business. We may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions. Consequences arising from or in connection with any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results ofoperations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.  We are pursuing redevelopment opportunities and this creates risks to our Company. We have commenced a program to redevelop certain of our properties and to recapture select properties from our netlease portfolio in order to redevelop such properties for alternative uses. The success at each stage of our redevelopment program is dependent on numerous factors and risks including our ability to identify and extract preferred sites from ourportfolio and successfully prepare and market them for alternative uses, and project development issues, including those relating to planning, zoning, licensing, permitting, third party and governmental authorizations, changes in local marketconditions, increases in construction costs, the availability and cost of financing, and issues arising from possible discovery of new environmental contamination and the need to conduct environmental remediation. Occupancy rates and rents at anyparticular redeveloped property may fail to meet our original expectations for a number of reasons beyond our control, including changes in market and economic conditions and the development by competitors of competing properties. We couldexperience increased and unexpected costs or significant delays or abandonment of some or all of these redevelopment opportunities. For any of the above-described reasons, and others, we may determine to abandon opportunities that we have alreadybegun to explore or with respect to which we have commenced redevelopment efforts and, as a result, we may fail to recover expenses already incurred. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully redevelop and lease any of our identifiedopportunities or that our overall redevelopment program will be successful. Consequences arising from or in connection with any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations,liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.  We may not be able to successfully implement our investment strategy. We may not be able to successfully implement our investment strategy. We cannot assure you that our portfolio of propertieswill expand at all, or if it will expand at any specified rate or to any specified size. As part of our overall growth strategy, we regularly review acquisition, financing and development opportunities, and we expect to continue to pursueinvestments that we believe will benefit our financial performance. We cannot assure you that investment opportunities will be available which meet our investment criteria. Pursuing our investment opportunities may result in the issuance of newequity securities of the Company that may initially be dilutive to our net income, and such investments may not perform as we expect or produce the returns that we anticipate (including, without limitation, as a result of tenant bankruptcies, tenantconcessions, our inability to collect rents and higher than anticipated operating expenses). Further, we may not successfully integrate investments into our existing portfolio without operating disruptions or unanticipated costs. To the extent thatour current sources of liquidity are not sufficient to fund such investments, we will require other sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Additionally, to the extent we increase the size of ourportfolio, we may not be able to adapt our management, administrative, accounting and   12 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsoperational systems, or hire and retain sufficient operational staff to integrate investments into our portfolio or manage any future investments without operating disruptions or unanticipatedcosts. Moreover, our continued growth will require increased investment in management personnel, professional fees, other personnel, financial and management systems and controls and facilities, which will result in additional operating expenses.Under the circumstances described above, our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects may be materially adversely affected. We are subject to risks inherent in owning and leasing real estate. We are subject to varying degrees of risk generally related to leasing and owning real estate many of which are beyond ourcontrol. In addition to general risks applicable to us, our risks include, among others: our liability as a lessee for long-term lease obligations regardless of our revenues; deterioration in national, regional and local economic and real estatemarket conditions; potential changes in supply of, or demand for, rental properties similar to ours; competition for tenants and declining rental rates; difficulty in selling or re-leasing properties on favorable terms or at all; impairments in ourability to collect rent or other payments due to us when they are due; increases in interest rates and adverse changes in the availability, cost and terms of financing; uninsured property liability; the impact of present or future environmentallegislation and compliance with environmental laws; adverse changes in zoning laws and other regulations; acts of terrorism and war; acts of God; the potential risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time the need to periodically renovateand repair our properties; and physical or weather-related damage to our properties.  Certain significant expendituresgenerally do not change in response to economic or other conditions, including: (i) debt service, (ii) real estate taxes, (iii) environmental remediation costs and (iv) operating and maintenance costs. The combination of variablerevenue and relatively fixed expenditures may result, under certain market conditions, in reduced earnings and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. Each of the factors listed above could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results ofoperations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. In addition, real estate investments are relatively illiquid, which means that our ability to vary our portfolio of properties in response to changes in economic and other conditionsmay be limited.  Adverse developments in general business, economic or political conditions could have a material adverse effect on us. Adverse developments in general business and economic conditions, including through recession, downturn or otherwise, either inthe economy generally or in those regions in which a large portion of our business is conducted, could have a material adverse effect on us and significantly increase certain of the risks we are subject to. Among other effects, adverse economicconditions could depress real estate values, impact our ability to re-let or sell our properties and have an adverse effect on our tenants level of sales and financial performance generally. Our revenues are dependent on the economic successof our tenants and any factors that adversely impact our tenants could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. Substantially all of our tenants depend on the same industry for their revenues. We derive substantially all of our revenues from leasing, primarily on a triple-net basis, and financing convenience store andgasoline station properties to tenants in the petroleum marketing industry. Accordingly, our revenues are substantially dependent on the economic success of the petroleum marketing industry, and any factors that adversely affect that industry, suchas disruption in the supply of petroleum or a decrease in the demand for conventional motor fuels due to conservation, technological advancements in petroleum-fueled motor vehicles or an increase in the use of alternative fuel vehicles, orgreen technology could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. The success of participants in the petroleum marketing industrydepends upon the sale of refined petroleum products at margins in excess of fixed and variable expenses. The petroleum marketing industry is highly competitive and volatile. Petroleum products are commodities, the prices of which depend on numerousfactors that affect supply and demand. The prices paid by our tenants and other petroleum marketers for products are affected by global, national and regional factors. A large, rapid increase in wholesale petroleum prices would adversely affect theprofitability and cash flows of our tenants if the increased cost of petroleum products could not be passed on to their customers or if automobile consumption of gasoline was to decline significantly. We cannot be certain how these factors willaffect petroleum product prices or supply in the future, or how in particular they will affect our tenants.  Property taxes on our properties mayincrease without notice.  Each of the properties we own or lease is subject to real property taxes. The leases forcertain of the properties that we lease from third-parties obligate us to pay real property taxes with regard to those properties. The real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we acquire or lease in the future may increaseas property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities. To the extent that our tenants are not responsible for property taxes pursuant to their   13 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementscontractual arrangements with us or are unable or unwilling to pay such increase in accordance with their leases, our net operating expenses may increase. We are defending pending lawsuits and claims and are subject to material losses. We are subject to various lawsuits and claims, including litigation related to environmental matters, such as those arisingfrom leaking USTs, contamination of groundwater with methyl tertiary butyl ether (a fuel derived from methanol, commonly referred to as MTBE) and releases of motor fuel into the environment, and toxic tort claims. For example, we arecurrently involved in several proceedings described in Item 3. Legal Proceedings in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The ultimate resolution of certain matters cannot be predicted because considerable uncertainty exists both interms of the probability of loss and the estimate of such loss. Our ultimate liabilities resulting from the lawsuits and claims we face could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity,ability to pay dividends or stock price. For additional information with respect to pending environmental lawsuits and claims and environmental remediation obligations and estimates see Item 3. Legal Proceedings, EnvironmentalMatters in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Notes 3 and 5 in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Form 10-K. A significant portion of our properties are concentrated in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, andadverse conditions in those regions, in particular, could negatively impact our operations.  A significant portionof the properties we own and lease are located in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States and 56.5% of our properties are concentrated in three states (New York, Massachusetts and Connecticut). Because of the concentration of ourproperties in those regions, in the event of adverse economic conditions in those regions, we would likely experience higher risk of default on payment of rent to us than if our properties were more geographically diversified. Additionally, therents on our properties may be subject to a greater risk of default than other properties in the event of adverse economic, political or business developments or natural hazards that may affect the Northeast or Mid-Atlantic regions of the UnitedStates and the ability of our lessees to make rent payments. This lack of geographical diversification could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stockprice.  We are in a competitive business. The real estate industry is highly competitive. Where we own properties, we compete for tenants with a large number of realestate property owners and other companies that sublet properties. Our principal means of competition are rents we are able to charge in relation to the income producing potential of the location. In addition, we expect other major real estateinvestors, some with much greater financial resources or more experienced personnel than we have, will compete with us for attractive acquisition opportunities. These competitors include petroleum manufacturing, distributing and marketing companies,convenience store retailers, other REITs, public and private investment funds, and other individual and institutional investors. This competition has increased prices for properties we seek to acquire and may impair our ability to make suitableproperty acquisitions on favorable terms in the future.  We are subject to losses that may not be covered by insurance. We, and certain of our tenants, carry insurance against certain risks and in such amounts as we believe are customary forbusinesses of our kind. However, as the costs and availability of insurance change, we may decide not to be covered against certain losses (such as certain environmental liabilities, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and civil disorder) where, in thejudgment of management, the insurance is not warranted due to cost or availability of coverage or the remoteness of perceived risk. Furthermore, there are certain types of losses, such as losses resulting from wars, terrorism or certain acts of God,that generally are not insured because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. There is no assurance that the existing insurance coverages are or will be sufficient to cover actual losses incurred. The destruction of, orsignificant damage to, or significant liabilities arising out of conditions at, our properties due to an uninsured loss would result in an economic loss and could result in us losing both our investment in, and anticipated profits from, suchproperties. When a loss is insured, the coverage may be insufficient in amount or duration, or a lessees customers may be lost, such that the lessee cannot resume its business after the loss at prior levels or at all, resulting in reduced rentor a default under its lease. Any such loss relating to a large number of properties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. Failure to qualify as a REIT under the federal income tax laws would have adverse consequences to our shareholders. Uncertain taxmatters may have a significant impact on the results of operations for any single fiscal year or interim period or may cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT. We elected to be treated as a REIT under the federal income tax laws beginning January 1, 2001. To qualify for taxation asa REIT, we must, among other requirements such as those related to the composition of our assets and gross income, distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income, including taxable income that is accrued by us without a  14 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementscorresponding receipt of cash. Accordingly, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on qualifying REIT income, provided that distributions to our shareholders equal at least theamount of our taxable income as defined under the Internal Revenue Code.  Many of the REIT requirements are highlytechnical and complex. If we were to fail to meet the requirements, or if the Internal Revenue Service were to successfully assert that our earnings and profits were greater than the amount distributed, we may be subject to federal income tax,excise taxes, penalties and interest or we may have to pay a deficiency dividend to eliminate any earnings and profits that were not distributed. We may have to borrow money or sell assets to pay such a deficiency dividend. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to qualify in the future as a REIT. We cannot give any assurance that newlegislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the requirements relating to our qualification. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions toshareholders in computing our taxable income and will again be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates, we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax, we could be required to pay significant income taxes and we wouldhave less money available for our operations and distributions to shareholders. This would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities. We could also be precluded from treatment as a REIT for four taxable years followingthe year in which we lost the qualification, and all distributions to shareholders would be taxable as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Loss of our REIT status could have a materialadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.  Weare exposed to interest rate risk and there can be no assurances that we will manage or mitigate this risk effectively. We are exposed to interest rate risk, primarily as a result of our Credit Agreement. Borrowings under our Credit Agreement bearinterest at a floating rate. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates will increase the amount of interest we must pay under our Credit Agreement. Our interest rate risk may materially change in the future if we increase our borrowings under theCredit Agreement, or amend our Credit Agreement or Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement, seek other sources of debt or equity capital or refinance our outstanding debt. A significant increase in interest rates could also make it moredifficult to find alternative financing on desirable terms. For additional information with respect to interest rate risk, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in this Form 10-K. Inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Although inflation has not materially impacted our results of operations in the recent past, increased inflation could have amore pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations. During times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, as provided for in our leases, rent increases may not keep up with therate of inflation. Likewise, even though our triple-net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation, substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in theiroperating expenses exceed increases in revenue, which may adversely affect our tenants ability to pay rent.  Future issuances of equitysecurities could dilute the interest of holders of our equity securities.  Our future growth will depend upon ourability to raise additional capital. If we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities, we could dilute the interest of holders of our common stock. The interest of our common stockholders could also be diluted by theissuance of shares of common stock pursuant to stock incentive plans. Accordingly, the Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of equity securities that could dilute, or otherwise adversely affect, the interest of holders of our common stock. We may change our dividend policy and the dividends we pay may be subject to significant volatility. The decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future, as well as the timing, amount and composition ofany such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on such factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant. In addition, our Credit Agreement and our Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreementprohibit the payments of dividends during certain events of default. No assurance can be given that our financial performance in the future will permit our payment of any dividends or that the amount of dividends we pay, if any, will not fluctuatesignificantly.  Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, our ability to pay dividends would be restricted if, afterpayment of the dividend, (1) we would not be able to pay indebtedness as it becomes due in the usual course of business or (2) our total assets would be less than the sum of our liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if we wereto be dissolved, to satisfy the rights of any shareholders with liquidation preferences. There currently are no shareholders with liquidation preferences.   15 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsChanges in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded common stock. As with other publicly traded securities, the market price of our publicly traded common stock depends on variousmarket conditions, which may change from time-to-time. Among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded common stock are the following: our financial condition and performance and that of our significant tenants;the markets perception of our growth potential and potential future earnings; the reputation of REITs generally and the reputation of REITs with portfolios similar to us; the attractiveness of the securities of REITs in comparison tosecurities issued by other entities (including securities issued by other real estate companies); an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid forpublicly traded securities; the extent of institutional investor interest in us; and general economic and financial market conditions. In order to preserve our REIT status, our charter limits the number of shares a person may own, which may discourage a takeover thatcould result in a premium price for our common stock or otherwise benefit our stockholders.  Our charter, withcertain exceptions, authorizes our Board of Directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Unless exempted by our Board of Directors, no person may actually orconstructively own more than 5% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding shares of our common stock or the outstanding shares of any class or series of our preferred stock, which may inhibit large investorsfrom desiring to purchase our stock. This restriction may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all of ourassets) that might provide a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders.  Maryland law maydiscourage a third-party from acquiring us.  We are subject to the provisions of the Maryland Business CombinationAct (the Business Combination Act) which prohibits transactions between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interestedstockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Generally, pursuant to the Business Combination Act, an interested stockholder is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10% ormore of a Maryland corporations voting stock. These provisions could have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of our Company or reducing the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future forshares of our capital stock. Additionally, the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act may deny voting rights to shares involved in an acquisition of one-tenth or more of the voting stock of a Maryland corporation. In our charter and bylaws, we haveelected not to have the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act apply to any acquisition by any person of shares of stock of our Company. However, in the case of the control share acquisition statute, our Board of Directors may opt to make thisstatute applicable to us at any time by amending our bylaws, and may do so on a retroactive basis. Finally, the unsolicited takeovers provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law permit our Board of Directors, without stockholderapproval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to implement certain provisions that may have the effect of inhibiting a third-party from making an acquisition proposal for our Company or of delaying, deferring orpreventing a change in control of our Company under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price or that stockholders may otherwise believe isin their best interests.  The loss of certain members of our management team could adversely affect our business. Our future success and ability to implement our business and investment strategy depends, in part, on our ability to attractand retain key management personnel and on the continued contributions of members of our senior management team, each of whom would be difficult to replace. As a REIT, we employ only 31 employees and have a cost-effective management structure. We donot have any employment agreements with any of our executives. In the event of the loss of key management personnel, or upon unexpected death, disability or retirement, we may not be able to find replacements with comparable skill, ability andindustry expertise which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. Amendments to the Accounting Standards Codification made by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) or changesin accounting standards issued by other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability or financial position. Our consolidated financial statements are subject to the application of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles(GAAP) in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification, which is periodically amended by the FASB. The application of GAAP is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, we are required to adopt amendments tothe Accounting Standards Codification or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time-to-time by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB and the SEC. Those changes could adversely affect our reported revenues,profitability or financial position.   16 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsOur assets may be subject to impairment charges. We periodically evaluate our real estate investments and other assets for impairment indicators. The judgment regarding theexistence of impairment indicators is based on GAAP, and includes a variety of factors such as market conditions, the accumulation of asset retirement costs due to changes in estimates associated with our estimated environmental liabilities, thestatus of significant leases, the financial condition of major tenants and other assumptions and factors that could affect the cash flow from or fair value of our properties. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we incurred $12.8million and $17.4 million, respectively, of impairment charges. We may be required to take similar impairment charges, which could affect the implementation of our current business strategy and have a material adverse effect on our financialcondition and results of operations.  Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the market on which our commonstock trades, the markets in which we operate, our operations and our results of operations.  Terrorist attacks orother acts of violence or war could affect our business or the businesses of our tenants. The consequences of armed conflicts are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. Moregenerally, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States and worldwide financial markets and economy. Terrorist attacks also could be a factor resulting in, or acontinuation of, an economic recession in the United States or abroad. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. We rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of thattechnology could harm our business.  We rely on information technology networks and systems, including theInternet, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, including financial transactions and maintenance of records, which may include personal identifying information of tenantsand lease data. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting and storing confidential tenant information, such as individually identifiable information relating tofinancial accounts. Although we have taken steps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems, it is possible that our security measures will not be able to prevent the systems improper functioning, or the improperdisclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyberattacks. Security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions,shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims orregulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect us"
12,GTY,GETTY REALTY CORP,2016-03-10,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
 We are subject to various risks, many of which are beyond our control. As a result of these and other factors, we may experience materialfluctuations in our future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. An investment inour stock involves various risks, including those mentioned below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and those that are described from time to time in our other filings with the SEC. We incur significant operating costs as a result of environmental laws and regulations which costs could significantly rise and reduce ourprofitability.  We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, including matters relating to theprotection of the environment. Under certain environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum productsat, on, or under, such property, and may be required to investigate and clean-up such contamination. Such laws typically impose liability and clean-up responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence ofthe contaminants, or the timing or cause of the contamination, and the liability under such laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility. For example,liability may arise as a result of the historical use of a property or from the migration of contamination from adjacent or nearby properties. Any such contamination or liability may also reduce the value of the property. In addition, the owner oroperator of a property may be subject to claims by third-parties based on injury, damage and/or costs, including investigation and clean-up costs, resulting from environmental contamination present at or emanating from a property. The propertiesowned or controlled by us are leased primarily as convenience store and gasoline station properties, and therefore may contain, or may have contained, USTs for the storage of petroleum products and other hazardous or toxic substances, which createsa potential for the release of such products or substances. Some of our properties may be subject to regulations regarding the retirement and decommissioning or removal of long-lived assets including buildings containing hazardous materials, USTsand other equipment. Some of the properties may be adjacent to or near properties that have contained or currently contain USTs used to store petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, certain of the properties are on,adjacent to, or near properties upon which others have engaged or may in the future engage in activities that may release petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. There may be other environmental problems associated with ourproperties of which we are unaware. These problems may make it more difficult for us to re-let or sell our properties on favorable terms, or at all. For additional information with respect to pending environmental lawsuits and claims, and environmental remediation obligations and estimatessee Item 3. Legal Proceedings, Environmental Matters in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Notes 3 and 5 in Item 8. Financial Statementsand Supplementary Data  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We enter into leasesand various other agreements which contractually allocate responsibility between the parties for known and unknown environmental liabilities at or relating to the subject properties. We are contingently liable for these environmental obligations inthe event that our counterparty to the lease or other agreement does not satisfy them. It is possible that our assumptions regarding the ultimate allocation method and share of responsibility that we used to allocate environmental liabilities maychange, which may result in material adjustments to the amounts recorded for environmental litigation accruals and environmental remediation liabilities. We are required to accrue for environmental liabilities that we believe are allocable to othersunder our leases and other agreements if we determine that it is probable that our counterparty will not meet its environmental obligations. We may ultimately be responsible to pay for environmental liabilities as the property owner if thecounterparty fails to pay them. We assess whether to accrue for environmental liabilities based upon relevant factors including our tenants histories of paying for such obligations, our assessment of their financial ability, and their intentto pay for such obligations. However, there can be no assurance that our   9 Table of Contentsassessments or estimates are correct or that our tenants who have paid their obligations in the past will continue to do so. The ultimate resolution of these matters could cause a materialadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.  For allof our triple-net leases, our tenants are contractually responsible for compliance with environmental laws and regulations, removal of USTs at the end of their lease term and remediation of any environmental contamination that arises during the termof their tenancy. Under the terms of our leases covering properties previously leased to Marketing (substantially all of which commenced in 2012), we have agreed to be responsible for environmental contamination at the premises that was known at thetime the lease commenced, and which existed prior to commencement of the lease and is discovered (other than as a result of a voluntary site investigation) during the first ten years of the lease term (or a shorter period for a minority of suchleases). After expiration of such ten year (or, in certain cases, shorter) period, responsibility for all newly discovered contamination, even if it relates to periods prior to commencement of the lease, is contractually allocated to our tenant. Ourtenants at properties previously leased to Marketing are in all cases responsible for the cost of any remediation of contamination that results from their use and occupancy of our properties. Under substantially all of our other triple-net leases,responsibility for remediation of all environmental contamination discovered during the term of the lease (including known and unknown contamination that existed prior to commencement of the lease) is the responsibility of our tenant. We anticipate that a majority of the USTs at properties previously leased to Marketing will be replaced over the next decade because theseUSTs are either at or near the end of their useful lives. For long-term, triple-net leases covering sites previously leased to Marketing, our tenants are responsible for the cost of removal and replacement of USTs and for remediation ofcontamination found during such UST removal and replacement, unless such contamination was found during the first ten years of the lease term and also existed prior to commencement of the lease. In those cases, we are responsible for costsassociated with the remediation of such contamination. For our transitional properties occupied under month-to-month license agreements, or which are vacant, we are responsible for costs associated with UST removals and for the cost of remediationof contamination found during the removal of USTs. We have also agreed to be responsible for environmental contamination that existed prior to the sale of certain properties assuming the contamination is discovered (other than as a result of avoluntary site investigation) during the first five years after the sale of the properties. For additional information regarding our transitional properties, see Item 1. Business  Company Operations and TransitionalProperties in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations which appear in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. After the termination of the Master Lease, we commenced a process to take control of our properties and to reposition them. A substantialportion of these properties had USTs which were either at or near the end of their useful lives. For properties that we sold, we elected to remove certain of these USTs and in the course of re-leasing properties, we made lease concessions toreimburse our tenants at operating gasoline stations for certain capital expenditures including UST replacements. In the course of these UST removals and replacements, previously unknown environmental contamination has been and continues to bediscovered. As a result of these developments, we began to assess our prospective future environmental liability resulting from preexisting unknown environmental contamination which we believe might be discovered during removal and replacement ofUSTs at properties previously leased to Marketing in the future.  We have developed a reasonable estimate of fair value for theprospective future environmental liability resulting from preexisting unknown environmental contamination and accrued for these estimated costs. These estimates are based primarily upon quantifiable trends, which we believe allow us to makereasonable estimates of fair value for the future costs of environmental remediation resulting from the removal and replacement of USTs. Our accrual of the additional liability represents the best estimate of the fair value of cost for eachcomponent of the liability, net of estimated recoveries from state UST remediation funds, considering estimated recovery rates developed from prior experience with the funds. In arriving at our accrual, we analyzed the ages of USTs at propertieswhere we would be responsible for preexisting contamination found within ten years after commencement of a lease (for properties subject to long-term triple-net leases) or five years from a sale (for divested properties), and projected a cost toclosure for new environmental contamination. Based on these estimates, along with relevant economic and risk factors, at December 31, 2015 and 2014, we accrued $45.4 million and $49.7 million, respectively, for these future environmentalliabilities related to preexisting unknown contamination. Our estimates are based upon facts that are known to us at this time and an assessment of the possible ultimate remedial action outcomes. It is possible that our assumptions, which form thebasis of our estimates, regarding our ultimate environmental liabilities may change, which may result in our providing an accrual, or adjustments to the amounts recorded, for environmental remediation liabilities. Among the many uncertainties thatimpact the estimates are our assumptions, the necessary regulatory approvals for, and potential modifications of remediation plans, the amount of data available upon initial assessment of contamination, changes in costs associated with environmentalremediation services and equipment, the availability of state UST remediation funds and the possibility of existing legal claims giving rise to additional claims. Additional environmental liabilities could cause a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.  Environmental exposures aredifficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons, including the extent of contamination, alternative treatment methods that may be applied, location of the property which subjects it to differing local laws and regulations and theirinterpretations, as well as the time it takes to remediate contamination and receive regulatory approval. In developing our   10 Table of Contentsliability for estimated environmental remediation obligations on a property by property basis, we consider among other things, enacted laws and regulations, assessments of contamination andsurrounding geology, quality of information available, currently available technologies for treatment, alternative methods of remediation and prior experience. Environmental accruals are based on estimates which are subject to significant change,and are adjusted as the remediation treatment progresses, as circumstances change and as environmental contingencies become more clearly defined and reasonably estimable. We expect to adjust the accrued liabilities for environmental remediationobligations reflected in our consolidated financial statements as they become probable and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. We measure our environmental remediation liability at fair value based on expected future net cash flows, adjusted for inflation, and thendiscount them to present value. We adjust our environmental remediation liability quarterly to reflect changes in projected expenditures, changes in present value due to the passage of time and reductions in estimated liabilities as a result ofactual expenditures incurred during each quarter. As of December 31, 2015, we had accrued a total of $84.3 million for our prospective environmental remediation liability. This accrual includes (a) $38.9 million, which was our bestestimate of reasonably estimable environmental remediation obligations and obligations to remove USTs for which we are the title owner, net of estimated recoveries and (b) $45.4 million for future environmental liabilities related topreexisting unknown contamination.  We cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations may be enacted in the future, or howexisting laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted with respect to products or activities to which they have not previously been applied. We cannot predict if state UST fund programs will be administered and funded in the future in amanner that is consistent with past practices and if future environmental spending will continue to be eligible for reimbursement at historical recovery rates under these programs. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as morevigorous enforcement policies of the regulatory agencies or stricter interpretation of existing laws, which may develop in the future, could have an adverse effect on our financial position, or that of our tenants, and could require substantialadditional expenditures for future remediation.  As a result of the factors discussed above, or others, compliance with environmental lawsand regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. We are exposed to counterparty risk and there can be no assurances that we will effectively manage or mitigate this risk. We regularly interact with counterparties in various industries. The types of counterparties most common to our transactions and agreementsinclude, but are not limited to, landlords, tenants, vendors and lenders. We also enter into agreements to acquire and sell properties which allocate responsibility for certain costs to the counterparty. Our most significant counterparties include,but are not limited to, the members of the Bank Syndicate related to our Credit Agreement, the lender that is the counterparty to the Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement and our major tenants from whom we derive a significant amount ofrental revenue. The default, insolvency or other inability or unwillingness of a significant counterparty to perform its obligations under an agreement or transaction, including, without limitation, as a result of the rejection of an agreement ortransaction in bankruptcy proceedings, is likely to have a material adverse effect on us. As of December 31, 2015, we leased 169 convenience store and gasoline station properties pursuant to three separate unitary leases to subsidiaries ofGlobal Partners, LP (NYSE: GLP) (Global Partners). Two of these leases were assigned to subsidiaries of Global Partners in June 2015 by our former tenants, White Oak Petroleum, LLC and Big Apple Petroleum Realty, LLC (both affiliates ofCapitol Petroleum Group, LLC). In the aggregate, our leases with subsidiaries of Global Partners represented 21% and 13% of our rental revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. All three of our leases withsubsidiaries of Global Partners are guaranteed by the parent company. As of December 31, 2015, we leased 84 convenience store and gasoline station properties pursuant to three separate unitary leases to subsidiaries of Chestnut Petroleum Dist.Inc. (Chestnut Petroleum). In the aggregate, our leases with subsidiaries of Chestnut Petroleum represented 16% and 19% of our rental revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The largest of theseunitary leases, accounting for 57 of our properties, is guaranteed by the parent company, its principals and numerous Chestnut Petroleum affiliates. As of December 31, 2015, we leased 77 convenience store and gasoline station propertiespursuant to three separate unitary leases to Apro, LLC (d/b/a United Oil). In the aggregate, our leases with United Oil represented 9% of our rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. See Item 9B in this AnnualReport on Form 10-K for selected combined audited financial data of United Oil. We may also undertake additional transactions with these or other existing tenants which would further concentrate our sources of rental revenues. Many of our tenants,including those noted above, are part of larger corporate organizations and the financial distress of one subsidiary or other affiliated companies or businesses in those organizations may negatively impact the ability or willingness of our tenant toperform its obligations under its lease with us. The failure of a major tenant or their default in their rental and other obligations to us is likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations,liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.  Because certain of our tenants are not rated and their financial information is not availableto you, it may be difficult for our investors to determine their creditworthiness.  The majority of our properties are leased totenants who are not rated by any nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. In addition, our tenants financial information is not generally available to our investors. Additionally, many of our tenants are part of larger corporateorganizations and we do not receive financial information for the other entities in those   11 Table of Contentsorganizations. The financial distress of other affiliated companies or businesses in those organizations may negatively impact the ability or willingness of our tenant to perform its obligationsunder its lease with us. Because of the lack of financial information or credit ratings it is, therefore, difficult for our investors to assess the creditworthiness of our tenants and to determine the ability of a tenant to meet its obligations tous. It is possible that the assumptions and estimates we make after reviewing publicly and privately obtained information about our tenants are not accurate and that we may be required to increase reserves for bad debts, record allowances fordeferred rent receivable or record additional expenses if our tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations to us.  Our future cash flowis dependent on the performance of our tenants of their lease obligations, renewal of existing leases and either re-leasing or selling our transitional properties. We are subject to risks that financial distress, default or bankruptcy of our tenants may lead to vacancy at our properties or disruption inrent receipts as a result of partial payment or nonpayment of rent or that expiring leases may not be renewed. Under unfavorable general economic conditions, there can be no assurance that our tenants level of sales and financial performancegenerally will not be adversely affected, which in turn, could negatively impact our rental revenues. We are subject to risks that the terms governing renewal or re-leasing of our properties (including, compliance with numerous federal, state andlocal laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment, such as the remediation of contamination and the retirement and decommissioning or removal of long-lived assets, the cost of required renovations, or replacement of USTs andrelated equipment) may be less favorable than current lease terms (or prior lease terms in the case of vacant properties).  We are alsosubject to the risk that we may receive less net proceeds from the properties we sell as compared to their current carrying value or that the value of our properties may be adversely affected by unfavorable general economic conditions. Unfavorablegeneral economic conditions may also negatively impact our ability to re-lease or sell our transitional properties. Numerous properties compete with our properties in attracting tenants to lease space. The number of available or competitiveproperties in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease or sell our properties and on the rents we are able to charge. In addition to the risk of disruption in rent receipts, we are subject to the risk ofincurring real estate taxes, maintenance, environmental and other expenses at vacant properties. The financial distress, default or bankruptcy of our tenants may also lead to protracted and expensive processes for retaking control of our propertiesthan would otherwise be the case, including, eviction or other legal proceedings related to or resulting from the tenants default. These risks are greater with respect to certain of our tenants who lease multiple properties from us. If atenant files for bankruptcy protection it is possible that we would recover substantially less than the full value of our claims against the tenant. If our tenants do not perform their lease obligations; or we are unable to renew existing leases andpromptly recapture and re-lease or sell our transitional properties; or if lease terms upon renewal or re-leasing are less favorable than current or historical lease terms; or if the values of properties that we sell are adversely affected by marketconditions; or if we incur significant costs or disruption related to or resulting from tenant financial distress, default or bankruptcy; then our cash flow could be significantly adversely affected. As of December 31, 2015, our 46 transitional properties were comprised of (i) eight properties subject to the NECG Lease,(ii) 15 properties occupied under month-to-month license agreements and (iii) 23 properties that are vacant. See Business  Company Operations  Transitional Properties, NECG Lease Restructuring andMonth-to-Month License Agreements in Note 2 in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We are dependent on external sources of capital which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. We are dependent on external sources of capital to maintain our status as a REIT and must distribute to our shareholders each year at least90% of our net taxable income, excluding any net capital gain. Because of these distribution requirements, it is not likely that we will be able to fund all future capital needs, including acquisitions, from income from operations. Therefore, wewill have to continue to rely on third-party sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. We may need to access the capital markets in order to execute future significant acquisitions. There can be noassurance that sources of capital will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.  Our principal sources of liquidity are our cashflows from operations, funds available under our $225.0 million Credit Agreement with a group of banks led by Bank of America, N.A. The Credit Agreement consists of a $175.0 million Revolving Facility, which is scheduled to mature in June 2018 and a$50.0 million Term Loan, which is scheduled to mature in June 2020. Subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement and our continued compliance with its provisions, we have the option to (a) extend the term of the Revolving Facility for oneadditional year to June 2019 and (b) increase by $75.0 million the amount of the Revolving Facility to $250.0 million. On June 2, 2015, we entered into the Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement, amending and restating our existingsenior secured note purchase agreement with Prudential and an affiliate of Prudential. Pursuant to the Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement, among other matters, Prudential and its affiliate, redenominated the existing notes in the aggregateamount of $100.0 million issued under the existing note purchase agreement as senior unsecured Series A Notes, and issued $75.0 million of senior unsecured Series B Notes bearing interest at 5.35% and maturing in June 2023 to Prudentialand certain affiliates of Prudential. The Series A Notes continue to bear interest at 6.0% and mature in February 2021. For additional information, please refer to Credit Agreement and Senior Unsecured Notes in Note 4 inItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.   12 Table of ContentsEach of the Credit Agreement and the Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement containscustomary financial and other covenants such as leverage and coverage ratios and minimum tangible net worth, as well as limitations on restricted payments, which may limit our ability to incur additional debt or pay dividends. The Credit Agreementcontains customary events of default, including default under the Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement, change of control and failure to maintain REIT status. The Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement contains customary events ofdefault, including default under the Credit Agreement and failure to maintain REIT status. Our ability to meet the terms of the agreements is dependent on our continued ability to meet certain criteria as further described in Note 4 in Item 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the performance of our tenants and the other risks described in this section. If we are not in compliance with one or more of our covenants, whichcould result in an event of default under our Credit Agreement or our Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement, there can be no assurance that our lenders would waive such non-compliance. This could have a material adverse effect on our business,financial condition, results of operation, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.  Our access to third-party sources ofcapital depends upon a number of factors including general market conditions, the markets perception of our growth potential, financial stability, our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions, covenants and limitationsimposed under our Credit Agreement and Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement and the market price of our common stock.  We are repositioningour transitional properties and may incur additional costs associated with repositioning these properties which may materially negatively impact our cash flow and ability to pay dividends. We are repositioning our transitional properties and expect that we will sell, enter into new leases or modify existing leases on theseproperties over time. The timing of pending or anticipated transactions may be affected by factors beyond our control and we cannot predict when or on what terms sales or leases will ultimately be consummated. It is possible that when we complete the repositioning of individual transitional properties, we will generate less net revenue from theseproperties than we are currently generating or we may be responsible for the payment of certain operating expenses, environmental compliance costs and costs associated with any environmental remediation. The incurrence of these expenses maymaterially negatively impact our cash flow and ability to pay dividends.  We are continuing our efforts to sell certain properties. We cannotpredict the terms or timing of any such property dispositions. If we do not obtain favorable terms on such dispositions, our operations and financial performance may be negatively impacted. We are continuing our efforts to sell properties, including those properties which are accounted for as held for sale. While we have dedicatedconsiderable effort designed to increase sales activity, we cannot predict if or when property dispositions will close and whether the terms of any such disposition will be favorable to us. It is likely that we will retain environmental liabilitiesthat exist with respect to that property or group of properties prior to the date of sale. If we do not obtain favorable terms on such dispositions, our operations and financial performance will be negatively impacted. Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial position and results of operations, and they requiremanagement to make estimates, judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain.  Our accounting policies andmethods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial position and results of operations. We have identified several accounting policies as being critical to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations becausethey require management to make particularly subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be recorded under different conditions or using differentassumptions. We cannot provide any assurance that we will not make subsequent significant adjustments to our consolidated financial statements. Estimates, judgments and assumptions underlying our consolidated financial statements include, but arenot limited to, receivables and related reserves, deferred rent receivable, income under direct financing leases, asset retirement obligations including environmental remediation obligations and future environmental liabilities for pre-existingunknown environmental contamination, real estate, depreciation and amortization, carrying value of our properties, impairment of long-lived assets, litigation, accrued liabilities, income taxes and allocation of the purchase price of propertiesacquired to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  If our accounting policies, methods, judgments, assumptions, estimates andallocations prove to be incorrect, or if circumstances change, our business, financial condition, revenues, operating expense, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price may be materially adversely affected.   13 Table of ContentsOur business operations may not generate sufficient cash for distributions or debt service. There is no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to usin an amount sufficient to enable us to pay dividends on our common stock, to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may not be able to repay or refinance existing indebtedness on favorable terms, which could force us todispose of properties on disadvantageous terms (which may also result in losses) or accept financing on unfavorable terms.  We may acquire newproperties and this may create risks.  We may acquire or develop properties when we believe that an acquisition or developmentmatches our business and investment strategies. These properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential. It is possible that the operating performance of these properties maydecline after we acquire them, they may not perform as expected and, if financed by the Company using debt or new equity issuances, may result in shareholder dilution. Our acquisition of properties will expose us to the liabilities of thoseproperties, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition. We face competition in pursuing these acquisitions and we may not succeed in leasing acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover their costs of acquisition andoperations.  Newly acquired properties may require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoingbusiness. We may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions. Consequences arising from or in connection with any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity,ability to pay dividends or stock price.  We are pursuing redevelopment opportunities and this creates risks to our Company. We have commenced a program to redevelop certain of our transitional properties and to recapture select properties from our net leaseportfolio in order to redevelop such properties for alternative uses. The success at each stage of our redevelopment program is dependent on numerous factors and risks including our ability to identify and extract preferred sites from our portfolioand successfully prepare and market them for alternative uses, and project development issues, including those relating to planning, zoning, licensing, permitting, third party and governmental authorizations, changes in local market conditions,increases in construction costs, the availability and cost of financing, and issues arising from possible discovery of new environmental contamination and the need to conduct environmental remediation. Occupancy rates and rents at any particularredeveloped property may fail to meet our original expectations for a number of reasons beyond our control, including changes in market and economic conditions and the development by competitors of competing properties. We could experience increasedand unexpected costs or significant delays or abandonment of some or all of these redevelopment opportunities. For any of the above-described reasons, and others, we may determine to abandon opportunities that we have already begun to explore orwith respect to which we have commenced redevelopment efforts and, as a result, we may fail to recover expenses already incurred. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully redevelop and lease any of our identified opportunities orthat our overall redevelopment program will be successful. Consequences arising from or in connection with any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability topay dividends or stock price.  We may not be able to successfully implement our investment strategy. We may not be able to successfully implement our investment strategy. We cannot assure you that our portfolio of properties will expand atall, or if it will expand at any specified rate or to any specified size. As part of our overall growth strategy, we regularly review acquisition, financing and development opportunities, and we expect to continue to pursue investments that webelieve will benefit our financial performance. We cannot assure you that investment opportunities will be available which meet our investment criteria. Pursuing our investment opportunities may result in the issuance of new equity securities of theCompany that may initially be dilutive to our net income, and such investments may not perform as we expect or produce the returns that we anticipate (including, without limitation, as a result of tenant bankruptcies, tenant concessions, ourinability to collect rents and higher than anticipated operating expenses). Further, we may not successfully integrate investments into our existing portfolio without operating disruptions or unanticipated costs. To the extent that our currentsources of liquidity are not sufficient to fund such investments, we will require other sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Additionally, to the extent we increase the size of our portfolio, we may notbe able to adapt our management, administrative, accounting and operational systems, or hire and retain sufficient operational staff to integrate investments into our portfolio or manage any future investments without operating disruptions orunanticipated costs. Moreover, our continued growth will require increased investment in management personnel, professional fees, other personnel, financial and management systems and controls and facilities, which will result in additionaloperating expenses. Under the circumstances described above, our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects may be materially adversely affected.  We are subject to risks inherent in owning and leasing real estate. We are subject to varying degrees of risk generally related to leasing and owning real estate many of which are beyond our control. Inaddition to general risks applicable to us, our risks include, among others: our liability as a lessee for long-term lease obligations regardless of our revenues; deterioration in national, regional and local economic and real estate marketconditions; potential changes in supply of, or demand for, rental properties similar to ours; competition for tenants and declining rental rates; difficulty in selling or re-leasing properties on favorable terms or at all; impairments in our abilityto collect rent or other payments due to us when they are due; increases in interest rates and adverse changes in the availability, cost and terms of financing; uninsured property liability; the impact of present or future environmental legislationand compliance with environmental laws; adverse changes in zoning laws and other regulations; acts of terrorism and war; acts of God; the potential risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time the need to periodically renovate and repairour properties; and physical or weather-related damage to our properties.  Certain significant expenditures generally do not change inresponse to economic or other conditions, including: (i) debt service, (ii) real estate taxes, (iii) environmental remediation costs and (iv) operating and maintenance costs. The combination of variable revenue and relativelyfixed expenditures may result, under certain market conditions, in reduced earnings and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. Each of the factors listed above could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity,ability to pay dividends or stock price. In addition, real estate investments are relatively illiquid, which means that our ability to vary our portfolio of properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be limited.   14 Table of ContentsAdverse developments in general business, economic or political conditions could have a material adverseeffect on us.  Adverse developments in general business and economic conditions, including through recession, downturn orotherwise, either in the economy generally or in those regions in which a large portion of our business is conducted, could have a material adverse effect on us and significantly increase certain of the risks we are subject to. Among other effects,adverse economic conditions could depress real estate values, impact our ability to re-let or sell our properties and have an adverse effect on our tenants level of sales and financial performance generally. Our revenues are dependent on theeconomic success of our tenants and any factors that adversely impact our tenants could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. Substantially all of our tenants depend on the same industry for their revenues. We derive substantially all of our revenues from leasing, primarily on a triple-net basis, and financing convenience store and gasolinestation properties to tenants in the petroleum marketing industry. Accordingly, our revenues are substantially dependent on the economic success of the petroleum marketing industry, and any factors that adversely affect that industry, such asdisruption in the supply of petroleum or a decrease in the demand for conventional motor fuels due to conservation, technological advancements in petroleum-fueled motor vehicles or an increase in the use of alternative fuel vehicles, or greentechnology could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. The success of participants in the petroleum marketing industry depends uponthe sale of refined petroleum products at margins in excess of fixed and variable expenses. The petroleum marketing industry is highly competitive and volatile. Petroleum products are commodities, the prices of which depend on numerous factors thataffect supply and demand. The prices paid by our tenants and other petroleum marketers for products are affected by global, national and regional factors. A large, rapid increase in wholesale petroleum prices would adversely affect the profitabilityand cash flows of our tenants if the increased cost of petroleum products could not be passed on to their customers or if automobile consumption of gasoline was to decline significantly. We cannot be certain how these factors will affect petroleumproduct prices or supply in the future, or how in particular they will affect our tenants.  Property taxes on our properties may increase withoutnotice.  Each of the properties we own or lease is subject to real property taxes. The leases for certain of the properties thatwe lease from third-parties obligate us to pay real property taxes with regard to those properties. The real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we acquire or lease in the future may increase as property tax rates changeand as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities. To the extent that our tenants are not responsible for property taxes pursuant to their contractual arrangements with us or are unable or unwilling to pay such increase inaccordance with their leases, our net operating expenses may increase.  We are defending pending lawsuits and claims and are subject to materiallosses.  We are subject to various lawsuits and claims, including litigation related to environmental matters, such as thosearising from leaking USTs, contamination of groundwater with methyl tertiary butyl ether (a fuel derived from methanol, commonly referred to as MTBE) and releases of motor fuel into the environment, and toxic tort claims. For example, weare currently involved in several proceedings described in Item 3. Legal Proceedings in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The ultimate resolution of certain matters cannot be predicted because considerable uncertainty exists both in termsof the probability of loss and the estimate of such loss. Our ultimate liabilities resulting from the lawsuits and claims we face could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, abilityto pay dividends or stock price. For additional information with respect to pending environmental lawsuits and claims and environmental remediation obligations and estimates see Item 3. Legal Proceedings, EnvironmentalMatters in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Notes 3 and 5 in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  A significant portion of our properties are concentrated in the Northeast and Mid-Atlanticregions of the United States, and adverse conditions in those regions, in particular, could negatively impact our operations.  Asignificant portion of the properties we own and lease are located in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States and approximately 57% of our properties are concentrated in three states (New York, Massachusetts and Connecticut).Because of the concentration of our properties in those regions, in the event of adverse economic conditions in those regions, we would likely experience higher risk of default on payment of rent to us than if our properties were more geographicallydiversified. Additionally, the rents on our properties may be subject to a greater risk of default than other properties in the event of adverse economic, political or business developments or natural hazards that may affect the Northeast orMid-Atlantic regions of the United States and the ability of our lessees to make rent payments. This lack of geographical diversification could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity,ability to pay dividends or stock price.   15 Table of ContentsWe are in a competitive business. The real estate industry is highly competitive. Where we own properties, we compete for tenants with a large number of real estate propertyowners and other companies that sublet properties. Our principal means of competition are rents we are able to charge in relation to the income producing potential of the location. In addition, we expect other major real estate investors, some withmuch greater financial resources or more experienced personnel than we have, will compete with us for attractive acquisition opportunities. These competitors include petroleum manufacturing, distributing and marketing companies, other REITs, publicand private investment funds, and other individual and institutional investors. This competition has increased prices for properties we seek to acquire and may impair our ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms in thefuture.  We are subject to losses that may not be covered by insurance. We, and certain of our tenants, carry insurance against certain risks and in such amounts as we believe are customary for businesses of ourkind. However, as the costs and availability of insurance change, we may decide not to be covered against certain losses (such as certain environmental liabilities, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and civil disorder) where, in the judgment ofmanagement, the insurance is not warranted due to cost or availability of coverage or the remoteness of perceived risk. Furthermore, there are certain types of losses, such as losses resulting from wars, terrorism or certain acts of God, thatgenerally are not insured because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. There is no assurance that the existing insurance coverages are or will be sufficient to cover actual losses incurred. The destruction of, or significantdamage to, or significant liabilities arising out of conditions at, our properties due to an uninsured loss would result in an economic loss and could result in us losing both our investment in, and anticipated profits from, such properties. When aloss is insured, the coverage may be insufficient in amount or duration, or a lessees customers may be lost, such that the lessee cannot resume its business after the loss at prior levels or at all, resulting in reduced rent or a default underits lease. Any such loss relating to a large number of properties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. Failure to qualify as a REIT under the federal income tax laws would have adverse consequences to our shareholders. Uncertain tax matters may have asignificant impact on the results of operations for any single fiscal year or interim period or may cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT. We elected to be treated as a REIT under the federal income tax laws beginning January 1, 2001. To qualify for taxation as a REIT, wemust, among other requirements such as those related to the composition of our assets and gross income, distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income, including taxable income that is accrued by us without acorresponding receipt of cash. Accordingly, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on qualifying REIT income, provided that distributions to our shareholders equal at least the amount of our taxable income as defined under theInternal Revenue Code.  Many of the REIT requirements are highly technical and complex. If we were to fail to meet the requirements, or ifthe Internal Revenue Service were to successfully assert that our earnings and profits were greater than the amount distributed, we may be subject to federal income tax, excise taxes, penalties and interest or we may have to pay a deficiencydividend to eliminate any earnings and profits that were not distributed. We may have to borrow money or sell assets to pay such a deficiency dividend. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to qualify in the future as a REIT. We cannot give any assurance that new legislation, regulations,administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the requirements relating to our qualification. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing ourtaxable income and will again be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates, we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax, we could be required to pay significant income taxes and we would have less money available forour operations and distributions to shareholders. This would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities. We could also be precluded from treatment as a REIT for four taxable years following the year in which we lost thequalification, and all distributions to shareholders would be taxable as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Loss of our REIT status could have a material adverse effect on our business,financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.  We are exposed to interest rate risk and there canbe no assurances that we will manage or mitigate this risk effectively.  We are exposed to interest rate risk, primarily as aresult of our Credit Agreement. Borrowings under our Credit Agreement bear interest at a floating rate. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates will increase the amount of interest we must pay under our Credit Agreement. Our interest rate riskmay materially change in the future if we increase our borrowings under the Credit Agreement, or amend our Credit Agreement or Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement, seek other sources of debt or equity capital or refinance our outstandingdebt. A significant increase in interest rates could also make it more difficult to find alternative financing on desirable terms. For additional information with respect to interest rate risk, see Item 7A. Quantitative and QualitativeDisclosures About Market Risk as filed with this Annual Report on Form 10-K.   16 Table of ContentsFuture issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our equity securities. Our future growth will depend upon our ability to raise additional capital. If we were to raise additional capital through theissuance of equity securities, we could dilute the interest of holders of our common stock. The interest of our common stockholders could also be diluted by the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to stock incentive plans. Accordingly, theBoard of Directors may authorize the issuance of equity securities that could dilute, or otherwise adversely affect, the interest of holders of our common stock. We may change our dividend policy and the dividends we pay may be subject to significant volatility. The decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such futuredividends, will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on such factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant. In addition, our Credit Agreement and our Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement prohibit the paymentsof dividends during certain events of default. No assurance can be given that our financial performance in the future will permit our payment of any dividends or that the amount of dividends we pay, if any, will not fluctuate significantly. Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, our ability to pay dividends would be restricted if, after payment of the dividend, (1) wewould not be able to pay indebtedness as it becomes due in the usual course of business or (2) our total assets would be less than the sum of our liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if we were to be dissolved, to satisfy therights of any shareholders with liquidation preferences. There currently are no shareholders with liquidation preferences.  To qualify fortaxation as a REIT, we must, among other requirements such as those related to the composition of our assets and gross income, distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income, including taxable income that is accrued by uswithout a corresponding receipt of cash. We cannot provide any assurance that our cash flows will permit us to continue paying cash dividends. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has allowed the use of a procedure, as a result of which we could satisfy the REIT incomedistribution requirement by making a distribution on our common stock comprised of (i) shares of our common stock having a value of up to 80% of the total distribution and (ii) cash in the remaining amount of the total distribution, inlieu of paying the distribution entirely in cash. In January 2015, we received a private letter ruling from the IRS that allows us to use such a procedure. It is also possible that instead of distributing 100% of our taxable income on an annual basis, we may decide to retain a portion of ourtaxable income and to pay taxes on such amounts as permitted by the IRS. In the event that we pay a portion of a dividend in shares of our common stock, taxable U.S. shareholders would be required to pay tax on the entire amount of the dividend,including the portion paid in shares of common stock, in which case such shareholders might have to pay the tax using cash from other sources. If a U.S. shareholder sells the stock he, she or it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, thesales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our common stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to non-U.S. shareholders, we may be required to withholdU.S. tax with respect to such dividend, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock. In addition, if a significant number of our shareholders sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed ondividends, such sales would put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock.  As a result of the factors described hereinand elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and those that are described from time to time in our other filings with the SEC, we may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis, which couldmaterially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, revenues, operating expenses, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or our stock price. Changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded common stock. As with other publicly traded securities, the market price of our publicly traded common stock depends on various market conditions, which maychange from time-to-time. Among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded common stock are the following: our financial condition and performance and that of our significant tenants; the markets perceptionof our growth potential and potential future earnings; the reputation of REITs generally and the reputation of REITs with portfolios similar to us; the attractiveness of the securities of REITs in comparison to securities issued by other entities(including securities issued by other real estate companies); an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for publicly traded securities; the extent ofinstitutional investor interest in us; and general economic and financial market conditions.   17 Table of ContentsIn order to preserve our REIT status, our charter limits the number of shares a person may own, which maydiscourage a takeover that could result in a premium price for our common stock or otherwise benefit our stockholders.  Ourcharter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our Board of Directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Unless exempted by our Board of Directors, no person mayactually or constructively own more than 5% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding shares of our common stock or the outstanding shares of any class or series of our preferred stock, which may inhibit largeinvestors from desiring to purchase our stock. This restriction may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially allof our assets) that might provide a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders.  Maryland law maydiscourage a third-party from acquiring us.  We are subject to the provisions of the Maryland Business Combination Act (theBusiness Combination Act) which prohibits transactions between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interestedstockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Generally, pursuant to the Business Combination Act, an interested stockholder is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10% ormore of a Maryland corporations voting stock. These provisions could have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of our Company or reducing the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future forshares of our capital stock. Additionally, the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act may deny voting rights to shares involved in an acquisition of one-tenth or more of the voting stock of a Maryland corporation. In our charter and bylaws, we haveelected not to have the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act apply to any acquisition by any person of shares of stock of our Company. However, in the case of the control share acquisition statute, our Board of Directors may opt to make thisstatute applicable to us at any time by amending our bylaws, and may do so on a retroactive basis. Finally, the unsolicited takeovers provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law permit our Board of Directors, without stockholderapproval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to implement certain provisions that may have the effect of inhibiting a third-party from making an acquisition proposal for our Company or of delaying, deferring orpreventing a change in control of our Company under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price or that stockholders may otherwise believe isin their best interests.  Inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Although inflation has not materially impacted our results of operations in the recent past, increased inflation could have a more pronouncednegative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations. During times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, as provided for in our leases, rent increases may not keep up with the rate ofinflation. Likewise, even though our triple-net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation, substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operatingexpenses exceed increases in revenue, which may adversely affect our tenants ability to pay rent.  The loss of certain members of ourmanagement team could adversely affect our business.  Our future success and ability to implement our business and investmentstrategy depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key management personnel and on the continued contributions of members of our senior management team, each of whom would be difficult to replace. As a REIT, we employ only 32 employeesand have a cost-effective management structure. We do not have any employment agreements with any of our executives. In the event of the loss of key management personnel, or upon unexpected death, disability or retirement, we may not be able to findreplacements with comparable skill, ability and industry expertise which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. Amendments to the Accounting Standards Codification made by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) or changes in accountingstandards issued by other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability or financial position. Our consolidated financial statements are subject to the application of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) inaccordance with the Accounting Standards Codification, which is periodically amended by the FASB. The application of GAAP is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, we are required to adopt amendments to the AccountingStandards Codification or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time-to-time by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB and the SEC. Those changes could adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability orfinancial position.   18 Table of ContentsOur assets may be subject to impairment charges. We periodically evaluate our real estate investments and other assets for impairment indicators. The judgment regarding the existence ofimpairment indicators is based on GAAP, and includes a variety of factors such as market conditions, the accumulation of asset retirement costs due to changes in estimates associated with our estimated environmental liabilities, the status ofsignificant leases, the financial condition of major tenants and other assumptions and factors that could affect the cash flow from or fair value of our properties. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we incurred $17.4 millionand $21.5 million, respectively, of non-cash impairment charges. We may be required to take similar non-cash impairment charges, which could affect the implementation of our current business strategy and have a material adverse effect on ourfinancial condition and results of operations.  Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the market on which our common stocktrades, the markets in which we operate, our operations and our results of operations.  Terrorist attacks or other acts ofviolence or war could affect our business or the businesses of our tenants. The consequences of armed conflicts are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. More generally, any of theseevents could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States and worldwide financial markets and economy. Terrorist attacks also could be a factor resulting in, or a continuation of, aneconomic recession in the United States or abroad. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. We rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology couldharm our business.  We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and storeelectronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, including financial transactions and maintenance of records, which may include personal identifying information of tenants and lease data. We rely on commerciallyavailable systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting and storing confidential tenant information, such as individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts. Although we have takensteps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems, it is possible that our security measures will not be able to prevent the systems improper functioning, or the improper disclosure of personally identifiableinformation such as in the event of cyberattacks. Security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure ofconfidential information. Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and couldmaterially and adversely affect us"
3,GTY,GETTY REALTY CORP,2015-03-16,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
 We are subject to various risks, many of which are beyond our control. As a result of these and other factors, we mayexperience material fluctuations in our future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stockprice. An investment in our stock involves various risks, including those mentioned below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and those that are described from time to time in our other filings with the SEC. We incur significant operating costs as a result of environmental laws and regulations which costs could significantly rise and reduceour profitability.  We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, including mattersrelating to the protection of the environment. Under certain environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances orpetroleum products at, on, or under, such property, and may be required to investigate and clean-up such contamination. Such laws typically impose liability and clean-up responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of orcaused the presence of the contaminants, or the timing or cause of the contamination, and the liability under such laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation ofresponsibility. For example, liability may arise as a result of the historical use of a property or from the migration of contamination from adjacent or nearby properties. Any such contamination or liability may also reduce the value of theproperty. In addition, the owner or operator of a property may be subject to claims by third-parties based on injury, damage and/or costs, including investigation and clean-up costs, resulting from environmental contamination present at or emanatingfrom a property. The properties owned or controlled by us are leased primarily as retail motor fuel and convenience store properties, and therefore may contain, or may have contained, USTs for the storage of petroleum products and other hazardous ortoxic substances, which creates a potential for the release of such products or substances. Some of our properties may be subject to regulations regarding the retirement and decommissioning or removal of long-lived assets including buildingscontaining hazardous materials, USTs and other equipment. Some of the properties may be adjacent to or near properties that have contained or currently contain USTs used to store petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. Inaddition, certain of the properties are on, adjacent to, or near properties upon which others have engaged or may in the future engage in activities that may release petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. There may be otherenvironmental problems associated with our properties of which we are unaware. These problems may make it more difficult for us to re-let or sell our properties on favorable terms, or at all. For additional information with respect to pending environmental lawsuits and claims, and environmental remediationobligations and estimates see Item 3. Legal Proceedings, Environmental Matters in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and notes 3 and 5 in Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We enter into leases and various other agreements which contractually allocate responsibility between the parties for knownand unknown environmental liabilities at or relating to the subject properties. We are contingently liable for these environmental obligations in the event that the counterparty to the lease or other agreement does not satisfy them. It is possiblethat our assumptions regarding the ultimate allocation method and share of responsibility that we used to allocate environmental liabilities may change, which may result in material adjustments to the amounts recorded for environmental litigationaccruals and environmental remediation   9 Table of Contentsliabilities. We are required to accrue for environmental liabilities that we believe are allocable to others under our leases and other agreements if we determine that it is probable that thecounterparty will not meet its environmental obligations. We may ultimately be responsible to pay for environmental liabilities as the property owner if the counterparty fails to pay them. As a result of Marketings bankruptcy filing, weaccrued for significant additional environmental liabilities because we concluded that Marketing would not be able to perform them. A liability has not been accrued for environmental obligations that are the responsibility of any other currenttenants based on those tenants history of paying such obligations and/or our assessment of their financial ability and intent to pay such costs. However, there can be no assurance that our assessments or estimates are correct or that ourtenants who have paid their obligations in the past will continue to do so. The ultimate resolution of these matters could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to paydividends or stock price.  For all of our triple-net leases, our tenants are contractually responsible for compliance withenvironmental laws and regulations, removal of USTs at the end of their lease term and remediation of any environmental contamination that arises during the term of their tenancy. Under the terms of our leases covering properties previously leasedto Marketing, we have agreed to be responsible for environmental contamination at the premises that was known at the time the lease commenced, and that existed prior to commencement of the lease and is discovered (other than as a result of avoluntary site investigation) during the first ten years of the lease term. After expiration of such ten year period, responsibility for all newly discovered contamination, even if it relates to periods prior to commencement of the lease, iscontractually allocated to our tenant. Our tenants at properties previously leased to Marketing are in all cases responsible for the cost of any remediation of contamination that results from their use and occupancy of our properties. Undersubstantially all of our other triple-net leases, responsibility for remediation of all environmental contamination discovered during the term of the lease (including known and unknown contamination that existed prior to commencement of the lease)is the responsibility of our tenant.  We anticipate that a majority of the USTs at properties previously leased toMarketing will be replaced over the next decade because these USTs are either at or near the end of their useful lives. For long-term, triple-net leases covering sites previously leased to Marketing, our tenants are responsible for the cost ofremoval and replacement of USTs and for remediation of contamination found during such UST removal and replacement, unless such contamination was found during the first ten years of the lease term and also existed prior to commencement of the lease.In those cases, we are responsible for costs associated with the remediation of such contamination. For our transitional properties occupied under month-to-month license agreements, or which are vacant, we are responsible for costs associated withUST removals and for the cost of remediation of contamination found during the removal of USTs. We have also agreed to be responsible for environmental contamination that existed prior to the sale of certain properties assuming the contamination isdiscovered (other than as a result of a voluntary site investigation) during the first five years after the sale of the properties. (For additional information regarding our transitional properties, see Item 1. Business  CompanyOperations and Transitional Properties in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations which appear in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.) After the termination of the Master Lease, we commenced a process to take control of our properties and to reposition them. Asubstantial portion of these properties had USTs which were either at or near the end of their useful lives. For properties that we sold, we elected to remove certain of these USTs and in the course of re-letting properties, we made leaseconcessions to reimburse our tenants at operating gas stations for certain capital expenditures including UST replacements. In the course of these UST removals and replacements, previously unknown environmental contamination has been and continuesto be discovered. As a result of these developments, we began to assess our prospective future environmental liability resulting from preexisting unknown environmental contamination which we believe might be discovered during removal and replacementof USTs at properties previously leased to Marketing in the future.  We are now able to develop a reasonable estimate offair value for the prospective future environmental liability resulting from preexisting unknown environmental contamination. These estimates are based primarily upon quantifiable trends, which we believe allow us to make reasonable estimates offair value for the future costs of environmental remediation resulting from the removal and replacement of USTs. As a result, at December 31, 2014, we accrued for these estimated costs. Our accrual of the additional liability represents thebest estimate of the fair value of cost for each component of the liability net of estimated recoveries from state UST remediation funds considering estimated recovery rates developed from prior experience with the funds. In arriving at our accrual,we analyzed the ages of USTs at properties where we would be responsible for preexisting contamination found within the ten years after commencement of a lease (for properties subject to long-term triple-net leases) or five years from a sale (fordivested properties), and projected a cost to closure for new environmental contamination. Based on these estimates, along with relevant economic and risk factors, at December 31, 2014, we accrued $49.7 million for these future environmentalliabilities related to preexisting unknown contamination. In conjunction with the accrual for preexisting unknown environmental contamination, we have increased the carrying value of our properties and simultaneously recorded impairment charges of$8.3 million where the increased carrying value of the property exceeded its estimated fair value. Our estimates are based upon facts that are known to us at this time and an assessment of the possible ultimate remedial action outcomes. It ispossible that our assumptions, which form the basis of our estimates, regarding our ultimate environmental liabilities may change, which may result in our providing an accrual, or adjustments to the amounts recorded, for environmental remediationliabilities. Among the many uncertainties that impact the estimates are our assumptions, the necessary regulatory approvals for, and potential modifications of remediation plans, the amount of data available upon initial  10 Table of Contentsassessment of contamination, changes in costs associated with environmental remediation services and equipment, the availability of state UST remediation funds and the possibility of existinglegal claims giving rise to additional claims. Additional environmental liabilities could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. Environmental exposures are difficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons, including the extent of contamination,alternative treatment methods that may be applied, location of the property which subjects it to differing local laws and regulations and their interpretations, as well as the time it takes to remediate contamination and receive regulatory approval.In developing our liability for estimated environmental remediation obligations on a property by property basis, we consider among other things, enacted laws and regulations, assessments of contamination and surrounding geology, quality ofinformation available, currently available technologies for treatment, alternative methods of remediation and prior experience. Environmental accruals are based on estimates which are subject to significant change, and are adjusted as theremediation treatment progresses, as circumstances change and as environmental contingencies become more clearly defined and reasonably estimable. We expect to adjust the accrued liabilities for environmental remediation obligations reflected in ourconsolidated financial statements as they become probable and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.  We measureour environmental remediation liability at fair value based on expected future net cash flows, adjusted for inflation, and then discount them to present value. We adjust our environmental remediation liability quarterly to reflect changes inprojected expenditures, changes in present value due to the passage of time and reductions in estimated liabilities as a result of actual expenditures incurred during each quarter. As of December 31, 2014, we had accrued a total of $91.6million for our prospective environmental remediation liability. This accrual includes (a) $41.9 million, which was our best estimate of reasonably estimable environmental remediation obligations and obligations to remove USTs for which we arethe title owner, net of estimated recoveries and (b) $49.7 million for future environmental liabilities related to preexisting unknown contamination. We cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations may be enacted in the future, or how existing laws orregulations will be administered or interpreted with respect to products or activities to which they have not previously been applied. We cannot predict if state UST fund programs will be administered and funded in the future in a manner that isconsistent with past practices and if future environmental spending will continue to be eligible for reimbursement at historical recovery rates under these programs. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorousenforcement policies of the regulatory agencies or stricter interpretation of existing laws, which may develop in the future, could have an adverse effect on our financial position, or that of our tenants, and could require substantial additionalexpenditures for future remediation.  As a result of the factors discussed above, or others, compliance with environmentallaws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. We are exposed to counterparty risk and there can be no assurances that we will effectively manage or mitigate this risk. We regularly interact with counterparties in various industries. The types of counterparties most common to our transactionsand agreements include, but are not limited to, landlords, tenants, vendors and lenders. We also enter into agreements to acquire and sell properties which allocate responsibility for certain costs to the counterparty. Our most significantcounterparties include, but are not limited to the members of the Bank Syndicate related to our Credit Agreement, the lender that is the counterparty to the Prudential Loan Agreement and our major tenants from whom we derive a significant amount ofrental revenue. The default, insolvency or other inability or unwillingness of a significant counterparty to perform its obligations under an agreement or transaction, including, without limitation, as a result of the rejection of an agreement ortransaction in bankruptcy proceedings, is likely to have a material adverse effect on us. As of December 31, 2014, we leased 118 gasoline station and convenience store properties in two separate unitary leases to subsidiaries of ChestnutPetroleum Dist. Inc., CPD NY Energy Corp. (CPD NY) and NECG Holdings Corp. (NECG). We lease 58 properties to CPD NY and 60 properties to NECG. CPD NY and NECG together represented 19%, 21% and 18% of our rental revenues forthe years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. It is possible that as a result of either leasing additional properties to Chestnut Petroleum Dist. or as a result of disposing some of our existing properties, Chestnut PetroleumDist. could account for a greater percentage of our rental revenues. In addition, as of December 31, 2014, we leased 97 gasoline station and convenience store properties in four separate unitary leases to subsidiaries of Capitol PetroleumGroup, LLC (Capitol). We lease 37 properties to White Oak Petroleum, LLC, 24 properties to Hudson Petroleum Realty, LLC, 20 properties to Dogwood Petroleum Realty, LLC and 16 properties to Big Apple Petroleum Realty, LLC. In aggregate,these Capitol affiliates represented 18%, 15% and 7% of our rental revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. It is possible that as a result of either leasing additional properties to Capitol or as a result ofdisposing some of our existing properties, Capitol could account for a greater percentage of our rental revenues. We may also undertake additional transactions with our other existing tenants which would further concentrate our sources of rentalrevenues. Although we have separate, non-cross defaulted leases with each of these subsidiaries, because such subsidiaries are affiliated with one another and under common control, a material adverse impact on one subsidiary, or failure of onesubsidiary to perform its rental and other obligations to us, may contribute to a material adverse impact on one or more of the other subsidiaries and/or failure of one or more of the other subsidiaries to perform its rental and other obligations tous. Additionally, our material tenants are part of larger corporate organizations and the financial distress of other affiliated companies or   11 Table of Contentsbusinesses in those organizations may negatively impact the ability or willingness of our tenant to perform its obligations under its lease with us. The failure of a major tenant or their defaultin their rental and other obligations to us is likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. Because our tenants are not rated and their financial information is not available to you, it may be difficult for our investors todetermine their creditworthiness.  The majority of our properties are leased to tenants who are not rated by anynationally recognized statistical rating organizations. In addition, our tenants financial information is not generally available to our investors. Additionally, our material tenants are part of larger corporate organizations and we do notreceive financial information for the other entities in those organizations. The financial distress of other affiliated companies or businesses in those organizations may negatively impact the ability or willingness of our tenant to perform itsobligations under its lease with us. Because of the lack of financial information or credit ratings it is, therefore, difficult for our investors to assess the creditworthiness of our tenants and to determine the ability of a tenant to meet itsobligations to us. It is possible that the assumptions and estimates we make after reviewing publicly and privately obtained information about our tenants are not accurate and that we may be required to increase reserves for bad debts, recordallowances for deferred rent receivable or record additional expenses if our tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations to us. Our future cash flow is dependent on the performance of our tenants of their lease obligations, renewal of existing leases and eitherre-letting or selling our transitional properties.  We are subject to risks that financial distress, default orbankruptcy of our tenants may lead to vacancy at our properties or disruption in rent receipts as a result of partial payment or nonpayment of rent or that expiring leases may not be renewed. Under unfavorable general economic conditions, there canbe no assurance that our tenants level of sales and financial performance generally will not be adversely affected, which in turn, could negatively impact our rental revenues. We are subject to risks that the terms governing renewal orre-letting of our properties (including, compliance with numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment, such as the remediation of contamination and the retirement and decommissioning or removalof long-lived assets, the cost of required renovations, or replacement of USTs and related equipment) may be less favorable than current lease terms (or prior lease terms in the case of vacant properties). We are also subject to the risk that we mayreceive less net proceeds from the properties we sell as compared to their current carrying value or that the value of our properties may be adversely affected by unfavorable general economic conditions. Unfavorable general economic conditions mayalso negatively impact our ability to re-let or sell our transitional properties. Numerous properties compete with our properties in attracting tenants to lease space. The number of available or competitive properties in a particular area could havea material adverse effect on our ability to lease or sell our properties and on the rents we are able to charge. In addition to the risk of disruption in rent receipts, we are subject to the risk of incurring real estate taxes, maintenance,environmental and other expenses at vacant properties.  The financial distress, default or bankruptcy of our tenants mayalso lead to protracted and expensive processes for retaking control of our properties than would otherwise be the case, including, eviction or other legal proceedings related to or resulting from the tenants default. These risks are greaterwith respect to certain of our tenants who lease multiple properties from us. See  Business  Company Operations  Transitional Properties for additional details. If a tenant files for bankruptcy protection it is possiblethat we would recover substantially less than the full value of our claims against the tenant. If our tenants do not perform their lease obligations; or we are unable to renew existing leases and promptly recapture and re-let or sell ourtransitional properties; or if lease terms upon renewal or re-letting are less favorable than current or historical lease terms; or if the values of properties that we sell are adversely affected by market conditions; or if we incur significantcosts or disruption related to or resulting from tenant financial distress, default or bankruptcy; then our cash flow could be significantly adversely affected. We are dependent on external sources of capital which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. We are dependent on external sources of capital to maintain our status as a REIT and must distribute to our shareholders eachyear at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding any net capital gain. Because of these distribution requirements, it is not likely that we will be able to fund all future capital needs, including acquisitions, from income from operations.Therefore, we will have to continue to rely on third-party sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash flows from operations, funds available under our $175.0 million senior securedrevolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with a group of commercial banks led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the Bank Syndicate) that matures in August 2015 and available cash and cash equivalents. OnFebruary 25, 2013, we entered into the Credit Agreement with the Bank Syndicate and a $100.0 million senior secured term loan agreement with the Prudential Insurance Company of America (the Prudential Loan Agreement), which maturesin February 2021. For additional information, please refer to Credit Agreement and Prudential Loan Agreement in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources which appears in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.   12 Table of ContentsEach of the Credit Agreement and the Prudential Loan Agreement contains customaryfinancial and other covenants such as loan to value, leverage and coverage ratios and minimum tangible net worth, as well as limitations on restricted payments, which may limit our ability to incur additional debt or pay dividends. The CreditAgreement contains customary events of default, including default under the Prudential Loan Agreement, change of control and failure to maintain REIT status. The Prudential Loan Agreement contains customary events of default, including default underthe Credit Agreement and failure to maintain REIT status. Our ability to meet the terms of the agreements is dependent on our continued ability to meet certain criteria as further described in note 4 in Item 8. Financial Statements andSupplementary Data  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the performance of our tenants and the other risks described in this section. If we are not in compliance with one or more of our covenants, which could result in an eventof default under our Credit Agreement or our Prudential Loan Agreement, there can be no assurance that our lenders would waive such non-compliance. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation,liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.  Our access to third-party sources of capital depends upon a number offactors including general market conditions, the markets perception of our growth potential, financial stability, our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions, covenants and limitations imposed under our Credit Agreementand Prudential Loan Agreement and the market price of our common stock.  We are repositioning our properties that were previouslyleased to Marketing. We expect to incur significant costs associated with repositioning these properties and we expect to generate less net revenue after leasing or selling these properties than previously received from Marketing. The incurrence ofthese costs and receipt of less net revenue may materially negatively impact our cash flow and ability to pay dividends. We are continuing to reposition the properties that were previously leased to Marketing pursuant to the Master Lease andexpect that we will sell and lease these properties over time. As of December 31, 2014, we had two groups of properties, which we consider transitional: (i) 46 properties, which are either subject to month-to-month license agreements, orwhich are vacant; and (ii) 121 properties, which are currently subject to two unitary triple-net leases that are in the process of being restructured. As of December 31, 2014, 26 of our transitional properties were subject to month-to-month license agreements allowing thelicensees (substantially all of whom were former tenants of Marketing) to occupy and use these properties as gas stations, convenience stores, automotive repair service facilities or other businesses. Under our month-to-month license agreements weare responsible for the payment of operating expenses such as maintenance, repairs and real estate taxes (Property Expenditures), certain environmental compliance costs and costs associated with any environmental remediation. In theaggregate, Property Expenditures and environmental costs exceed the licensing revenues we receive for transitional properties occupied under month-to-month license agreements. We will continue to be responsible for such Property Expenditures andenvironmental costs until these properties are sold or leased on a triple-net basis, and under certain leases and agreements thereafter. The incurrence of these expenses may materially negatively impact our cash flow and ability to pay dividends. Asof December 31, 2014, 20 of our transitional properties were vacant. We are responsible for the payment of all Property Expenditures, environmental compliance costs and costs associated with any environmental remediation until these propertiesare sold, or leased on a triple-net basis.  As of December 31, 2014, the 60 remaining properties subject to a unitarytriple-net lease with NECG continue to be transitional. Certain of the properties included in the NECG Lease were subject to eviction proceedings against former subtenants of Marketing who continued to occupy these properties after the terminationof the Master Lease. As of December 31, 2014, we have removed 24 of the original 84 properties from the NECG Lease and agreed to defer portions of rent due to us under the NECG Lease. We continue to be engaged in discussions with NECG aboutpotential modifications to the NECG Lease, which will likely include the removal of additional certain properties from the NECG Lease. Our discussions with NECG are ongoing and we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these discussions and theirimpact on the final size of the portfolio and future rental income associated with the NECG Lease. (For more information regarding NECG and the NECG Lease, see note 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.) In addition, as of December 31, 2014, we categorized as transitional 61 properties located in Southern New Jersey andEastern Pennsylvania, which are subject to the Ramoco Lease with Ramoco. We have entered into a lease modification agreement with Ramoco whereby we have agreed to defer portions of rent due to us under the Ramoco Lease. We are engaged in ongoingdiscussions with Ramoco about additional modifications to the Ramoco Lease, which we anticipate will include the removal of certain properties from the Ramoco Lease. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these discussions and their impact on thefinal size of the portfolio and future rental income associated with the Ramoco Lease. (For additional information regarding Ramoco and the Ramoco Lease, see note 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.) We continue to reposition our transitional properties and expect that we will sell, enter into new leases or modify existingleases on these properties over time. Although we are currently working on repositioning these transitional properties, the timing of pending or anticipated transactions may be affected by factors beyond our control and we cannot predict when or onwhat terms sales or leases will ultimately be consummated.   13 Table of ContentsWe are currently generating less net revenue from the leasing of thesetransitional properties and we expect that following the completion of the repositioning process, we will continue to generate less net revenue from the properties that were previously leased to Marketing than previously received from Marketing. Theincurrence of these costs and receipt of less net revenue from our properties that were subject to the Master Lease may materially negatively impact our cash flow and ability to pay dividends. In addition, it is possible that issues involved inre-letting or repositioning these properties may require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. We are continuing our efforts to sell certain properties. We cannot predict the terms or timing of any such property dispositions. If wedo not obtain favorable terms on such dispositions, our operations and financial performance may be negatively impacted. We are continuing our efforts to sell properties, including those properties which are accounted for as held for sale. Whilewe have dedicated considerable effort designed to increase sales activity, we cannot predict if or when property dispositions will close and whether the terms of any such disposition will be favorable to us. It is likely that we will retainenvironmental liabilities that exist with respect to that property or group of properties prior to the date of sale. If we do not obtain favorable terms on such dispositions, our operations and financial performance will be negatively impacted. We maintain significant pre-petition and post-petition unsecured claims against Marketing. We cannot provide any assurance that ourclaims will be accepted or paid.  As part of Marketings bankruptcy proceeding, we maintained significantpre-petition and post-petition unsecured claims against Marketing. On March 3, 2015, we entered into a settlement agreement (the Settlement Agreement) with the Liquidating Trustee of the Marketing Estate, which resolved the claimswe asserted in Marketings bankruptcy case in the Bankruptcy Court. The Settlement Agreement is subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court at a hearing that is scheduled to be held on April 7, 2015. Pursuant to the terms of theSettlement Agreement, we will receive an interim distribution from the Marketing Estate of approximately $6.0 million (the Interim Distribution) within 15 days of the approval of the Settlement Agreement by the Bankruptcy Court. Inaddition, if the Settlement Agreement is approved by the Bankruptcy Court, we expect to receive additional distributions from the Marketing Estate during 2015 on account of our claims. The Interim Distribution and any subsequent distributionsreceived by us from the Marketing Estate depend on our percentage of the total amount of allowed general unsecured claims against Marketing. The Liquidating Trustee and the Bankruptcy Court have not yet completed the process of determining the totalamount of allowed general unsecured claims against Marketing. We anticipate that the sum of all additional distributions will not materially exceed the amount of the Interim Distribution. We cannot provide any assurance as to whether the SettlementAgreement will be approved, or, if approved, the total amount of the distributions we will receive from the Marketing Estate on account of our claims or timing of such future distributions. Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial position and results of operations, andthey require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial position and results ofoperations. We have identified several accounting policies as being critical to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations because they require management to make particularly subjective or complex judgments about mattersthat are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be recorded under different conditions or using different assumptions. We cannot provide any assurance that we will not make subsequent significantadjustments to our consolidated financial statements. Estimates, judgments and assumptions underlying our consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, receivables and related reserves, deferred rent receivable, income underdirect financing leases, asset retirement obligations including environmental remediation obligations and future environmental liabilities for pre-existing unknown environmental contamination,, real estate, depreciation and amortization, carryingvalue of our properties, impairment of long-lived assets, litigation, accrued liabilities, income taxes and allocation of the purchase price of properties acquired to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If our accounting policies, methods, judgments, assumptions, estimates and allocations prove to be incorrect, or ifcircumstances change, our business, financial condition, revenues, operating expense, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price may be materially adversely affected. Our business operations may not generate sufficient cash for distributions or debt service. There is no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will beavailable to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay dividends on our common stock, to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may not be able to repay or refinance existing indebtedness on favorable terms, which couldforce us to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms (which may also result in losses) or accept financing on unfavorable terms.   14 Table of ContentsWe may acquire new properties, and this may create risks. We may acquire or develop properties when we believe that an acquisition or development matches our business and investmentstrategies. These properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential. It is possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline after we acquire them, they maynot perform as expected and, if financed by the Company using debt or new equity issuances, may result in shareholder dilution. Our acquisition of properties will expose us to the liabilities of those properties, some of which we may not be aware ofat the time of acquisition. We face competition in pursuing these acquisitions and we may not succeed in leasing acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover their costs of acquisition and operations. Newly acquired properties may require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoingbusiness. We may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions. Consequences arising from or in connection with any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity,ability to pay dividends or stock price.  We may not be able to successfully implement our investment strategy. We may not be able to successfully implement our investment strategy. We cannot assure you that our portfolio of propertieswill expand at all, or if it will expand at any specified rate or to any specified size. As part of our overall growth strategy, we regularly review acquisition and financing opportunities to invest in additional retail motor fuel and conveniencestore properties, and we expect to continue to pursue investments that we believe will benefit our financial performance. We cannot assure you that investment opportunities will be available which meet our investment criteria. Acquisitions ofproperties we acquire through the issuance of new equity securities may initially be dilutive to our net income, and such properties may not perform as we expect or produce the returns that we anticipate (including, without limitation, as a resultof tenant bankruptcies, tenant concessions, our inability to collect rents and higher than anticipated operating expenses). Further, we may not successfully integrate one or more of these property acquisitions into our existing portfolio withoutoperating disruptions or unanticipated costs. To the extent that our current sources of liquidity are not sufficient to fund such acquisitions, we will require other sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all.Additionally, to the extent we increase the size of our portfolio, we may not be able to adapt our management, administrative, accounting and operational systems, or hire and retain sufficient operational staff to integrate acquired properties intoour portfolio or manage any future acquisitions of properties without operating disruptions or unanticipated costs. Moreover, our continued growth will require increased investment in management personnel, professional fees, other personnel,financial and management systems and controls and facilities, which will result in additional operating expenses. Under the circumstances described above, our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects may be materially andadversely affected.  We are subject to risks inherent in owning and leasing real estate. We are subject to varying degrees of risk generally related to leasing and owning real estate many of which are beyond ourcontrol. In addition to general risks applicable to us, our risks include, among others:      our liability as a lessee for long-term lease obligations regardless of our revenues,     deterioration in national, regional and local economic and real estate market conditions,     potential changes in supply of, or demand for, rental properties similar to ours,     competition for tenants and declining rental rates,      difficulty in selling or re-letting properties on favorable terms or at all,     impairments in our ability to collect rent or other payments due to us when they are due,     increases in interest rates and adverse changes in the availability, cost and terms of financing,     uninsured property liability,      the impact of present or future environmental legislation and compliance with environmental laws,     adverse changes in zoning laws and other regulations,      acts of terrorism and war,      acts of God,      the potential risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time,     the need to periodically renovate and repair our properties, and     physical or weather-related damage to our properties.   15 Table of ContentsCertain significant expenditures generally do not change in response to economicor other conditions, including: (i) debt service, (ii) real estate taxes and (iii) operating and maintenance costs. The combination of variable revenue and relatively fixed expenditures may result, under certain market conditions, inreduced earnings and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.  Each of the factors listed above couldcause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. In addition, real estate investments are relatively illiquid, which means that our ability to vary ourportfolio of properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be limited.  Adverse developments in general business, economicor political conditions could have a material adverse effect on us.  Adverse developments in general business andeconomic conditions, including through recession, downturn or otherwise, either in the economy generally or in those regions in which a large portion of our business is conducted, could have a material adverse effect on us and significantly increasecertain of the risks we are subject to. Among other effects, adverse economic conditions could depress real estate values, impact our ability to re-let or sell our properties and have an adverse effect on our tenants level of sales andfinancial performance generally. Our revenues are dependent on the economic success of our tenants and any factors that adversely impact our tenants could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results ofoperations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.  Substantially all of our tenants depend on the same industry for their revenues. We derive substantially all of our revenues from leasing, primarily on a triple-net basis, and financing retailmotor fuel and convenience store properties to tenants in the petroleum marketing industry. Accordingly, our revenues are substantially dependent on the economic success of the petroleum marketing industry, and any factors that adversely affect thatindustry, such as disruption in the supply of petroleum or a decrease in the demand for conventional motor fuels due to conservation, technological advancements in petroleum-fueled motor vehicles or an increase in the use of alternative fuelvehicles, or green technology could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. The success of participants in the petroleum marketingindustry depends upon the sale of refined petroleum products at margins in excess of fixed and variable expenses. The petroleum marketing industry is highly competitive and volatile. Petroleum products are commodities, the prices of which depend onnumerous factors that affect supply and demand. The prices paid by our tenants and other petroleum marketers for products are affected by global, national and regional factors. A large, rapid increase in wholesale petroleum prices would adverselyaffect the profitability and cash flows of our tenants if the increased cost of petroleum products could not be passed on to their customers or if automobile consumption of gasoline was to decline significantly. We cannot be certain how thesefactors will affect petroleum product prices or supply in the future, or how in particular they will affect our tenants.  Property taxes on ourproperties may increase without notice.  Each of the properties we own or lease is subject to real property taxes.The leases for certain of the properties that we lease from third-parties obligate us to pay real property taxes with regard to those properties. The real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we acquire or lease in thefuture may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities. To the extent that our tenants are not responsible for property taxes pursuant to their contractual arrangements with us or areunable or unwilling to pay such increase in accordance with their leases, our net operating expenses may increase.  We are defending pendinglawsuits and claims and are subject to material losses.  We are subject to various lawsuits and claims, includinglitigation related to environmental matters, such as those arising from leaking USTs, contamination of groundwater with methyl tertiary butyl ether (a fuel derived from methanol, commonly referred to as MTBE) and releases of motor fuelinto the environment, and toxic tort claims. For example, we are currently involved in several proceedings described in Item 3. Legal Proceedings in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The ultimate resolution of certain matters cannot bepredicted because considerable uncertainty exists both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimate of such loss. Our ultimate liabilities resulting from the lawsuits and claims we face could cause a material adverse effect on our business,financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. For additional information with respect to pending environmental lawsuits and claims and environmental remediation obligations and estimates seeItem 3. Legal Proceedings and Environmental Matters in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and notes 3 and 5 in Item 8. Financial Statements andSupplementary Data  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.   16 Table of ContentsA significant portion of our properties are concentrated in the Northeast and Mid-Atlanticregions of the United States, and adverse conditions in those regions, in particular, could negatively impact our operations. A significant portion of the properties we own and lease are located in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the UnitedStates and approximately 60% of our properties are concentrated in three states (New York, Massachusetts and Connecticut). Because of the concentration of our properties in those regions, in the event of adverse economic conditions in those regions,we would likely experience higher risk of default on payment of rent to us than if our properties were more geographically diversified. Additionally, the rents on our properties may be subject to a greater risk of default than other properties inthe event of adverse economic, political or business developments or natural hazards that may affect the Northeast or Mid-Atlantic United States and the ability of our lessees to make rent payments. This lack of geographical diversification couldhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.  Weare in a competitive business.  The real estate industry is highly competitive. Where we own properties, wecompete for tenants with a large number of real estate property owners and other companies that sublet properties. Our principal means of competition are rents we are able to charge in relation to the income producing potential of the location. Inaddition, we expect other major real estate investors, some with much greater financial resources or more experienced personnel than we have, will compete with us for attractive acquisition opportunities. These competitors include petroleummanufacturing, distributing and marketing companies, other REITs, public and private investment funds and other individual and institutional investors. This competition has increased prices for properties we seek to acquire and may impair ourability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms in the future.  We are subject to losses that may not be covered by insurance. We, and certain of our tenants, carry insurance against certain risks and in such amounts as we believe arecustomary for businesses of our kind. However, as the costs and availability of insurance change, we may decide not to be covered against certain losses (such as certain environmental liabilities, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and civil disorder)where, in the judgment of management, the insurance is not warranted due to cost or availability of coverage or the remoteness of perceived risk. Furthermore, there are certain types of losses, such as losses resulting from wars, terrorism orcertain acts of God, that generally are not insured because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. There is no assurance that the existing insurance coverages are or will be sufficient to cover actual losses incurred. Thedestruction of, or significant damage to, or significant liabilities arising out of conditions at, our properties due to an uninsured loss would result in an economic loss and could result in us losing both our investment in, and anticipated profitsfrom, such properties. When a loss is insured, the coverage may be insufficient in amount or duration, or a lessees customers may be lost, such that the lessee cannot resume its business after the loss at prior levels or at all, resulting inreduced rent or a default under its lease. Any such loss relating to a large number of properties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. Failure to qualify as a REIT under the federal income tax laws would have adverse consequences to our shareholders. Uncertain taxmatters may have a significant impact on the results of operations for any single fiscal year or interim period or may cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT. We elected to be treated as a REIT under the federal income tax laws beginning January 1, 2001. To qualify for taxationas a REIT, we must, among other requirements such as those related to the composition of our assets and gross income, distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income, including taxable income that is accrued by us withouta corresponding receipt of cash. Accordingly, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on qualifying REIT income, provided that distributions to our shareholders equal at least the amount of our taxable income as defined under theInternal Revenue Code.  Many of the REIT requirements are highly technical and complex. If we were to fail to meet therequirements, or if the Internal Revenue Service were to successfully assert that our earnings and profits were greater than the amount distributed, we may be subject to federal income tax, excise taxes, penalties and interest or we may have to paya deficiency dividend to eliminate any earnings and profits that were not distributed. We may have to borrow money or sell assets to pay such a deficiency dividend. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to qualify in the future as a REIT. We cannot give any assurance that newlegislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the requirements relating to our qualification. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions toshareholders in computing our taxable income and will again be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates, we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax, we could be required to pay significant income taxes and we wouldhave less money available for our operations and distributions to shareholders. This would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities. We could also be precluded from treatment as a REIT for four taxable years followingthe year in which we lost the qualification, and all distributions to shareholders would be taxable as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Loss of our REIT status could have a materialadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.   17 Table of ContentsWe are exposed to interest rate risk and there can be no assurances that we will manage ormitigate this risk effectively.  We are exposed to interest rate risk, primarily as a result of our CreditAgreement. Borrowings under our Credit Agreement bear interest at a floating rate. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates will increase the amount of interest we must pay under our Credit Agreement. Our interest rate risk may materially changein the future if we increase our borrowings under the Credit Agreement, or amend our Credit Agreement or Prudential Loan Agreement, seek other sources of debt or equity capital or refinance our outstanding debt. A significant increase in interestrates could also make it more difficult to find alternative financing on desirable terms. (For additional information with respect to interest rate risk, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, asfiled with this Annual Report on Form 10-K.)  Future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our equity securities. Our future growth will depend upon our ability to raise additional capital. If we were to raise additionalcapital through the issuance of equity securities, we could dilute the interest of holders of our common stock. The interest of our common stockholders could also be diluted by the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to stock incentiveplans. Accordingly, the Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of equity securities that could dilute, or otherwise adversely affect, the interest of holders of our common stock. We may change our dividend policy and the dividends we pay may be subject to significant volatility. The decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future, as well as the timing, amount and composition ofany such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on such factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant. In addition, our Credit Agreement and our Prudential Loan Agreement prohibit the paymentsof dividends during certain events of default. No assurance can be given that our financial performance in the future will permit our payment of any dividends or that the amount of dividends we pay, if any, will not fluctuate significantly. Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, our ability to pay dividends would be restricted if, after payment of thedividend, (1) we would not be able to pay indebtedness as it becomes due in the usual course of business or (2) our total assets would be less than the sum of our liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if we were to bedissolved, to satisfy the rights of any shareholders with liquidation preferences. There currently are no shareholders with liquidation preferences. To qualify for taxation as a REIT, we must, among other requirements such as those related to the composition of our assetsand gross income, distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income, including taxable income that is accrued by us without a corresponding receipt of cash. We cannot provide any assurance that our cash flows will permit usto continue paying cash dividends.  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has allowed the use of a procedure, asa result of which we could satisfy the REIT income distribution requirement by making a distribution on our common stock comprised of (i) shares of our common stock having a value of up to 80% of the total distribution and (ii) cash in theremaining amount of the total distribution, in lieu of paying the distribution entirely in cash. In January 2015, we received a private letter ruling from the IRS that allows us to make a distribution on our common stock comprised of (i) sharesof our common stock having a value of up to 80% of the total distribution and (ii) cash in the remaining amount of the total distribution, in lieu of paying the distribution entirely in cash. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K,we are not planning to make a distribution using our common stock.  It is also possible that instead of distributing 100%of our taxable income on an annual basis, we may decide to retain a portion of our taxable income and to pay taxes on such amounts as permitted by the IRS. In the event that we pay a portion of a dividend in shares of our common stock, taxable U.S.shareholders would be required to pay tax on the entire amount of the dividend, including the portion paid in shares of common stock, in which case such shareholders might have to pay the tax using cash from other sources. If a U.S. shareholdersells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our common stock at the time of the sale.Furthermore, with respect to non-U.S. shareholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such dividend, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock. In addition, if a significant number ofour shareholders sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, such sales would put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock. As a result of the factors described herein and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and those that are described fromtime to time in our other filings with the SEC, we may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, revenues, operatingexpenses, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or our stock price.   18 Table of ContentsChanges in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded common stock. As with other publicly traded securities, the market price of our publicly traded common stock depends on variousmarket conditions, which may change from time-to-time. Among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded common stock are the following:      our financial condition and performance and that of our significant tenants,     the markets perception of our growth potential and potential future earnings,     the reputation of REITs generally and the reputation of REITs with portfolios similar to us,     the attractiveness of the securities of REITs in comparison to securities issued by other entities (including securities issued by other realestate companies),      an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid forpublicly traded securities,      the extent of institutional investor interest in us, and     general economic and financial market conditions. In order to preserve our REIT status, our charter limits the number of shares a person may own, which may discourage a takeover thatcould result in a premium price for our common stock or otherwise benefit our stockholders.  Our charter, withcertain exceptions, authorizes our Board of Directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Unless exempted by our Board of Directors, no person may actually orconstructively own more than 5% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding shares of our common stock or the outstanding shares of any class or series of our preferred stock, which may inhibit large investorsfrom desiring to purchase our stock. This restriction may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all of ourassets) that might provide a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders.  Maryland law maydiscourage a third-party from acquiring us.  We are subject to the provisions of the Maryland Business CombinationAct (the Business Combination Act) which prohibits transactions between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interestedstockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Generally, pursuant to the Business Combination Act, an interested stockholder is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10% ormore of a Maryland corporations voting stock. These provisions could have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of our Company or reducing the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future forshares of our capital stock. Additionally, the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act may deny voting rights to shares involved in an acquisition of one-tenth or more of the voting stock of a Maryland corporation. In our charter and bylaws, we haveelected not to have the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act apply to any acquisition by any person of shares of stock of our Company. However, in the case of the control share acquisition statute, our Board of Directors may opt to make thisstatute applicable to us at any time by amending our bylaws, and may do so on a retroactive basis. Finally, the unsolicited takeovers provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law permit our Board of Directors, without stockholderapproval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to implement certain provisions that may have the effect of inhibiting a third-party from making an acquisition proposal for our Company or of delaying, deferring orpreventing a change in control of our Company under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price or that stockholders may otherwise believe isin their best interests.  Inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Although inflation has not materially impacted our results of operations in the recent past, increased inflation could have amore pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations. During times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, as provided for in our leases, rent increases may not keep up with therate of inflation. Likewise, even though our triple-net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation, substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in theiroperating expenses exceed increases in revenue, which may adversely affect our tenants ability to pay rent.   19 Table of ContentsThe loss of certain members of our management team could adversely affect our business. Our future success and ability to implement our business and investment strategy depends, in part, on our ability to attractand retain key management personnel and on the continued contributions of members of our senior management team, each of whom would be difficult to replace. As a REIT, we employ only 32 employees and have a cost-effective management structure.Except for the employment agreement with our President and Chief Executive Officer, David B. Driscoll, we do not have employment agreements with any of our executives. In the event of the loss of key management personnel, or upon unexpected death,disability or retirement, we may not be able to find replacements with comparable skill, ability and industry expertise which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to paydividends or stock price.  Amendments to the Accounting Standards Codification made by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (theFASB) or changes in accounting standards issued by other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability or financial position. Our consolidated financial statements are subject to the application of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles(GAAP) in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification, which is periodically amended by the FASB. The application of GAAP is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, we are required to adopt amendments tothe Accounting Standards Codification or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time-to-time by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB and the SEC. Those changes could adversely affect our reported revenues,profitability or financial position.  Our assets may be subject to impairment charges. We periodically evaluate our real estate investments and other assets for impairment indicators. The judgment regarding theexistence of impairment indicators is based on GAAP, and includes a variety of factors such as market conditions, the accumulation of asset retirement costs as a result of increases in estimated environmental liabilities, the status of significantleases, the financial condition of major tenants and other assumptions and factors that could affect the cash flow from or fair value of our properties. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we incurred $21.5 million and $13.4million, respectively, of non-cash impairment charges. We may be required to take similar non-cash impairment charges, which could affect the implementation of our current business strategy and have a material adverse effect on our financialcondition and results of operations.  Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the market on which our commonstock trades, the markets in which we operate, our operations and our results of operations.  Terrorist attacks orother acts of violence or war could affect our business or the businesses of our tenants. The consequences of armed conflicts are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. Moregenerally, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States and worldwide financial markets and economy. Terrorist attacks also could be a factor resulting in, or acontinuation of, an economic recession in the United States or abroad. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. We rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of thattechnology could harm our business.  We rely on information technology networks and systems, including theInternet, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, including financial transactions and maintenance of records, which may include personal identifying information of tenantsand lease data. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting and storing confidential tenant information, such as individually identifiable information relating tofinancial accounts. Although we have taken steps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems, it is possible that our security measures will not be able to prevent the systems improper functioning, or the improperdisclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber attacks. Security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions,shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims orregulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect us"
5,GTY,GETTY REALTY CORP,2014-03-17,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
 We are subject to various risks, many of which are beyond our control. As a result of these and other factors, we may experience materialfluctuations in our future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. An investment inour stock involves various risks, including those mentioned below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and those that are described from time to time in our other filings with the SEC. Our future cash flow is dependent on the performance of our tenants of their lease obligations, renewal of existing leases and either re-letting orselling our transitional properties.  We are subject to risks that financial distress, default or bankruptcy of our tenants maylead to vacancy at our properties or disruption in rent receipts as a result of partial payment or nonpayment of rent or that expiring leases may not be renewed. Under unfavorable general economic conditions, there can be no assurance that ourtenants level of sales and financial performance generally will not be adversely affected, which in turn, could impact the reliability of our rent receipts. We are subject to risks that the terms governing renewal or re-letting of ourproperties (including the cost of required renovations, replacement of underground storage tanks and related equipment or environmental remediation) may be less favorable than current lease terms (or prior lease terms in the case of vacantproperties). We are also subject to the risk that we may receive less net proceeds from the properties we sell as compared to their current carrying value or that the value of our properties may be adversely affected by unfavorable general economicconditions. Unfavorable general economic conditions may also negatively impact our ability to re-let or sell our properties. Numerous properties compete with our properties in attracting tenants to lease space. The number of available or competitiveproperties in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease or sell our properties and on the rents we are able to charge. In addition to the risk of disruption in rent receipts, we are subject to the risk ofincurring real estate taxes, maintenance, environmental and other expenses at vacant properties.   9 Table of ContentsThe financial distress, default or bankruptcy of our tenants may also lead to protracted andexpensive processes for retaking control of our properties than would otherwise be the case, including, eviction or other legal proceedings related to or resulting from the tenants default. These risks are greater with respect to certain ofour tenants who lease multiple properties from us. If a tenant files for bankruptcy protection it is possible that we would recover substantially less than the full value of our claims against the tenant. If our tenants do not perform their leaseobligations; or we are unable to renew existing leases and promptly recapture and re-let or sell vacant locations; or if lease terms upon renewal or re-letting are less favorable than current lease terms; or if the values of properties that we sellare adversely affected by market conditions; or if we incur significant costs or disruption related to or resulting from tenant financial distress, default or bankruptcy; then our cash flow could be significantly adversely affected. We incur significant operating costs as a result of environmental laws and regulations which costs could significantly rise and reduce ourprofitability.  We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, including matters relating to theprotection of the environment. Under certain environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum productsat, on, or under, such property, and may be required to investigate and clean-up such contamination. Such laws typically impose liability and clean-up responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence ofthe contaminants, or the timing or cause of the contamination, and the liability under such laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility. For example,liability may arise as a result of the historical use of a property or from the migration of contamination from adjacent or nearby properties. Any such contamination or liability may also reduce the value of the property. In addition, the owner oroperator of a property may be subject to claims by third-parties based on injury, damage and/or costs, including investigation and clean-up costs, resulting from environmental contamination present at or emanating from a property. The propertiesowned or controlled by us are leased primarily as retail motor fuel and convenience store properties, and therefore may contain, or may have contained, USTs for the storage of petroleum products and other hazardous or toxic substances, which createsa potential for the release of such products or substances. Some of our properties may be subject to regulations regarding the retirement and decommissioning or removal of long-lived assets including buildings containing hazardous materials, USTsand other equipment. Some of the properties may be adjacent to or near properties that have contained or currently contain USTs used to store petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, certain of the properties are on,adjacent to, or near properties upon which others have engaged or may in the future engage in activities that may release petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. There may be other environmental problems associated with ourproperties of which we are unaware. These problems may make it more difficult for us to re-let or sell our properties on favorable terms, or at all. For additional information with respect to pending environmental lawsuits and claims, and environmental remediation obligations and estimatessee Item 3. Legal Proceedings, Environmental Matters in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and notes 3 and 5 in Item 8. Financial Statementsand Supplementary Data  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We enter into leasesand various other agreements which allocate between the parties responsibility for known and unknown environmental liabilities at or relating to the subject premises. We are contingently liable for these environmental obligations in the event thatthe counterparty to the agreement does not satisfy them.  For all of our triple-net leases, our tenants are directly responsiblefor compliance with various environmental laws and regulations as the operators of our properties, for the retirement and decommissioning or removal of all or a negotiated percentage of USTs and other equipment and for remediation ofenvironmental contamination that arises during the term of their tenancy. Under the terms of our leases covering properties previously leased to Marketing, we have agreed to be responsible for environmental contamination at the premises that isknown at the time the lease commences and for contamination that existed at the premises prior to commencement of the lease and is discovered by the tenant (other than as a result of a voluntary site investigation) during the first ten years of thelease term. After the expiration of such ten year period, responsibility for all newly discovered contamination (irrespective of when the contamination first arose) is allocated to our tenant. Under most of our other triple-net leases,responsibility for remediation of all environmental contamination discovered during the term of the lease (including known and unknown contamination that existed prior to commencement of the lease) is the responsibility of our tenant. Environmental remediation obligations are initially measured at fair value based on their expected future net cash flows which have beenadjusted for inflation and discounted to present value. We adjust our environmental remediation liability quarterly to reflect changes in projected expenditures, accretion and reductions associated with actual expenditures incurred during eachquarter. As of December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we had accrued $43.5 million, $46.2 million and $57.7 million, respectively, as our best estimate of the fair value of reasonably estimable environmental remediation obligations net of estimatedrecoveries and obligations to remove USTs. Environmental liabilities are accreted for the change in present value due to the passage of time and, accordingly, $3.2 million, $3.2 million and $0.9 million of net accretion expense was recorded for theyears ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, which is included in environmental expenses. In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we recorded credits to environmental expenses included in continuingoperations and to earnings from operating activities in discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations aggregating $3.0 million and $4.2 million, respectively, where decreases in estimated remediation costs exceeded thedepreciated carrying value of previously capitalized asset retirement costs. Environmental expenses also include project management fees, legal fees and provisions for environmental litigation losses.   10 Table of ContentsEnvironmental exposures are difficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons, including theextent of contamination, alternative treatment methods that may be applied, location of the property which subjects it to differing local laws and regulations and their interpretations, as well as the time it takes to remediate contamination. Indeveloping our liability for estimated environmental remediation obligations on a property by property basis, we consider among other things, enacted laws and regulations, assessments of contamination and surrounding geology, quality of informationavailable, currently available technologies for treatment, alternative methods of remediation and prior experience. Environmental accruals are based on estimates which are subject to significant change, and are adjusted as the remediation treatmentprogresses, as circumstances change and as environmental contingencies become more clearly defined and reasonably estimable. Adjustments to accrued liabilities for environmental remediation obligations will be reflected in our consolidated financialstatements as they become probable and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.  It is possible that our assumptions regarding theultimate allocation methods and share of responsibility that we used to allocate environmental liabilities may change, which may result in adjustments to the amounts recorded for environmental litigation accruals and environmental remediationliabilities. We will be required to accrue for environmental liabilities that we believe are allocable to others under various other agreements if we determine that it is probable that the counterparty will not meet its environmental obligations. Wemay ultimately be responsible to pay for environmental liabilities as the property owner if the counterparty fails to pay them.  We cannotpredict what environmental legislation or regulations may be enacted in the future, or how existing laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted with respect to products or activities to which they have not previously been applied. Wecannot predict if state UST fund programs will be administered and funded in the future in a manner that is consistent with past practices and if future environmental spending will continue to be eligible for reimbursement at historical recoveryrates under these programs. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of the regulatory agencies or stricter interpretation of existing laws, which may develop in the future, could have anadverse effect on our financial position, or that of our tenants, and could require substantial additional expenditures for future remediation. As a result of the factors discussed above, or others, compliance with environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effecton our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.  We are dependent on externalsources of capital which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.  We are dependent on external sources of capital tomaintain our status as a REIT and must distribute to our shareholders each year at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding any net capital gain. Because of these distribution requirements, it is not likely that we will be able to fund allfuture capital needs, including acquisitions, from income from operations. Therefore, we will have to continue to rely on third-party sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash flows from operations, funds available under our Credit Agreement that matures in August 2015and available cash and cash equivalents. On February 25, 2013, we entered into a $175.0 million senior secured revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with a group of commercial banks led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (theBank Syndicate), which is scheduled to mature in August 2015 and a $100.0 million senior secured term loan agreement with the Prudential Insurance Company of America (the Prudential Loan Agreement), which matures in February2021. On February 25, 2013, we also repaid and terminated our existing credit agreement with a group of commercial banks led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and our term loan agreement with TD Bank. For additional information, please refer toCredit Agreement and Prudential Loan Agreement in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources which appears in thisAnnual Report on Form 10-K.  Each of the Credit Agreement and the Prudential Loan Agreement contains customary financial and othercovenants such as loan to value, leverage and coverage ratios and minimum tangible net worth, as well as limitations on restricted payments, which may limit our ability to incur additional debt or pay dividends. The Credit Agreement containscustomary events of default, including default under the Prudential Loan Agreement, change of control and failure to maintain REIT status. The Prudential Loan Agreement contains customary events of default, including default under the CreditAgreement and failure to maintain REIT status. Our ability to meet these is dependent on our continued ability to meet certain criteria as further described in note 4 in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Notes toConsolidated Financial Statements and the performance of our tenants. If we are not in compliance with one or more of our covenants, which could result in an event of default under our Credit Agreement or our Prudential Loan Agreement, therecan be no assurance that our lenders would waive such non-compliance. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. Our access to third-party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors including general market conditions, the marketsperception of our growth potential, financial stability, our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions, covenants and limitations imposed under our Credit Agreement and our Prudential Loan Agreement and the market price of ourcommon stock.   11 Table of ContentsWe are exposed to counterparty risk and there can be no assurances that we will effectively manage ormitigate this risk.  We regularly interact with counterparties in various industries. The types of counterparties most common toour transactions and agreements include, but are not limited to, landlords, tenants, vendors and lenders. We also enter into agreements to acquire and sell properties which allocate responsibility for certain costs to the counterparty. Our mostsignificant counterparties include, but are not limited to the members of the Bank Syndicate related to our Credit Agreement, the lender that is the counterparty to the Prudential Loan Agreement and two of our major tenants from whom we derive asignificant amount of rental revenue. The default, insolvency or other inability of a significant counterparty to perform its obligations under an agreement or transaction, including, without limitation, as a result of the rejection of an agreementor transaction in bankruptcy proceedings, is likely to have a material adverse effect on us. As of December 31, 2013, we leased 142 gasoline station and convenience store properties in two separate unitary leases to subsidiaries of ChestnutPetroleum Dist., CPD NY Energy Corp. (CPD NY) and NECG Holdings Corp. (NECG). We lease 58 properties to CPD NY and 84 properties to NECG. CPD NY and NECG together represented 21%, 18% and 12% of our rental revenues for theyears ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. It is possible that as a result of either acquiring additional properties from Chestnut Petroleum Dist. or as a result of disposing some of our existing properties, Chestnut PetroleumDist. could account for a greater percentage of our rental revenues. In addition, as of December 31, 2013, we leased 97 gasoline station and convenience store properties in four separate unitary leases to subsidiaries of Capitol PetroleumGroup, LLC (Capitol). We lease 37 properties to White Oak Petroleum, LLC, 24 properties to Hudson Petroleum Realty, LLC, 20 properties to Dogwood Petroleum Realty, LLC and 16 properties to Big Apple Petroleum Realty, LLC. In aggregate,these Capitol affiliates represented 15%, 7% and 6% of our rental revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. It is possible that as a result of either acquiring additional properties from Capitol or as a resultof disposing some of our existing properties, Capitol could account for a greater percentage of our rental revenues. We may also undertake additional transactions with our other existing tenants which would further concentrate our sources ofrevenues. Although we have separate, non-cross defaulted leases with each of these subsidiaries, because such subsidiaries are affiliated with one another and under common control, a material adverse impact on one subsidiary, or failure of suchsubsidiary to perform its rental and other obligations to us, may contribute to a material adverse impact on the other subsidiaries and/or failure of the other subsidiaries to perform its rental and other obligations to us. The failure of a majortenant or their default in their rental and other obligations to us is likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. We are repositioning our properties that were previously leased to Marketing. We expect to incur significant costs associated with repositioning theseproperties and we expect to generate less net revenue after leasing or selling these properties than previously received from Marketing. The incurrence of these costs and receipt of less net revenue may materially negatively impact our cash flow andability to pay dividends.  We are continuing to reposition the properties that were previously leased to Getty Petroleum MarketingInc. (Marketing) pursuant to a master lease (the Master Lease) and expect that we will sell and lease these properties over time. As of December 31, 2013, we had 210 transitional properties in our portfolio. Ninety ofthese properties are subject to month-to-month license agreements allowing the licensees (substantially all of whom were Marketings former subtenants) to pay us a licensing fee to occupy and use these properties as gas stations, conveniencestores, automotive repair service facilities or other businesses. As of December 31, 2013, we also categorized the 84 properties subject to a lease with NECG Holdings Corp (NECG or the NECG Lease as appropriate) astransitional. Some of the properties included in the NECG Lease remain subject to eviction proceedings against Marketings former subtenants (or sub-subtenants) who continue to occupy these properties. These ongoing eviction proceedings havematerially adversely impacted NECG. (For more information regarding NECG and the NECG Lease, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements). Finally, thirty six transitional properties were vacant as of December 31, 2013. We continue toreposition these properties and expect that we will sell, enter into new leases or modify existing leases on these transitional properties over time. Although we are currently working on repositioning these transitional properties, the timing ofpending or anticipated transactions may be affected by factors beyond our control and we cannot predict when or on what terms sales or leases will ultimately be consummated. In the aggregate, Property Expenditures and environmental costs exceed licensing revenues for transitional properties occupied undermonth-to-month license agreements, or which are vacant. We will continue to be responsible for such Property Expenditures until these properties are sold or leased on a triple-net basis. For the quarter and year ended December 31, 2013, weincurred $1.7 million and $8.3 million, respectively, of Property Expenditures related to these transitional properties. In addition, in connection with the repositioning of properties previously leased to Marketing, we have increased the number ofour tenants significantly, and we are performing property related functions previously performed by Marketing, both of which have resulted in increases in our annual operating expenses. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are pursuing evictions on 18 of our transitional properties. The most significanteviction action is against a group of former Marketing subtenants (or sub-subtenants) who continue to occupy certain properties in the State of Connecticut which are subject to the NECG Lease. These ongoing eviction proceedings have materiallyadversely impacted NECG. In June 2013, the Connecticut Superior Court ruled in our favor with respect to all 24 locations involved in the proceedings. However, in July 2013, the operators against whom these Superior Court rulings were made appealedthe decisions. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, 13 of the original 24 operators against whom eviction proceedings were brought have reached agreements with NECG to either remain in the properties as bona fide subtenants or vacatethe premises, and have withdrawn their appeals. Eleven of the operators remain in occupancy of the subject sites during the pendency of their appeal. We remain confident that we will prevail in the remaining appeals and, although no assurances canbe given, we anticipate a favorable resolution of this matter in 2014. We expect that we will enter into a restructuring of the NECG Lease after a final resolution to the eviction proceedings is determined.   12 Table of ContentsIn addition to the Connecticut evictions, we are pursuing eviction proceedings involving seven ofour other properties in various jurisdictions against Marketings former subtenants who have not vacated our properties and most of whom have not entered into license agreements with us or have not entered into new agreements with ourdistributor tenants and therefore occupy our properties without right. We are incurring significant costs, primarily legal expenses, in connection with such proceedings. We are currently generating less net revenue from the leasing of these transitional properties and we expect that following the completion ofthe repositioning process, we will continue to generate less net revenue from the properties that were previously leased to Marketing than previously received from Marketing. The incurrence of these costs and receipt of less net revenue from ourproperties that were subject to the Master Lease may materially negatively impact our cash flow and ability to pay dividends. In addition, it is possible that issues involved in re-letting or repositioning these properties may require significantmanagement attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business.  We are continuing our efforts to sell certain properties. We cannotpredict the terms or timing of any such property dispositions. If we do not obtain favorable terms on such dispositions, our operations and financial performance may be negatively impacted. We are continuing our efforts to sell properties, including those properties which are accounted for as held for sale. While we have dedicatedconsiderable effort designed to increase sales activity, we cannot predict if or when property dispositions will close and whether the terms of any such disposition will be favorable to us. It is likely that we will retain environmental liabilitiesthat exist with respect to that property or group of properties prior to the date of sale, to the extent there is no third-party responsible therefor. If we do not obtain favorable terms on such dispositions, our operations and financial performancewill be negatively impacted.  We maintain significant pre-petition and post-petition claims against Marketing. We cannot provide any assurance thatour claims will be accepted or paid.  As part of Marketings bankruptcy proceeding, we maintain significant pre-petition andpost-petition claims against Marketing. We believe that we will receive additional distributions from the Marketing Estate to satisfy our remaining general unsecured claims. We cannot provide any assurance as to our proportionate interest in anyMarketing Estate assets, or the amount or timing of recoveries, if any, with respect to our remaining general unsecured claims against the Marketing Estate. Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial position and results of operations, and they requiremanagement to make estimates, judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain.  Our accounting policies andmethods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial position and results of operations. We have identified several accounting policies as being critical to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations becausethey require management to make particularly subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be recorded under different conditions or using differentassumptions. We cannot provide any assurance that we will not make subsequent significant adjustments to our consolidated financial statements. Estimates, judgments and assumptions underlying our consolidated financial statements include, but arenot limited to, receivables and related reserves, deferred rent receivable, income under direct financing leases, asset retirement obligations including environmental remediation obligations, real estate, depreciation and amortization, impairment oflong-lived assets, litigation, accrued liabilities, income taxes and allocation of the purchase price of properties acquired to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If our accounting policies, methods, judgments, assumptions and allocations prove to be incorrect, or if circumstances change, our business,financial condition, revenues, operating expense, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price may be materially adversely affected. Our business operations may not generate sufficient cash for distributions or debt service. There is no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us inan amount sufficient to enable us to pay dividends on our common stock, to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may not be able to repay or refinance existing indebtedness on favorable terms, which could force us to disposeof properties on disadvantageous terms (which may also result in losses) or accept financing on unfavorable terms.  We may acquire new properties,and this may create risks.  We may acquire or develop properties when we believe that an acquisition or development matches ourbusiness strategies. These properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential. It is possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline after we acquire them,they may not perform as expected and, if financed using debt or new equity issuances, may result in shareholder dilution. Our acquisition of properties will expose us to the liabilities of those properties, some of which we may not be aware of atthe time of acquisition. We face competition in pursuing these acquisitions and we may not succeed in leasing acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover their costs of acquisition and operations.  13 Table of ContentsNewly acquired properties may require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. We may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions.Consequences arising from or in connection with any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. We may not be able to successfully implement our investment strategy. We may not be able to successfully implement our investment strategy. We cannot assure you that our portfolio of properties will expand at all,or if it will expand at any specified rate or to any specified size. As part of our overall growth strategy, we regularly review acquisition and financing opportunities to invest in additional retail motor fuel and convenience store properties, andwe expect to continue to pursue investments that we believe will benefit our financial performance. We cannot assure you that investment opportunities will be available which meet our investment criteria. Acquisitions of properties we acquire mayinitially be dilutive to our net income, and such properties may not perform as we expect or produce the returns that we anticipate (including, without limitation, as a result of tenant bankruptcies, tenant concessions, our inability to collectrents and higher than anticipated operating expenses). Further, we may not successfully integrate one or more of these property acquisitions into our existing portfolio without operating disruptions or unanticipated costs. To the extent that ourcurrent sources of liquidity are not sufficient to fund such acquisitions, we will require other sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Additionally, to the extent we increase the size of our portfolio,we may not be able to adapt our management, administrative, accounting and operational systems, or hire and retain sufficient operational staff to integrate acquired properties into our portfolio or manage any future acquisitions of propertieswithout operating disruptions or unanticipated costs. Moreover, our continued growth will require increased investment in management personnel, professional fees, other personnel, financial and management systems and controls and facilities, whichwill result in additional operating expenses. Under the circumstances described above, our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects may be materially and adversely affected. We are subject to risks inherent in owning and leasing real estate. We are subject to varying degrees of risk generally related to leasing and owning real estate many of which are beyond our control. In additionto general risks applicable to us, our risks include, among others:     our liability as a lessee for long-term lease obligations regardless of our revenues,     deterioration in national, regional and local economic and real estate market conditions,     potential changes in supply of, or demand for, rental properties similar to ours,     competition for tenants and declining rental rates,     difficulty in selling or re-letting properties on favorable terms or at all,     impairments in our ability to collect rent or other payments due to us when they are due,     increases in interest rates and adverse changes in the availability, cost and terms of financing,     uninsured property liability,     the impact of present or future environmental legislation and compliance with environmental laws,     adverse changes in zoning laws and other regulations,     acts of terrorism and war,     acts of God,     the potential risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time,     the need to periodically renovate and repair our properties, and     physical or weather-related damage to our properties.  Certain significant expendituresgenerally do not change in response to economic or other conditions, including: (i) debt service, (ii) real estate taxes and (iii) operating and maintenance costs. The combination of variable revenue and relatively fixed expendituresmay result, under certain market conditions, in reduced earnings and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.   14 Table of ContentsEach of the factors listed above could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. In addition, real estate investments are relatively illiquid, which means that our ability to vary our portfolio of properties in response to changes in economicand other conditions may be limited.  Adverse developments in general business, economic or political conditions could have a material adverseeffect on us.  Adverse developments in general business and economic conditions, including through recession, downturn orotherwise, either in the economy generally or in those regions in which a large portion of our business is conducted, could have a material adverse effect on us and significantly increase certain of the risks we are subject to. The general economicconditions in the United States are, and for an extended period of time may be, significantly less favorable than that of prior years. Among other effects, adverse economic conditions could depress real estate values, impact our ability to re-let orsell our properties and have an adverse effect on our tenants level of sales and financial performance generally. Our revenues are dependent on the economic success of our tenants and any factors that adversely impact our tenants could alsohave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. Substantially all of our tenants depend on the same industry for their revenues. We derive substantially all of our revenues from leasing, primarily on a triple-net basis, and financing retail motor fuel and conveniencestore properties to tenants in the petroleum marketing industry. Accordingly, our revenues are substantially dependent on the economic success of the petroleum marketing industry, and any factors that adversely affect that industry, such asdisruption in the supply of petroleum or a decrease in the demand for conventional motor fuels due to conservation, technological advancements in petroleum-fueled motor vehicles or an increase in the use of alternative fuel vehicles, or greentechnology could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. The success of participants in the petroleum marketing industry dependsupon the sale of refined petroleum products at margins in excess of fixed and variable expenses. The petroleum marketing industry is highly competitive and volatile. Petroleum products are commodities, the prices of which depend on numerous factorsthat affect supply and demand. The prices paid by our tenants and other petroleum marketers for products are affected by global, national and regional factors. A large, rapid increase in wholesale petroleum prices would adversely affect theprofitability and cash flows of our tenants if the increased cost of petroleum products could not be passed on to their customers or if automobile consumption of gasoline was to decline significantly. We cannot be certain how these factors willaffect petroleum product prices or supply in the future, or how in particular they will affect our tenants.  Property taxes on our properties mayincrease without notice.  Each of the properties we own or lease is subject to real property taxes. The leases for certain of theproperties that we lease from third-parties obligate us to pay real property taxes with regard to those properties. The real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we acquire or lease in the future may increase as propertytax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities. To the extent that our tenants are not responsible for property taxes pursuant to their contractual arrangements with us or are unable or unwilling to pay suchincrease in accordance with their leases, our net operating expenses may increase.  We are defending pending lawsuits and claims and are subject tomaterial losses.  We are subject to various lawsuits and claims, including litigation related to environmental matters, such asthose arising from leaking USTs, contamination of groundwater with methyl tertiary butyl ether (a fuel derived from methanol, commonly referred to as MTBE) and releases of motor fuel into the environment, and toxic tort claims. Forexample, we are currently involved in several proceedings described in Item 3. Legal Proceedings in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The ultimate resolution of certain matters cannot be predicted because considerable uncertainty existsboth in terms of the probability of loss and the estimate of such loss. Our ultimate liabilities resulting from the lawsuits and claims we face could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations,liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. For additional information with respect to pending environmental lawsuits and claims and environmental remediation obligations and estimates see Item 3. Legal Proceedings andEnvironmental Matters in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and notes 3 and 5 in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Notes toConsolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  A significant portion of our properties are concentrated in theNortheast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, and adverse conditions in those regions, in particular, could negatively impact our operations. A significant portion of the properties we own and lease are located in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States andapproximately 60% of our properties are concentrated in three states (New York, Massachusetts and Connecticut). Because of the concentration of our properties in those regions, in the event of adverse economic conditions in those regions, we wouldlikely experience higher risk of default on payment of rent to us than if our properties were more geographically diversified. Additionally, the rents on our properties may be subject to a greater risk of default than other properties in the eventof adverse economic, political   15 Table of Contentsor business developments or natural hazards that may affect the Northeast or Mid-Atlantic United States and the ability of our lessees to make rent payments. This lack of geographicaldiversification could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. We are in a competitive business. The real estate industry is highly competitive. Where we own properties, we compete for tenants with a large number of real estate propertyowners and other companies that sublet properties. Our principal means of competition are rents we are able to charge in relation to the income producing potential of the location. In addition, we expect other major real estate investors, some withmuch greater financial resources or more experienced personnel than we have, will compete with us for attractive acquisition opportunities. These competitors include petroleum manufacturing, distributing and marketing companies, other REITs, publicand private investment funds and other individual and institutional investors. This competition has increased prices for properties we seek to acquire and may impair our ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms in thefuture.  Because our tenants are not rated and their financial information is not available to you, it may be difficult for our investors todetermine their creditworthiness.  The majority of our properties are leased to tenants who are not rated by any nationallyrecognized statistical rating organization. In addition, our tenants financial information is not generally available to our investors. It is, therefore, difficult for our investors to assess the creditworthiness of our tenants and todetermine the ability of a tenant to meet its obligations to us. It is possible that we may be required to increase reserves for bad debts, record allowances for deferred rent receivable or record additional expenses if our tenants are unable tomeet their obligations to us.  We are subject to losses that may not be covered by insurance. We, and certain of our tenants, carry insurance against certain risks and in such amounts as we believe are customary for businesses of ourkind. However, as the costs and availability of insurance change, we may decide not to be covered against certain losses (such as certain environmental liabilities, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and civil disorder) where, in the judgment ofmanagement, the insurance is not warranted due to cost or availability of coverage or the remoteness of perceived risk. Furthermore, there are certain types of losses, such as losses resulting from wars, terrorism or certain acts of God, thatgenerally are not insured because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. There is no assurance that the existing insurance coverages are or will be sufficient to cover actual losses incurred. The destruction of, or significantdamage to, or significant liabilities arising out of conditions at, our properties due to an uninsured cause would result in an economic loss and could result in us losing both our investment in, and anticipated profits from, such properties. When aloss is insured, the coverage may be insufficient in amount or duration, or a lessees customers may be lost, such that the lessee cannot resume its business after the loss at prior levels or at all, resulting in reduced rent or a default underits lease. Any such loss relating to a large number of properties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. Failure to qualify as a REIT under the federal income tax laws would have adverse consequences to our shareholders. Uncertain tax matters may have asignificant impact on the results of operations for any single fiscal year or interim period or may cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT. We elected to be treated as a REIT under the federal income tax laws beginning January 1, 2001. To qualify for taxation as a REIT, wemust, among other requirements such as those related to the composition of our assets and gross income, distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income, including taxable income that is accrued by us without acorresponding receipt of cash. Accordingly, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on qualifying REIT income, provided that distributions to our shareholders equal at least the amount of our taxable income as defined under theInternal Revenue Code.  Many of the REIT requirements are highly technical and complex. If we were to fail to meet the requirements, or ifthe Internal Revenue Service were to successfully assert that our earnings and profits were greater than the amount distributed, we may be subject to federal income tax, excise taxes, penalties and interest or we may have to pay a deficiencydividend to eliminate any earnings and profits that were not distributed. We may have to borrow money or sell assets to pay such a deficiency dividend. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to qualify in the future as a REIT. We cannot give any assurance that new legislation, regulations,administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the requirements relating to our qualification. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing ourtaxable income and will again be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates, we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax, we could be required to pay significant income taxes and we would have less money available forour operations and distributions to shareholders. This would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities. We could also be precluded from treatment as a REIT for four taxable years following the year in which we lost thequalification, and all distributions to shareholders would be taxable as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Loss of our REIT status could have a material adverse effect on our business,financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.   16 Table of ContentsWe are exposed to interest rate risk and there can be no assurances that we will manage or mitigate thisrisk effectively.  We are exposed to interest rate risk, primarily as a result of our Credit Agreement. Borrowings under our CreditAgreement bear interest at a floating rate. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates will increase the amount of interest we must pay under our Credit Agreement. Our interest rate risk may materially change in the future if we increase ourborrowings under the Credit Agreement, or amend our Credit Agreement or Prudential Loan Agreement, seek other sources of debt or equity capital or refinance our outstanding debt. A significant increase in interest rates could also make it moredifficult to find alternative financing on desirable terms. (For additional information with respect to interest rate risk, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks, as filed with this Annual Reporton Form 10-K.)  Future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our equity securities. Our future growth will depend upon our ability to raise additional capital. If we were to raise additional capital through the issuance ofequity securities, we could dilute the interest of holders of our common stock. The interest of our common stockholders could also be diluted by the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to stock incentive plans. Accordingly, the Board ofDirectors may authorize the issuance of equity securities that could dilute, or otherwise adversely affect, the interest of holders of our common stock. We may change our dividend policy and the dividends we pay may be subject to significant volatility. The decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such futuredividends, will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on such factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant. In addition, our Credit Agreement and our Prudential Loan Agreement prohibit the payments of dividendsduring certain events of default. No assurance can be given that our financial performance in the future will permit our payment of any dividends or that the amount of dividends we pay, if any, will not fluctuate significantly. Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, our ability to pay dividends would be restricted if, after payment of the dividend, (1) wewould not be able to pay indebtedness as it becomes due in the usual course of business or (2) our total assets would be less than the sum of our liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if we were to be dissolved, to satisfy therights of any shareholders with liquidation preferences. There currently are no shareholders with liquidation preferences.  To qualify fortaxation as a REIT, we must, among other requirements such as those related to the composition of our assets and gross income, distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income, including taxable income that is accrued by uswithout a corresponding receipt of cash. We cannot provide any assurance that our cash flows will permit us to continue paying cash dividends. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has allowed the use of a procedure, as a result of which wecould satisfy the REIT income distribution requirement by making a distribution on our common stock comprised of (i) shares of our common stock having a value of up to 80% of the total distribution and (ii) cash in the remaining amount ofthe total distribution, in lieu of paying the distribution entirely in cash. In order to use this procedure, we would need to seek and obtain a private letter ruling of the IRS to the effect that the procedure is applicable to our situation. Withoutobtaining such a private letter ruling, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to satisfy our REIT income distribution requirement by making distributions payable in whole or in part in shares of our common stock. It is also possiblethat instead of distributing 100% of our taxable income on an annual basis, we may decide to retain a portion of our taxable income and to pay taxes on such amounts as permitted by the IRS. In the event that we pay a portion of a dividend in sharesof our common stock, taxable U.S. shareholders would be required to pay tax on the entire amount of the dividend, including the portion paid in shares of common stock, in which case such shareholders might have to pay the tax using cash from othersources. If a U.S. shareholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our common stock atthe time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to non-U.S. shareholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such dividend, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock. In addition, if asignificant number of our shareholders sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, such sales would put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock. As a result of the factors described herein and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and those that are described from time to time inour other filings with the SEC, we may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, revenues, operating expenses, resultsof operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or our stock price.  Changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of ourpublicly traded common stock.  As with other publicly traded securities, the market price of our publicly traded common stockdepends on various market conditions, which may change from time-to-time. Among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded common stock are the following:    our financial condition and performance and that of our significant tenants,     the markets perception of our growth potential and potential future earnings,   17 Table of Contents  the reputation of REITs generally and the reputation of REITs with portfolios similar to us,     the attractiveness of the securities of REITs in comparison to securities issued by other entities (including securities issued by other real estate companies),    an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for publicly traded securities,    the extent of institutional investor interest in us, and     general economic and financial market conditions.  In order to preserve our REIT status, our charterlimits the number of shares a person may own, which may discourage a takeover that could result in a premium price for our common stock or otherwise benefit our stockholders. Our charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our Board of Directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve ourqualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Unless exempted by our Board of Directors, no person may actually or constructively own more than 5% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding shares ofour common stock or the outstanding shares of any class or series of our preferred stock, which may inhibit large investors from desiring to purchase our stock. This restriction may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change incontrol, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all of our assets) that might provide a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. Maryland law may discourage a third-party from acquiring us. We are subject to the provisions of Maryland Business Combination Act (the Business Combination Act) which prohibits transactionsbetween a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for 5 (five) years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Generally, pursuant to theBusiness Combination Act, an interested stockholder is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of a Maryland corporations voting stock. These provisions couldhave the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of our Company or reducing the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our capital stock. Additionally, the Maryland Control ShareAcquisition Act may deny voting rights to shares involved in an acquisition of one-tenth or more of the voting stock of a Maryland corporation. In our charter and bylaws, we have elected not to have the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act applyto any acquisition by any person of shares of stock of our Company. However, in the case of the control share acquisition statute, our Board of Directors may opt to make this statute applicable to us at any time by amending our bylaws, and may do soon a retroactive basis. Finally, the unsolicited takeovers provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law permit our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter orbylaws, to implement certain provisions that may have the effect of inhibiting a third-party from making an acquisition proposal for our Company or of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our Company under circumstances thatotherwise could provide the holders of our common stocks with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price or that stockholders may otherwise believe is in their best interests. Inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Although inflation has not materially impacted our results of operations in the recent past, increased inflation could have a more pronouncednegative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations. During times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, as provided for in our leases, rent increases may not keep up with the rate ofinflation. Likewise, even though our triple-net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation, substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operatingexpenses exceed increases in revenue, which may adversely affect the tenants ability to pay rent.  The loss of certain members of ourmanagement team could adversely affect our business.  We depend upon the skills and experience of our executive officers. Loss ofthe services of any of them could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. Except for the employment agreement with our President and ChiefExecutive Officer, David B. Driscoll, we do not have employment agreements with any of our executives.   18 Table of ContentsAmendments to the Accounting Standards Codification made by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (theFASB) or changes in accounting standards issued by other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability or financial position. Our consolidated financial statements are subject to the application of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) inaccordance with the Accounting Standards Codification, which is periodically amended by the FASB. The application of GAAP is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, we are required to adopt amendments to the AccountingStandards Codification or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time-to-time by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB and the SEC. Those changes could adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability orfinancial position.  Our assets may be subject to impairment charges. We periodically evaluate our real estate investments and other assets for impairment indicators. The judgment regarding the existence ofimpairment indicators is based on GAAP, and includes a variety of factors such as market conditions, our assumptions and the accumulation of asset retirement costs as a result of increases in estimated environmental liabilities, the status ofsignificant leases, the financial condition of major tenants and other factors that could affect the cash flow from or fair value of our properties. During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we incurred $13.4 million and $13.9 million,respectively, of non-cash impairment charges. We may be required to take similar non-cash impairment charges, which could affect the implementation of our current business strategy and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition andresults of operations.  Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the market on which our common stock trades, the markets inwhich we operate, our operations and our results of operations.  Terrorist attacks or other acts of violence or war could affectour business or the businesses of our tenants. The consequences of armed conflicts are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. More generally, any of these events could cause consumerconfidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States and worldwide financial markets and economy. Terrorist attacks also could be a factor resulting in, or a continuation of, an economic recession in the UnitedStates or abroad. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. We rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology couldharm our business.  We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and storeelectronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, including financial transactions and maintenance of records, which may include personal identifying information of tenants and lease data. We rely on commerciallyavailable systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting and storing confidential tenant information, such as individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts. Although we have takensteps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems, it is possible that our security measures will not be able to prevent the systems improper functioning, or the improper disclosure of personally identifiableinformation such as in the event of cyber attacks. Security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure ofconfidential information. Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and couldmaterially and adversely affect us"
9,GTY,GETTY REALTY CORP,2013-03-18,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
 We are subject to various risks, many of which are beyond our control. As a result of these and otherfactors, we may experience material fluctuations in our future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to paydividends or stock price. An investment in our stock involves various risks, including those mentioned below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and those that are described from time to time in our other filings with the SEC. We are repositioning our properties that were previously leased to Marketing. We expect to incur significant costsassociated with repositioning these properties and we expect to generate less net revenue after leasing or selling these properties. The incurrence of these costs and receipt of less net revenue may materially negatively impact our cash flow andability to pay dividends.  We are in the process of repositioning the properties that were previouslyleased to Getty Petroleum Marketing Inc. (Marketing) comprising a unitary premises pursuant to a master lease (the Master Lease). During 2012, we have entered into long-term triple-net leases with respect to 443 of theseproperties. In addition, we have entered into month-to-month license agreements and interim fuel supply arrangements with respect to our operating properties. The remaining properties previously leased to Marketing are accounted for as held forsale, and are either subject to month-to-month licensing agreements or are vacant. Our month-to-month license agreements allow the licensee to occupy and to use the properties for gas stations, convenience stores, automotive repair servicefacilities or other businesses. We receive monthly payments from the licensee-operators while remaining responsible for all operating expenses, including maintenance, repairs, real estate taxes, insurance and general upkeep (PropertyExpenditures) and environmental costs. Dependent on factors related to each site, we expect to directly pay for varying types of costs over a period of years for deferred maintenance, required renovations, replacement of underground storagetanks and related equipment and zoning and permitting costs (Capital Improvements). It is possible we may enter into additional long-term triple-net leases for certain of these properties with tenants who are actively engaged in thebusiness of retail petroleum marketing.  We, or our tenants, have commenced eviction proceedings involvingapproximately 40 properties in various jurisdictions against Marketings former subtenants (or sub-subtenants) who have not vacated our properties and occupy our properties without rights. We are incurring significant costs, primarily legalexpenses, in connection with such proceedings.  We are currently generating less net revenue from the leasingof these properties and we expect that following the completion of the repositioning process, we will continue to generate less net revenue from these properties than we previously received from Marketing. In addition, dependent on factors relatedto each site we expect to directly pay for Property Expenditures during the repositioning process and possibly thereafter and for Capital Improvements over a period of years. It is possible that issues involved in re-letting or repositioning these properties may require significant managementattention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. The incurrence of these costs and receipt of less net revenue from our properties that were subject to the Master Lease may materially negatively impact our cash flow and ability topay dividends.  Our future cash flow is dependent on the performance of our tenants of their lease obligations, renewalof existing leases and either re-letting or selling our vacant properties.  We are subject to risksthat financial distress, default or bankruptcy of our tenants may lead to vacancy at our properties or disruption in rent receipts as a result of partial payment or nonpayment of rent or that expiring leases may not be renewed. Under unfavorablegeneral economic conditions, there can be no assurance that our tenants level of sales and financial performance generally will not be adversely affected, which in turn, could impact the reliability of our rent receipts. We are subject torisks that the terms governing renewal or re-letting of our properties (including the cost of required renovations, replacement of underground storage tanks and related equipment or environmental remediation) may be less favorable than current leaseterms (or prior lease terms in the case of vacant properties). We are also subject to the risk that we may receive less net proceeds from the properties we sell as   8 Table of Contentscompared to their current carrying value or that the value of our properties may be adversely affected by unfavorable general economic conditions. Unfavorable general economic conditions may alsonegatively impact our ability to re-let or sell our properties. Numerous properties compete with our properties in attracting tenants to lease space. The number of available or competitive properties in a particular area could have a materialadverse effect on our ability to lease or sell our properties and on the rents we are able to charge. In addition to the risk of disruption in rent receipts, we are subject to the risk of incurring real estate taxes, maintenance, environmental andother expenses at vacant properties.  The financial distress, default or bankruptcy of our tenants may alsolead to protracted and expensive processes for retaking control of our properties than would otherwise be the case, including, eviction or other legal proceedings related to or resulting from the tenants default. These risks are greater withrespect to certain of our tenants who lease multiple properties from us. If a tenant files for bankruptcy protection it is possible that we would recover substantially less than the full value of our claims against the tenant. If our tenants do notperform their lease obligations; or we are unable to renew existing leases and promptly recapture and re-let or sell vacant locations; or if lease terms upon renewal or re-letting are less favorable than current lease terms; or if the values ofproperties that we sell are adversely affected by market conditions; or if we incur significant costs or disruption related to or resulting from tenant financial distress, default or bankruptcy; then our cash flow could be significantly adverselyaffected.  We are continuing our efforts to sell certain properties. We cannot predict the terms or timing of any suchproperty dispositions. If we do not obtain favorable terms on such dispositions, our operations and financial performance may be negatively impacted.  We are continuing our efforts to sell properties, including those properties which are accounted for as held for sale. While we have dedicated considerable effort designed to increase sales activity, wecannot predict if or when property dispositions will close and whether the terms of any such disposition will be favorable to us. It is likely that we will retain environmental liabilities that exist with respect to that property or group ofproperties prior to the date of sale, to the extent there is no third-party responsible therefor. If we do not obtain favorable terms on such dispositions, our operations and financial performance will be negatively impacted. We maintain significant pre-petition and post-petition claims against Marketing. We cannot provide any assurance that our claimswill be accepted or paid  As part of Marketings bankruptcy proceeding, we maintain significantpre-petition and post-petition claims against Marketing. Certain of our claims are considered administrative claims and have priority over other claims. We have agreed to cap our aggregate priority administrative claims at the amount of $10.5million, together with interest from May 1, 2012 until paid at the rate provided in the Master Lease. As of the date of this filing on Form 10-K, the outstanding unpaid principal amount of our administration claim is $7.4 million. We cannotpredict how much of these unpaid obligations we will ultimately collect, if any.  We have agreed to advance funds to theliquidating trustee of the Marketing Estate. We cannot give any assurance that we will be repaid any amounts of our loans or be reimbursed for our legal fees. The Bankruptcy Court has appointed a liquidating trustee to oversee the liquidation of the Marketing estate (theMarketing Estate). In December 2011, the Marketing Estate filed a lawsuit against Marketings former parent, Lukoil Americas Corporation, and certain of its affiliates (collectively, Lukoil), as well as the formerdirectors and officers of Marketing (the Lukoil Complaint). The Lukoil Complaint asserts, among other claims, that Marketings sale of assets to Lukoil in November 2009 constituted a fraudulent conveyance, and that the assets ortheir value can be recovered from Lukoil. In addition, the Lukoil Complaint asserts that the former directors and officers violated their fiduciary duties to Marketing in approving and effectuating the challenged sale, and are liable for moneydamages. The Liquidating Trustee is pursuing these claims for the benefit of the Marketing Estate.  In October2012, we entered into an agreement with the Marketing Estate to make loans and otherwise fund up to an aggregate amount of $6.4 million to fund the prosecution of the Lukoil Complaint and certain expenses incurred by the Marketing Estate (theLitigation Funding Agreement). It is possible that we may agree to advance amounts in excess of $6.4 million. We advanced $1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 and $0.1 million in the first quarter of 2013 to the Marketing Estatepursuant to the Litigation Funding Agreement. The Litigation Funding Agreement also provides that we are entitled to be reimbursed for up to $1.3 million of our legal fees in connection with the Litigation Funding Agreement. Based on the terms ofthe Litigation Funding Agreement, we have recorded a receivable of $3.0 million as of December 31, 2012, which includes amounts advanced and amounts due for reimbursable legal fees we incurred in connection with the Litigation FundingAgreement. Payments that we receive pursuant to the Litigation Funding Agreement will not reduce our Administrative Claim or our other pre-petition and post-petition claims against Marketing. A portion of the payments we receive pursuant to theLitigation Funding Agreement may be subject to federal income taxes. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be repaid any amounts we advance pursuant to the Litigation Funding Agreement or the reimbursable legal fees we have incurred. Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial position and results ofoperations, and they require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain.  Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial position and results of operations. We have identified several accounting policies as being critical to thepresentation of our financial position and results of   9 Table of Contentsoperations because they require management to make particularly subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially differentamounts would be recorded under different conditions or using different assumptions. We cannot provide any assurance that we will not make subsequent significant adjustments to our consolidated financial statements. Estimates, judgments andassumptions underlying our consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, receivables and related reserves, deferred rent receivable, income under direct financing leases, asset retirement obligations including environmentalremediation obligations, real estate, depreciation and amortization, impairment of long-lived assets, litigation, accrued liabilities, income taxes and allocation of the purchase price of properties acquired to the assets acquired and liabilitiesassumed.  If our accounting policies, methods, judgments, assumptions and allocations prove to be incorrect,or if circumstances change, our business, financial condition, revenues, operating expense, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price may be materially adversely affected. We are dependent on external sources of capital which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. We are dependent on external sources of capital to maintain our status as a REIT and must distribute to our shareholderseach year at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding any net capital gain. Because of these distribution requirements, it is not likely that we will be able to fund all future capital needs, including acquisitions, from income fromoperations. Therefore, we will have to continue to rely on third-party sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.  Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash flows from operations, funds available under our Credit Agreement that matures in August 2015 and available cash and cash equivalents. On February 25,2013, we entered into a $175 million senior secured revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with a group of commercial banks led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the Bank Syndicate), which is scheduled to mature inAugust 2015 and a $100 million senior secured long-term loan agreement with the Prudential Insurance Company of America (the Prudential Loan Agreement), which matures in February 2021. On February 25, 2013, we also repaid andterminated our existing credit agreement with a group of commercial banks led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and our term loan agreement with TD Bank. For additional information, please refer to Credit Agreement and PrudentialLoan Agreement in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources which appears in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our ability to meet the financial and other covenants relating to our Credit Agreement and our Prudential Loan Agreementis dependent on our continued ability to meet certain criteria as further described in note 4 in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and the performance of our tenants. Ifwe are not in compliance with one or more of our covenants, which could result in an event of default under our Credit Agreement or our Prudential Loan Agreement, there can be no assurance that our lenders would waive such non-compliance. This couldhave a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition, results of operation, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.  As part of our overall growth strategy, we regularly review acquisition and financing opportunities to acquire additional properties, and we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions that we believe willbenefit our financial performance. To the extent that our current sources of liquidity are not sufficient to fund such acquisitions, we will require other sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Our access to third-party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors including general marketconditions, the markets perception of our growth potential, financial stability, our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions, covenants and limitations imposed under our Credit Agreement and our Prudential Loan Agreementand the market price of our common stock.  Our business operations may not generate sufficient cash for distributions ordebt service.  There is no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow fromoperations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay dividends on our common stock, to pay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may not be able to repay or refinance existingindebtedness on favorable terms, which could force us to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms (which may also result in losses) or accept financing on unfavorable terms. We may acquire new properties, and this may create risks. We may acquire or develop properties when we believe that an acquisition or development matches our business strategies.These properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential. It is possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline after we acquire them, they may not performas expected and, if financed using debt or new equity issuances, may result in shareholder dilution. Our acquisition of properties will expose us to the liabilities of those properties, some of which we may not be aware of at the time ofacquisition. We face competition in pursuing these   10 Table of Contentsacquisitions and we may not succeed in leasing acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover their costs of acquisition and operations. Newly acquired properties may require significantmanagement attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. We may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions. Consequences arising from or in connection with any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.  While we seekto grow through accretive acquisitions, acquisitions of properties may be dilutive and may not produce the returns that we expect and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired properties into our portfolio or manage our growtheffectively, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects.  Acquisitions of properties may initially be dilutive to our net income, and such properties may not perform as we expect or produce the returns that we anticipate (including, without limitation, as aresult of tenant bankruptcies, tenant concessions, our inability to collect rents and higher than anticipated operating expenses). Further, we may not successfully integrate one or more of these property acquisitions into our existing portfoliowithout operating disruptions or unanticipated costs. Additionally, to the extent we increase the size of our portfolio, we may not be able to adapt our management, administrative, accounting and operational systems, or hire and retain sufficientoperational staff to integrate acquired properties into our portfolio or manage any future acquisitions of properties without operating disruptions or unanticipated costs. Moreover, our continued growth will require increased investment inmanagement personnel, professional fees, other personnel, financial and management systems and controls and facilities, which will result in additional operating expenses. Under the circumstances described above, our results of operations, financialcondition and growth prospects may be materially and adversely affected.  We are subject to risks inherent in owning andleasing real estate.  We are subject to varying degrees of risk generally related to leasing andowning real estate many of which are beyond our control. In addition to general risks applicable to us, our risks include, among others:      our liability as a lessee for long-term lease obligations regardless of our revenues,     deterioration in national, regional and local economic and real estate market conditions,     potential changes in supply of, or demand for, rental properties similar to ours,     competition for tenants and declining rental rates,     difficulty in selling or re-letting properties on favorable terms or at all,     impairments in our ability to collect rent or other payments due to us when they are due,     increases in interest rates and adverse changes in the availability, cost and terms of financing,     uninsured property liability,      the impact of present or future environmental legislation and compliance with environmental laws,     adverse changes in zoning laws and other regulations,     acts of terrorism and war,      acts of God,      the potential risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time,     the need to periodically renovate and repair our properties, and     physical or weather-related damage to our properties. Each of these factors could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations,liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. In addition, real estate investments are relatively illiquid, which means that our ability to vary our portfolio of properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions may belimited.   11 Table of ContentsAdverse developments in general business, economic, or political conditions could havea material adverse effect on us.  Adverse developments in general business and economic conditions,including through recession, downturn or otherwise, either in the economy generally or in those regions in which a large portion of our business is conducted, could have a material adverse effect on us and significantly increase certain of the riskswe are subject to. The general economic conditions in the United States are, and for an extended period of time may be, significantly less favorable than that of prior years. Among other effects, adverse economic conditions could depress real estatevalues, impact our ability to re-let or sell our properties and have an adverse effect on our tenants level of sales and financial performance generally. Our revenues are dependent on the economic success of our tenants and any factors thatadversely impact our tenants could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. Substantially all of our tenants depend on the same industry for their revenues. We derive substantially all of our revenues from leasing, primarily on a triple-net basis, and financing retail motorfuel and convenience store properties to tenants in the petroleum marketing industry. Accordingly, our revenues are substantially dependent on the economic success of the petroleum marketing industry, and any factors that adversely affect thatindustry, such as disruption in the supply of petroleum or a decrease in the demand for conventional motor fuels due to conservation, technological advancements in petroleum-fueled motor vehicles, or an increase in the use of alternative fuelvehicles, or green technology could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. The success of participants in the petroleummarketing industry depends upon the sale of refined petroleum products at margins in excess of fixed and variable expenses. The petroleum marketing industry is highly competitive and volatile. Petroleum products are commodities, the prices of whichdepend on numerous factors that affect supply and demand. The prices paid by our tenants and other petroleum marketers for products are affected by global, national and regional factors. A large, rapid increase in wholesale petroleum prices wouldadversely affect the profitability and cash flows of our tenants if the increased cost of petroleum products could not be passed on to their customers or if automobile consumption of gasoline was to decline significantly. We cannot be certain howthese factors will affect petroleum product prices or supply in the future, or how in particular they will affect our tenants. Property taxes on our properties may increase without notice. Each of the properties we own or lease is subject to real property taxes. The leases for certain of the properties thatwe lease from third parties obligate us to pay real property taxes with regard to those properties. The real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we acquire or lease in the future may increase as property tax rates changeand as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities. To the extent that our tenants are not responsible for property taxes pursuant to their contractual arrangements with us or are unable or unwilling to pay such increase inaccordance with their leases, our net operating expenses may increase.  We incur significant operating costs as a resultof environmental laws and regulations which costs could significantly rise and reduce our profitability.  We are subject to numerous existing federal, state and local laws and regulations, including matters relating to the protection of the environment. Under certain environmental laws, a current or previousowner or operator of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at, on, or under, such property, and may be required to investigate and clean-up suchcontamination. Such laws typically impose liability and clean-up responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants, or the timing or cause of the contamination, and the liability undersuch laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility. For example, liability may arise as a result of the historical use of a property or from themigration of contamination from adjacent or nearby properties. Any such contamination or liability may also reduce the value of the property. In addition, the owner or operator of a property may be subject to claims by third parties based on injury,damage and/or costs, including investigation and clean-up costs, resulting from environmental contamination present at or emanating from a property. The properties owned or controlled by us are leased primarily as retail motor fuel and conveniencestore properties, and therefore may contain, or may have contained, USTs for the storage of petroleum products and other hazardous or toxic substances, which creates a potential for the release of such products or substances. Some of our propertiesmay be subject to regulations regarding the retirement and decommissioning or removal of long-lived assets including buildings containing hazardous materials, USTs and other equipment. Some of the properties may be adjacent to or near propertiesthat have contained or currently contain USTs used to store petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, certain of the properties are on, adjacent to, or near properties upon which others have engaged or may in the futureengage in activities that may release petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. There may be other environmental problems associated with our properties of which we are unaware. These problems may make it more difficult for us tore-let or sell our properties on favorable terms, or at all.   12 Table of ContentsFor additional information with respect to pending environmental lawsuitsand claims, and environmental remediation obligations and estimates see Item 3. Legal Proceedings, Environmental Matters in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results ofOperations and note 6 in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We enter into leases and various other agreements which allocate responsibility for known and unknown environmentalliabilities by establishing the percentage and method of allocating responsibility between the parties. Our tenants are directly responsible to pay for (i) remediation of environmental contamination they cause and compliance with variousenvironmental laws and regulations as the operators of our properties, and (ii) environmental liabilities allocated to them under the terms of our leases and various other agreements. Generally, the liability for the retirement anddecommissioning or removal of USTs and other equipment is the responsibility of our triple-net tenants. We are contingently liable for these obligations in the event that our tenants do not satisfy their responsibilities. A liability has not beenaccrued for obligations that are the responsibility of our tenants (other than amounts accrued for the Marketing Environmental Liabilities accrued in the fourth quarter of 2011). However, there can be no assurance that our assessments are correct orthat our tenants who have paid their obligations in the past will continue to do so.  We cannot provide anyassurance that the programs under which we are reimbursed from state UST remediation funds will continue to be available to us. Environmental exposures are difficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons, including the extent of contamination,alternative treatment methods that may be applied, location of the property which subjects it to differing local laws and regulations and their interpretations, as well as the time it takes to remediate contamination. In developing our liability forestimated environmental remediation obligations on a property by property basis, we consider among other things, enacted laws and regulations, assessments of contamination and surrounding geology, quality of information available, currentlyavailable technologies for treatment, alternative methods of remediation and prior experience. Environmental accruals are based on estimates which are subject to significant change, and are adjusted as the remediation treatment progresses, ascircumstances change and as environmental contingencies become more clearly defined and reasonably estimable. Adjustments to accrued liabilities for environmental remediation obligations will be reflected in our financial statements as they becomeprobable and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.  It is possible that our assumptions regardingthe ultimate allocation methods and share of responsibility that we used to allocate environmental liabilities may change, which may result in adjustments to the amounts recorded for environmental litigation accruals and environmental remediationliabilities. We will be required to accrue for environmental liabilities that we believe are allocable to others under various other agreements if we determine that it is probable that the counterparty will not meet its environmental obligations. Wemay ultimately be responsible to pay for environmental liabilities as the property owner if the counterparty fails to pay them.  We cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations may be enacted in the future, or if or how existing laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted with respect to products oractivities to which they have not previously been applied. We cannot predict whether state UST fund programs will be administered and funded in the future in a manner that is consistent with past practices and if future environmental spending willcontinue to be eligible for reimbursement at historical recovery rates under these programs. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of the regulatory agencies or stricter interpretation ofexisting laws which may develop in the future, could have an adverse effect on our financial position, or that of our tenants, and could require substantial additional expenditures for future remediation. As a result of the factors discussed above, or others, compliance with environmental laws and regulations could have amaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.  We are defending pending lawsuits and claims and are subject to material losses.  We are subject to various lawsuits and claims, including litigation related to environmental matters, such as those arising from leaking USTs and releases of motor fuel into the environment, and toxictort claims. The ultimate resolution of certain matters cannot be predicted because considerable uncertainty exists both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimate of such loss. Our ultimate liabilities resulting from such lawsuits andclaims, if any, could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. For additional information with respect to pending environmental lawsuits andclaims and environmental remediation obligations and estimates see Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Environmental Matters in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results ofOperations and notes 3 and 6 in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.   13 Table of ContentsA significant portion of our properties are concentrated in the Northeast andMid-Atlantic regions of the United States, and adverse conditions in those regions, in particular, could negatively impact our operations.  A significant portion of the properties we own and lease are located in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. Because of the concentration of our properties in those regions, in theevent of adverse economic conditions in those regions, we would likely experience higher risk of default on payment of rent to us than if our properties were more geographically diversified. Additionally, the rents on our properties may be subjectto a greater risk of default than other properties in the event of adverse economic, political, or business developments or natural hazards that may affect the Northeast or Mid-Atlantic United States and the ability of our lessees to make rentpayments. This lack of geographical diversification could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. We are in a competitive business.  The real estate industry is highly competitive. Where we own properties, we compete for tenants with a large number of real estate property owners and other companies that sublet properties. Our principalmeans of competition are rents we are able to charge in relation to the income producing potential of the location. In addition, we expect other major real estate investors, some with much greater financial resources or more experienced personnelthan we have, will compete with us for attractive acquisition opportunities. These competitors include petroleum manufacturing, distributing and marketing companies, other REITs, public and private investment funds and other individual andinstitutional investors. This competition has increased prices for properties we seek to acquire and may impair our ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms in the future. We are exposed to counterparty risk and there can be no assurances that we will effectively manage or mitigate this risk. We regularly interact with counterparties in various industries. The types of counterparties mostcommon to our transactions and agreements include, but are not limited to, landlords, tenants, vendors and lenders. Our most significant counterparties include, but are not limited to the members of the Bank Syndicate related to our Credit Agreementand the lender that is the counterparty to the Prudential Loan Agreement and one of our tenants from whom we derive a significant amount of revenue. The default, insolvency or other inability of a significant counterparty to perform its obligationsunder an agreement or transaction, including, without limitation, as a result of the rejection of an agreement or transaction in bankruptcy proceedings, could have a material adverse effect on us. One of our tenants, CPD NY Energy Corp., asubsidiary of Chestnut Petroleum Dist. (together with its affiliates, CPD)), represents 18% and 12% of our revenues from rental properties for 2012 and 2011, respectively. It is possible that as a result of either acquiring additionalproperties from CPD or as a result of disposing some of our existing properties, CPD could account for a greater percentage of our revenues from rental properties. We may also undertake additional transactions with our other existing tenants whichwould further concentrate our sources of revenues. Therefore, the failure of a major tenant is likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. We are subject to losses that may not be covered by insurance. We, and certain of our tenants, carry insurance against certain risks and in such amounts as we believe are customary forbusinesses of our kind. However, as the costs and availability of insurance change, we may decide not to be covered against certain losses (such as certain environmental liabilities, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and civil disorder) where, in thejudgment of management, the insurance is not warranted due to cost or availability of coverage or the remoteness of perceived risk. There is no assurance that these insurance coverages are or will be sufficient to cover actual losses incurred. Thedestruction of, or significant damage to, or significant liabilities arising out of conditions at, our properties due to an uninsured cause would result in an economic loss and could result in us losing both our investment in, and anticipatedprofits from, such properties. When a loss is insured, the coverage may be insufficient in amount or duration, or a lessees customers may be lost, such that the lessee cannot resume its business after the loss at prior levels or at all,resulting in reduced rent or a default under its lease. Any such loss relating to a large number of properties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends orstock price.   14 Table of ContentsFailure to qualify as a REIT under the federal income tax laws would have adverseconsequences to our shareholders.  We elected to be treated as a REIT under the federal income taxlaws beginning January 1, 2001. We cannot; however, guarantee that we will continue to qualify in the future as a REIT. We cannot give any assurance that new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will notsignificantly change the requirements relating to our qualification. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing our taxable income and will again be subject to federal incometax at regular corporate rates, we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax, we could be required to pay significant income taxes and we would have less money available for our operations and distributions to shareholders. This wouldlikely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities. We could also be precluded from treatment as a REIT for four taxable years following the year in which we lost the qualification, and all distributions to shareholders would betaxable as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Loss of our REIT status could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability topay dividends or stock price.  We are exposed to interest rate risk and there can be no assurances that we will manageor mitigate this risk effectively.  We are exposed to interest rate risk, primarily as a result of ourCredit Agreement. Borrowings under our Credit Agreement bear interest at a floating rate. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates will increase the amount of interest we must pay under our Credit Agreement. Our interest rate risk may materiallychange in the future if we increase our borrowings under the Credit Agreement, or amend our Credit Agreement or Prudential Loan Agreement, seek other sources of debt or equity capital or refinance our outstanding debt. A significant increase ininterest rates could also make it more difficult to find alternative financing on desirable terms. (For additional information with respect to interest rate risk, see Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About MarketRisks, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.)  Future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest ofholders of our equity securities.  Our future growth will depend upon our ability to raise additionalcapital. If we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities, we could dilute the interest of holders of our common stock. The interest of our common stockholders could also be diluted by the issuance of shares of commonstock pursuant to stock incentive plans. Accordingly, the Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of equity securities that could dilute, or otherwise adversely affect, the interest of holders of our common stock. We may change our dividend policy and the dividends we pay may be subject to significant volatility. The decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future, as well as the timing, amount andcomposition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on such factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant. In addition, our Credit Agreement and our Prudential Loan Agreement prohibitthe payments of dividends during certain events of default. During 2011 and 2012, the Board of Directors significantly reduced, eliminated and then reinstated at a significantly reduced rate, our quarterly dividend. (See the table of cash dividendsdeclared in 2011 and 2012 in Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchase of Equity Securities for additional information.) No assurance can be given that our financial performancein the future will permit our payment of any dividends or that the amount of dividends we pay, if any, will not fluctuate significantly.  Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, our ability to pay dividends would be restricted if, after payment of the dividend, (1) we would not be able to pay indebtedness as it becomes due in theusual course of business or (2) our total assets would be less than the sum of our liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if we were to be dissolved, to satisfy the rights of any shareholders with liquidation preferences. Therecurrently are no shareholders with liquidation preferences.  To qualify for taxation as a REIT, we must, amongother requirements such as those related to the composition of our assets and gross income, distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income, including taxable income that is accrued by us without a corresponding receipt ofcash. We cannot provide any assurance that our cash flows will permit us to continue paying cash dividends. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has allowed the use of a procedure, as a result of which we could satisfy the REIT incomedistribution requirement by making a distribution on our common stock comprised of (i) shares of our common stock having a value of up to 80% of the total distribution and (ii) cash in the remaining amount of the total distribution, inlieu of paying the distribution entirely in cash. In order to use this procedure, we would need to seek and obtain a private letter ruling of the IRS to the effect that the procedure is applicable to our situation. Without obtaining such a privateletter ruling, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to satisfy our REIT income distribution requirement by making distributions payable in whole or in part in shares of our common stock. It is also possible that instead ofdistributing 100% of our taxable income on an annual basis, we may decide to retain a portion of our taxable income and to pay taxes on such amounts as permitted by the IRS. In the event that we pay a portion of  15 Table of Contentsa dividend in shares of our common stock, taxable U.S. shareholders would be required to pay tax on the entire amount of the dividend, including the portion paid in shares of common stock, inwhich case such shareholders might have to pay the tax using cash from other sources. If a U.S. shareholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income withrespect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our common stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to non-U.S. shareholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such dividend, including in respect ofall or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock. In addition, if a significant number of our shareholders sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, such sales would put downward pressure on the market priceof our common stock.  As a result of the factors described herein and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form10-K and those that are described from time to time in our other filings with the SEC, we may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis, which could materially and adversely affect our business,financial condition, revenues, operating expenses, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or our stock price.  Changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded common stock. As with other publicly traded securities, the market price of our publicly traded common stock depends on various marketconditions, which may change from time-to-time. Among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded common stock are the following:      our financial condition and performance and that of our significant tenants,     the markets perception of our growth potential and potential future earnings,     the reputation of REITs generally and the reputation of REITs with portfolios similar to us,     the attractiveness of the securities of REITs in comparison to securities issued by other entities (including securities issued by other real estatecompanies),      an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid forpublicly traded securities,      the extent of institutional investor interest in us, and     general economic and financial market conditions.  In order to preserve our REIT status, our charter limits the number of shares a person may own, which may discourage a takeover that could result in a premium price for our common stock or otherwisebenefit our stockholders.  Our charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our Board of Directors totake such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Unless exempted by our Board of Directors, no person may actually or constructively own more than 5% (by value or number ofshares, whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding shares of our common stock or the outstanding shares of any class or series of our preferred stock, which may inhibit large investors from desiring to purchase our stock. This restriction mayhave the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets) that might provide a premium price for our commonstock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders.  Maryland law may discourage a third-party fromacquiring us.  We are subject to the provisions of Maryland Business Combination Act (theBusiness Combination Act) which prohibits transactions between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for 5 (five) years after the most recent date on which the interestedstockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Generally, pursuant to the Business Combination Act, an interested stockholder is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10% ormore of a Maryland corporations voting stock. These provisions could have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of our Company or reducing the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future forshares of our capital stock. Additionally, the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act may deny voting rights to shares involved in an acquisition of one-tenth or more of the voting stock of a Maryland corporation. In our charter and bylaws, we haveelected not to have the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act apply to any acquisition by any person of shares of stock of our company. However, in   16 Table of Contentsthe case of the control share acquisition statute, our Board of Directors may opt to make this statute applicable to us at any time by amending our bylaws, and may do so on a retroactive basis.Finally, the unsolicited takeovers provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law permit our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to implement certainprovisions that may have the effect of inhibiting a third-party from making an acquisition proposal for our Company or of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our Company under circumstances that otherwise could provide theholders of our common stocks with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price or that stockholders may otherwise believe is in their best interests. Inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Although inflation has not materially impacted our results of operations in the recent past, increased inflation couldhave a more pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations. During times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, as provided for in our leases, rent increases may not keep upwith the rate of inflation. Likewise, even though our triple-net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation, substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increasesin their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue, which may adversely affect the tenants ability to pay rent. The loss of certain members of our management team could adversely affect our business. We depend upon the skills and experience of our executive officers. Loss of the services of any of them could have amaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. Except for the employment agreement with our President and Chief Executive Officer, David B. Driscoll, we do nothave employment agreements with any of our executives.  Amendments to the Accounting Standards Codification made by theFinancial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) or changes in accounting standards issued by other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability or financial position. Our financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification,which is periodically amended by the FASB. The application of GAAP is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, we are required to adopt amendments to the Accounting Standards Codification or comply with revised interpretationsthat are issued from time-to-time by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB and the SEC. Those changes could adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability or financial position. Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the market on which our common stock trades, the markets in which weoperate, our operations and our results of operations.  Terrorist attacks or other acts of violence orwar could affect our business or the businesses of our tenants. The consequences of armed conflicts are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. More generally, any of these eventscould cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States and worldwide financial markets and economy. Terrorist attacks also could be a factor resulting in, or a continuation of, an economicrecession in the United States or abroad. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price"
6,GTY,GETTY REALTY CORP,2012-03-15,">Item 1A. RiskFactors  We are subject to various risks, many of which are beyond our control. As a result of these andother factors, we may experience material fluctuations in our future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to paydividends or stock price. An investment in our stock involves various risks, including those mentioned below and elsewhere this Annual Report on Form 10-K and those that are described from time to time in our other filings with the SEC.   10 Table of ContentsOur largest tenant has filed for bankruptcy protection. We cannot provide any assurance that Marketingwill be able to meet its pre-petition and post-petition obligations under the Master Lease or any related court orders.  From August through December 2011, Marketing did not pay monthly fixed rent to us on the first of the month, as required by the terms of the Master Lease. Following each such nonpayment event, wedelivered a default notice to Marketing, and, for the months of August and September 2011, Marketing cured its default by payment of the outstanding monthly fixed rent installment with applicable interest. In August 2011, Marketing delivered anotice to us stating its intent to offset rent due under the Master Lease based upon allegations of nonperformance by us of certain environmental remediation obligations allegedly required to be performed by us pursuant to the terms of the MasterLease. We considered Marketings notice to be without merit and filed a lawsuit in New York State Supreme Court to stop Marketing from offsetting rent. At about the same time, we also issued a separate default notice against Marketing forvarious violations of the Master Lease, including nonpayment of certain real estate taxes attributable to properties subject to the Master Lease.  In October 2011, the New York State Supreme Court ordered Marketing to pay $4.0 million of October 2011 fixed rent to us and the balance ($0.9 million) into escrow, pending resolution of Marketingsclaims. Marketing complied with this court order and made the required payments. In November 2011, Marketing again withheld rent on the purported basis of its offset notice, and in mid-November 2011 the New York State Supreme Court again orderedMarketing to pay the majority of November 2011 rent to us and the balance into escrow. On appeal by Marketing, the New York State Appellate Division stayed the lower court order, but ordered Marketing to pay the entire amount of fixed rent forNovember 2011 ($4.9 million) into escrow by November 28, 2011. Marketing failed to comply with the terms of the Appellate Division order and pay the amount of November 2011 fixed rent into escrow on November 28, 2011. Consequently, weissued a notice to Marketing terminating the Master Lease which, pursuant to the terms of the Master Lease and such notice, terminated the Master Lease as of December 12, 2011. On December 5, 2011, Marketing filed for Chapter 11bankruptcy protection in the Bankruptcy Court. On March 7, 2012 we entered into a Stipulation (described below) with Marketing and the Creditors Committee seeking an order from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court and as a result, we expect we will retakepossession of our properties commencing in the second quarter of 2012. Based on information available to us as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe it is more likely than not that after we retake possession of all of theproperties subject to the Master Lease, Marketings business will be placed into liquidation. (For additional information regarding the historical portion of our financial results that are attributable to Marketing, see note 12 inItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)  We estimate that Marketings accrued obligations to us as of the date Marketing filed bankruptcy to be approximately $8.8 million. This aggregate amount consists primarily of unpaid fixed rent andreal estate taxes (including real estate taxes that we began paying in the first quarter of 2012, which taxes Marketing historically paid directly) and to a lesser extent other property-related expenses which are Marketings responsibilitypursuant to the Master Lease. These unpaid obligations are considered pre-petition claims and subject to discharge by Marketing in its bankruptcy proceedings. We do not expect to collect any of these pre-petition claims and we have fullyreserved the amount due from Marketing for such claims.  In addition, subsequent to filing the Bankruptcypetition, to date Marketing has failed to pay us $12.6 million in contractual rent, real estate taxes and other expenses payable by Marketing under the Master Lease attributable to the first quarter of 2012. Other than amounts due prior toApril 30, 2012 pursuant to the payment schedule provided for in the Stipulation, we believe it is not likely that we will collect the unpaid post-petition amounts due from Marketing. As in the case with the pre-petition claims, there is noassurance that we will collect such amounts. Based on information available to us as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we cannot provide any assurance that Marketing will be able to meet its pre and post-petition obligations under theMaster Lease or any related court orders.  We intend to reposition our properties that were subject to the Master Lease. We expect toincur significant costs associated with repositioning these properties to generate cash flow over a period of years. The incurrence of these costs may materially negatively impact our cash flow and ability to pay dividends. We intend to remove and reposition our properties from the Master Lease to generate cash flows as promptly as practicable.On March 7, 2012 we entered into a Stipulation with Marketing and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors in Marketings bankruptcy proceedings seeking an order from the Bankruptcy Court and as a result, we expect we will retakepossession of our properties commencing in the second quarter of 2012. The Stipulation has been filed with the Bankruptcy Court along with a motion seeking its approval which is currently scheduled to be heard by the Bankruptcy Court on April 2,2012. No assurances can be given that the Stipulation will be approved. It is likely that the repositioning process will create multiple tenancies with respect to  11 Table of Contentsthe portfolio that was leased to Marketing under the Master Lease. We expect to enter into intermediate and long-term triple-net leases for groups of these properties with tenants who areactively engaged in the business of retail petroleum marketing. However, in the short-term, it is possible that we may reposition groups of properties by: (a) entering into temporary short-term arrangements with the existing occupants of theproperties or operators of groups of properties, allowing them to continue to use and occupy the premises as long as they continue to pay us appropriate compensation and abide by other appropriate covenants, (b) entering into fuel supplyagreements with third party fuel suppliers, (c) entering into long-term leases with distributors engaged in the sale of gasoline and other motor products, (d) disposing of some properties by sale or (e) continuing an existingsub-lease on a direct basis between such former Marketing subtenant and us, whether on substantially the same terms that had previously been in place between such subtenant and Marketing or on modified terms. Following completion of the repositioning process, we expect the revenue realized from the properties that were subjectto the Master Lease to be less than the contractual rent received under the Master Lease. In addition, we expect to incur Property Expenditures and Capital Expenditures (as defined below) during and after the repositioning process. Since the Master Lease was structured as a triple-net lease, Marketing (as the lessee) had the responsibilityfor the maintenance, repair, real estate taxes, insurance and general upkeep of these properties (Property Expenditures) during the term of the Master Lease. Marketing has failed to meet many of its obligations to undertake the PropertyExpenditures related to our properties. Marketing also did not pay for any additional Property Expenditures for the period after termination of the Master Lease. Accordingly, in the course of repositioning the properties, we expect to incursignificant costs over a period of years for required renovations, replacement of underground storage tanks and related equipment or environmental remediation, zoning and permitting along with making capital expenditures to comply with federal lawssuch as the Americans with Disabilities Act (Capital Improvements).  We expect that we willcontinue to incur costs associated with both the bankruptcy proceedings with Marketing and the process of taking control of our properties. It is possible that we may have to take title to gasoline before we distribute it to our lessees and that wemay incur additional costs as a result of eviction proceedings we may have to initiate to take control of our properties. We anticipate incurring significant Property Expenditures and Capital Improvement costs. It is also possible that our estimatesfor environmental remediation and underground storage tank removal expenses relating to these properties will be higher than the Marketing Environmental Liabilities (as defined below) we have accrued. In the first quarter of 2012 we began paying the real estate taxes due on the properties subject to the Master Lease, andbilling Marketing therefor. Revenues from rental properties and rental property expense included $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 for real estate taxes paid (or accrued) by us which were due from Marketing. We expect that inthe near term we will also be required to pay or accrue for, Property Expenditures, environmental and other operating expenses relating to the properties subject to the Master Lease. In addition, it is possible that issues involved in re-letting orrepositioning these properties may require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to other aspects of our ongoing business. In connection with our repositioning of the properties subject to the Master Lease, we anticipatethat, as between us and any new tenant or transferee of a property or group of properties, we will in almost all cases retain environmental liabilities that exist with respect to that property or group of properties prior to the date of re-lettingor sale, to the extent there is no third party responsible therefor. These and other actions are expected to significantly increase our overhead expenses for the foreseeable future. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have notdetermined the total amounts of any such potential additional expenses. The incurrence of these expenses will materially negatively impact our cash flow and ability to pay dividends.  As a result of the developments with Marketing, we have recognized certain expenses and accrued certain other expenses. We cannot provide any assurances that the amounts that we have recognized oraccrued will not change significantly. Changes to our estimates may negatively impact our cash flows and ability to pay dividends.  During the quarter ended December 31, 2011, we recorded a non-cash allowance for deferred rental revenue of $8.7 million (in addition to the $11.0 million allowance recorded during the quarter endedSeptember 30, 2011) fully reserving for the deferred rent receivable relating to the Master Lease. These non-cash allowances reduced our net earnings and funds from operations for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2011, butdid not impact our cash flow from operating activities or adjusted funds from operations since the impact of the straight line method of accounting is not included in our determination of adjusted funds from operations. We also provided an $8.8million reserve for bad debts, primarily attributable to nonpayment of pre-petition rent and real estate taxes due from Marketing. In addition, we have accrued $47.9 million as the aggregate Marketing Environmental Liabilities. Our estimate isbased, in part, upon our belief that we will recover a portion of the Marketing Environmental Liabilities from state agencies. We cannot provide any assurance that the programs under which we are reimbursed from state UST remediation funds willcontinue to be available to us. In conjunction with recording the Marketing Environmental Liabilities, we increased the carrying value   12 Table of Contentsfor each of the related properties by the amount of the related estimated environmental obligation and simultaneously recorded impairment charges aggregating $17.0 million where the increasedcarrying value of the property exceeded its estimated fair value. The increases in carrying values of the properties will be depreciated over (i) the estimated remaining life of the underground storage tank to the extent the increase incarrying value related to obligations to remove underground storage tanks, (ii) a ten year period to the extent the increase in carrying value related to environmental remediation obligations or (iii) such shorter period if circumstanceswarrant, such as the remaining lease term for properties we lease from others. The actual amount of the Marketing Environmental Liabilities may be significantly higher and we can provide no assurance as to the accuracy of our estimates. We do notmaintain pollution legal liability insurance to protect us from potential future claims related to known and unknown environmental liabilities. Changes to our estimates may materially negatively impact our cash flow and ability to pay dividends. Our future cash flow is dependent on the performance of our tenants of their lease obligations, renewal of existing leases and eitherre-letting or selling our vacant properties and properties being repositioned that were previously subject to the Master Lease.  In addition to the risks related to Marketing as described herein, we are subject to risks that financial distress, default or bankruptcy of our other tenants may lead to vacancy at our properties ordisruption in rent receipts as a result of partial payment or nonpayment of rent or that expiring leases may not be renewed. Under unfavorable general economic conditions, there can be no assurance that our tenants level of sales and financialperformance generally will not be adversely affected, which in turn, could impact the reliability of our rent receipts. We are subject to risks that the terms governing (i) the properties previously subject to the Master Lease that are beingrepositioned and (ii) renewal or re-letting of our other properties (including the cost of required renovations, replacement of underground storage tanks and related equipment or environmental remediation) may be less favorable than currentlease terms. We are also subject to the risk that the values of our properties that we sell may be adversely affected by unfavorable general economic conditions. Unfavorable general economic conditions may also negatively impact our ability tore-let or sell our properties. Numerous properties compete with our properties in attracting tenants to lease space. The number of available or competitive properties in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on our ability to leaseor sell our properties and on the rents we are able to charge. In addition to the risk of disruption in rent receipts, we are subject to the risk of incurring real estate taxes, maintenance, environmental and other expenses at vacant properties. The financial distress, default or bankruptcy of our tenants may also lead to protracted and expensiveprocesses for retaking control of our properties than would otherwise be the case, including, eviction or other legal proceedings related to or resulting from the tenants default. These risks are greater with respect to certain of our tenantswho lease multiple properties from us. If a tenant files for bankruptcy protection it is possible that we would recover substantially less than the full value of our claims against the tenant. If our tenants do not perform their lease obligations;or we are unable to renew existing leases and promptly recapture and re-let or sell vacant locations; or if lease terms upon renewal or re-letting are less favorable than current lease terms; or if the values of properties that we sell are adverselyaffected by market conditions; or if we incur significant costs or disruption related to or resulting from tenant financial distress, default or bankruptcy; then our cash flow could be significantly adversely affected. As part of our efforts to reposition our properties that were subject to the Master Lease, it is likely that we will sell some of our properties.We cannot predict the terms or timing of any such dispositions. If we do not obtain favorable terms on such dispositions, our operations and financial performance will be negatively impacted. We are continuing our efforts to sell approximately 160 properties that have previously had their underground storagetanks removed and nine petroleum distribution terminals, although alternatively we may seek to re-let some of these properties and terminals. Additionally, as part of the Bankruptcy proceedings and repositioning of our properties, we may selladditional properties that were subject to the Master Lease. While we have dedicated considerable effort designed to increase sales and leasing activity, we cannot predict if or when property dispositions will close and whether the terms of any suchdisposition will be favorable to us. It is likely that we will in almost all cases retain environmental liabilities that exist with respect to that property or group of properties prior to the date of sale, to the extent there is no third partyresponsible therefor. If we do not obtain favorable terms on such dispositions, our operations and financial performance will be negatively impacted.  We have entered into a stipulation with Marketing and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors in the Bankruptcy proceedings, which if approved by the Court, will become an order of theBankruptcy Court. We cannot predict if the Court will approve the Stipulation or if Marketing will comply with the terms of the Stipulation. If Marketing fails to comply with the Stipulation or if the Court does not approve the Stipulation, it maydelay or inhibit and increase the cost and timing of our process for repositioning the properties subject to the Master Lease.   13 Table of ContentsOn March 7, 2012, we entered into a stipulation with Marketing and theOfficial Committee of Unsecured Creditors in the Bankruptcy proceedings (the Creditors Committee), which is subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court (the Stipulation). Our decision to enter into the Stipulation wasbased on our belief that doing so avoided possible costly litigation, improved our ability to capture cash flow relating to the properties subject to the Master Lease, minimized disruption to the operations of our properties that could occur fromcessation of gas sales by the operators thereof, and permitted us to take greater control of the process for orderly recapture and re-letting or other re-disposition of our properties. The Stipulation has been filed with the Bankruptcy Court withnotice that a hearing will be held on April 2, 2012 to consider its approval by the Bankruptcy Court. No assurance can be given that the Stipulation will be approved by the Bankruptcy Court. If Marketing fails to comply with the Stipulation or if the Court does not approve the Stipulation, our business,financial condition, revenues, operating expenses, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price may be adversely affected.  Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial position and results of operations, and they require management to make estimates, judgments andassumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain.  Our accounting policies and methods arefundamental to how we record and report our financial position and results of operations. We have identified several accounting policies as being critical to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations because they requiremanagement to make particularly subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be recorded under different conditions or using different assumptions.Because of the inherent uncertainty of the estimates, judgments and assumptions associated with these critical accounting policies, we cannot provide any assurance that we will not make subsequent significant adjustments to our consolidatedfinancial statements. Estimates, judgments and assumptions underlying our consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, accounts receivable, deferred rent receivable, income under direct financing leases, environmentalremediation costs, real estate, depreciation and amortization, impairment of long-lived assets, litigation, accrued liabilities, income taxes and allocation of the purchase price of properties acquired to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.If our judgments, assumptions and allocations prove to be incorrect, or if circumstances change, our business, financial condition, revenues, operating expense, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price may bematerially adversely affected. (For information regarding our critical accounting policies, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Critical Accounting Policies.) We are dependent on external sources of capital which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. We are dependent on external sources of capital to maintain our status as a REIT and must distribute to our shareholderseach year at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding any net capital gain. Because of these distribution requirements, it is not likely that we will be able to fund all future capital needs, including acquisitions, from income fromoperations. Therefore, we will have to continue to rely on third party sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.  Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash flows from operations and available cash and cash equivalents. Historically, we have also utilized our Credit Agreement which was amended on March 9,2012 and the maturity date extended by one year to March 2013 (the Amended Credit Agreement). See note 4 in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for adescription of the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement and the terms of the amendment to the three year term loan agreement with TD Bank (the Amended Term Loan Agreement). However, our access to funds under the Amended Credit Agreementhas been severely limited and, in the short-term, it is unlikely that we will be able to access any additional funds under the Amended Credit Agreement. In order to continue to meet our liquidity needs (including the repayment of the balanceoutstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement and the Amended Term Loan Agreement when due in March 2013), we must extend the maturity of or refinance the Amended Credit Agreement and the Amended Term Loan Agreement or obtain additional sources offinancing. Additional sources of financing may be more expensive or contain more onerous terms than exist under the Amended Credit Agreement and the Amended Term Loan Agreement, or simply may not be available. As a result, we may be required toenter into alternative loan agreements, sell assets, reduce or eliminate our dividend or issue additional equity at unfavorable terms if we do not extend the term of the Amended Credit Agreement and the Amended Term Loan Agreement beyond March 2013.There can be no assurance that at or prior to expiration of the Amended Credit Agreement and the Amended Term Loan Agreement we will be able to amend these agreements or enter into a new revolving credit agreement on favorable terms, if at all.  14 Table of ContentsOur ability to meet the financial and other covenants relating to ourAmended Credit Agreement and our Amended Term Loan Agreement is dependent on our continued ability to meet certain criteria as further described in note 4 in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Notes to ConsolidatedFinancial Statements and the performance of our tenants. If we are not in compliance with one or more of our covenants which if not complied with could result in an event of default under our Amended Credit Agreement or our Amended Term LoanAgreement, there can be no assurance that our lenders would waive such non-compliance. In such an event, we would be prohibited from drawing funds against the Amended Credit Agreement and our indebtedness under the Amended Credit Agreement and theAmended Term Loan Agreement could be accelerated. An event of default if not cured or waived would increase by 200 basis points (2.00%) the interest rate we pay under our Amended Credit Agreement and would increase by 300 basis points(3.00%) the interest rate we pay under the Amended Term Loan Agreement. We may be unable to fulfill commitments relating to completion of future acquisitions, if any, and incur monetary losses or damage our reputation if we cannot drawsufficient funds against the Amended Credit Agreement. This could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition, results of operation, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. Our access to third party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors including the successful resolution of theproceedings related to Marketing as described above, general market conditions, the markets perception of our growth potential, financial stability, our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions, covenants and limitationsimposed under our Amended Credit Agreement and our Amended Term Loan Agreement and the market price of our common stock.  Our businessoperations may not generate sufficient cash for distributions or debt service.  There is no assurancethat our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay dividends on our common stock, to pay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidityneeds. We may not be able to repay or refinance existing indebtedness on favorable terms, which could force us to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms (which may also result in losses) or accept financing on unfavorable terms. We may acquire new properties, and this may create risks. We expect that during the period in which we are repositioning the properties subject to the Master Lease, our acquisitionactivities will primarily be focused on reinvesting proceeds we generate from the disposition of properties. Historically, we have acquired properties when we believe that an acquisition matches our business strategies. These properties may havecharacteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential. It is possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline after we acquire them, they may not perform as expected and, iffinanced using debt or new equity issuances, may result in shareholder dilution. Our acquisition of properties will expose us to the liabilities of those properties, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition. We facecompetition in pursuing these acquisitions and we may not succeed in leasing acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover their costs of acquisition and operations. Newly acquired properties may require significant management attention thatwould otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. We may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions. Consequences arising from or in connection with any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.  While we seek to grow through accretiveacquisitions, acquisitions of properties may be dilutive and may not produce the returns that we expect and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired properties into our portfolio or manage our growth effectively, which could have amaterial adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects. Acquisition of properties may initially be dilutive to our net income, and such properties may not perform as we expect orproduce the returns that we anticipate (including, without limitation, as a result of tenant bankruptcies, tenant concessions, our inability to collect rents and higher than anticipated operating expenses). Further, we may not successfully integrateone or more of these property acquisitions into our existing portfolio without operating disruptions or unanticipated costs. Additionally, to the extent we increase the size of our portfolio, we may not be able to adapt our management,administrative, accounting and operational systems, or hire and retain sufficient operational staff to integrate acquired properties into our portfolio or manage any future acquisitions of properties without operating disruptions or unanticipatedcosts. Moreover, our continued growth, including the repositioning of our properties subject to the Master Lease, will require increased investment in management personnel, professional fees, other personnel, financial and management systems andcontrols and facilities, which will result in additional operating expenses. Under the circumstances described above, our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects may be materially and adversely affected.   15 Table of ContentsWe are subject to risks inherent in owning and leasing real estate. We are subject to varying degrees of risk generally related to leasing and owning real estate many of which are beyond ourcontrol. In addition to general risks applicable to us, our risks include, among others:      our liability as a lessee for long-term lease obligations regardless of our revenues,     deterioration in national, regional and local economic and real estate market conditions,     potential changes in supply of, or demand for, rental properties similar to ours,     competition for tenants and declining rental rates,     difficulty in selling or re-letting properties on favorable terms or at all     impairments in our ability to collect rent payments when due,     increases in interest rates and adverse changes in the availability, cost and terms of financing,     the potential for uninsured casualty and other losses due to natural disasters or other causes,     the impact of present or future environmental legislation and compliance with environmental laws,     adverse changes in zoning laws and other regulations, and     acts of terrorism and war.  Each of these factors could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. In addition, real estateinvestments are relatively illiquid, which means that our ability to vary our portfolio of properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be limited.  Adverse developments in general business, economic, or political conditions could have a material adverse effect on us. Adverse developments in general business and economic conditions, including through recession, downturn or otherwise,either in the economy generally or in those regions in which a large portion of our business is conducted, could have a material adverse effect on us and significantly increase certain of the risks we are subject to. The general economic conditionsin the United States are, and for an extended period of time may be, significantly less favorable than that of prior years. Among other effects, adverse economic conditions could depress real estate values, impact our ability to re-let or sell ourproperties and have an adverse effect on our tenants level of sales and financial performance generally. Our revenues are dependent on the economic success of our tenants and any factors that adversely impact our tenants could also have amaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. Substantially all of our tenants depend on the same industry for their revenues. We derive substantially all of our revenues from leasing, primarily on a triple-net basis, retail motor fuel andconvenience store properties and petroleum distribution terminals to tenants in the petroleum marketing industry. Accordingly, our revenues are substantially dependent on the economic success of the petroleum marketing industry, and any factors thatadversely affect that industry, such as disruption in the supply of petroleum or a decrease in the demand for conventional motor fuels due to conservation, technological advancements in petroleum-fueled motor vehicles, or an increase in the use ofalternative fuel vehicles, or green technology could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. The success of participants inthe petroleum marketing industry depends upon the sale of refined petroleum products at margins in excess of fixed and variable expenses. The petroleum marketing industry is highly competitive and volatile. Petroleum products are commodities, theprices of which depend on numerous factors that affect supply and demand. The prices paid by our tenants and other petroleum marketers for products are affected by global, national and regional factors. A large, rapid increase in wholesale petroleumprices would adversely affect the profitability and cash flows of our tenants if the increased cost of petroleum products could not be passed on to their customers or if automobile consumption of gasoline was to decline significantly. We cannot becertain how these factors will affect petroleum product prices or supply in the future, or how in particular they will affect our tenants.   16 Table of ContentsProperty taxes on our properties may increase without notice. Each of the properties we own or lease is subject to real property taxes. The leases for certain of the properties that welease from third parties obligate us to pay real property taxes with regard to those properties. The real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we acquire or lease in the future may increase as property tax rates change andas those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities. To the extent that our tenants are unable or unwilling to pay such increase in accordance with their leases, our net operating expenses may increase. We incur significant operating costs as a result of environmental laws and regulations which costs could significantly rise and reduce ourprofitability.  We are subject to numerous existing federal, state and local laws and regulations,including matters relating to the protection of the environment. Under certain environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxicsubstances or petroleum products at, on, or under, such property, and may be required to investigate and clean-up such contamination. Such laws typically impose liability and clean-up responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operatorknew of or caused the presence of the contaminants, or the timing or cause of the contamination, and the liability under such laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis forallocation of responsibility. For example, liability may arise as a result of the historical use of a property or from the migration of contamination from adjacent or nearby properties. Any such contamination or liability may also reduce the valueof the property. In addition, the owner or operator of a property may be subject to claims by third parties based on injury, damage and/or costs, including investigation and clean-up costs, resulting from environmental contamination present at oremanating from a property. The properties owned or controlled by us are leased primarily as retail motor fuel and convenience store properties, and therefore may contain, or may have contained, USTs for the storage of petroleum products and otherhazardous or toxic substances, which creates a potential for the release of such products or substances. Some of our properties may be subject to regulations regarding the retirement and decommissioning or removal of long-lived assets includingbuildings containing hazardous materials, USTs and other equipment. Some of the properties may be adjacent to or near properties that have contained or currently contain USTs used to store petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances.In addition, certain of the properties are on, adjacent to, or near properties upon which others have engaged or may in the future engage in activities that may release petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. There may be otherenvironmental problems associated with our properties of which we are unaware. These problems may make it more difficult for us to re-let or sell our properties on favorable terms, or at all. For additional information with respect to pending environmental lawsuits and claims, environmental remediation costs andestimates, and Marketing and the Master Lease see Item 3. Legal Proceedings, Environmental Matters in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and notes 3and 6 in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements each of which is incorporated by reference herein. We enter into leases and various other agreements which allocate responsibility for known and unknown environmentalliabilities by establishing the percentage and method of allocating responsibility between the parties. Our tenants are directly responsible to pay for (i) remediation of environmental contamination they cause and compliance with variousenvironmental laws and regulations as the operators of our properties, and (ii) environmental liabilities allocated to them under the terms of our leases and various other agreements. Generally, the liability for the retirement anddecommissioning or removal of USTs and other equipment is the responsibility of our tenants. We are contingently liable for these obligations in the event that our tenants do not satisfy their responsibilities. A liability has not been accrued forobligations that are the responsibility of our tenants, other than the $47.9 million accrued in the fourth quarter of 2011 for the Marketing Environmental Liabilities, based on our tenants past histories of paying such obligations and/or ourassessment of their respective financial abilities to pay their share of such costs. However, there can be no assurance that our assessments are correct or that our tenants who have paid their obligations in the past will continue to do so. We cannot provide any assurance that the programs under which we are reimbursed from state UST remediationfunds will continue to be available to us. Environmental exposures are difficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons, including the extent of contamination, alternative treatment methods that may be applied, location of the property whichsubjects it to differing local laws and regulations and their interpretations, as well as the time it takes to remediate contamination. In developing our liability for estimated environmental remediation costs on a property by property basis, weconsider among other things, enacted laws and regulations, assessments of contamination and surrounding geology, quality of information available, currently available technologies for treatment, alternative methods of remediation and priorexperience. Environmental accruals are based on estimates which are subject to significant change, and are adjusted as the remediation treatment progresses, as circumstances change and as environmental contingencies become more clearly defined andreasonably estimable. Adjustments to accrued liabilities for environmental remediation costs will be reflected in our financial statements as they become probable and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.   17 Table of ContentsIt is possible that our assumptions regarding the ultimate allocationmethods and share of responsibility that we used to allocate environmental liabilities may change, which may result in adjustments to the amounts recorded for environmental litigation accruals and environmental remediation liabilities. We will berequired to accrue for environmental liabilities that we believe are allocable to others under various other agreements if we determine that it is probable that the counterparty will not meet its environmental obligations. We may ultimately beresponsible to pay for environmental liabilities as the property owner if the counterparty fails to pay them. We cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations may be enacted in the future, or if or how existing lawsor regulations will be administered or interpreted with respect to products or activities to which they have not previously been applied. We cannot predict whether state UST fund programs will be administered and funded in the future in a mannerthat is consistent with past practices and if future environmental spending will continue to be eligible for reimbursement at historical recovery rates under these programs. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as morevigorous enforcement policies of the regulatory agencies or stricter interpretation of existing laws which may develop in the future, could have an adverse effect on our financial position, or that of our tenants, and could require substantialadditional expenditures for future remediation.  As a result of the factors discussed above, or others,compliance with environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. We are defending pending lawsuits and claims and are subject to material losses. We are subject to various lawsuits and claims, including litigation related to environmental matters, such as thosearising from leaking USTs and releases of motor fuel into the environment, and toxic tort claims. The ultimate resolution of certain matters cannot be predicted because considerable uncertainty exists both in terms of the probability of loss and theestimate of such loss. Our ultimate liabilities resulting from such lawsuits and claims, if any, could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.For additional information with respect to pending environmental lawsuits and claims and environmental remediation costs and estimates see Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Environmental Matters in Item 7. ManagementsDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and notes 3 and 6 in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements each of which is incorporated byreference herein.  A significant portion of our properties are concentrated in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the UnitedStates, and adverse conditions in those regions, in particular, could negatively impact our operations. A significant portion of the properties we own and lease are located in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of theUnited States. Because of the concentration of our properties in those regions, in the event of adverse economic conditions in those regions, we would likely experience higher risk of default on payment of rent to us than if our properties were moregeographically diversified. Additionally, the rents on our properties may be subject to a greater risk of default than other properties in the event of adverse economic, political, or business developments or natural hazards that may affect theNortheast or Mid-Atlantic United States and the ability of our lessees to make rent payments. This lack of geographical diversification could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity,ability to pay dividends or stock price.  We are in a competitive business. The real estate industry is highly competitive. Where we own properties, we compete for tenants with a large number ofreal estate property owners and other companies that sublet properties. Our principal means of competition are rents we are able to charge in relation to the income producing potential of the location. In addition, we expect other major real estateinvestors, some with much greater financial resources or more experienced personnel than we have, will compete with us for attractive acquisition opportunities. These competitors include petroleum manufacturing, distributing and marketing companies,other REITs, investment banking firms and private institutional investors. This competition has increased prices for properties we seek to acquire and may impair our ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms in the future.  18 Table of ContentsWe are exposed to counterparty credit risk and there can be no assurances that we will effectivelymanage or mitigate this risk.  We regularly interact with counterparties in various industries. Thetypes of counterparties most common to our transactions and agreements include, but are not limited to, landlords, tenants, vendors and lenders. Our most significant counterparties include, but are not limited to the members of the Bank Syndicatethat are counterparties to our Amended Credit Agreement and the lender that is the counterparty to the Amended Term Loan Agreement. The default, insolvency or other inability of a significant counterparty to perform its obligations under anagreement or transaction, including, without limitation, as a result of the rejection of an agreement or transaction in bankruptcy proceedings, could have a material adverse effect on us. (For additional information, see Item 7.Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks.) We are subject to losses that may not be covered by insurance. Our tenants, as the lessees of our properties, are required to provide insurance for such properties, including casualty,liability, fire and extended coverage in amounts and on other terms as set forth in our leases. We do not maintain pollution legal liability insurance to protect us from potential future claims for environmental contamination, including theenvironmental liabilities that are the responsibility of our tenants. We carry insurance against certain risks and in such amounts as we believe are customary for businesses of our kind. However, as the costs and availability of insurance change, wemay decide not to be covered against certain losses (such as certain environmental liabilities, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and civil disorder) where, in the judgment of management, the insurance is not warranted due to cost or availability ofcoverage or the remoteness of perceived risk. There is no assurance that our insurance coverages are or will be sufficient to cover actual losses incurred. The destruction of, or significant damage to, or significant liabilities arising out ofconditions at, our properties due to an uninsured cause would result in an economic loss and could result in us losing both our investment in, and anticipated profits from, such properties. When a loss is insured, the coverage may be insufficient inamount or duration, or a lessees customers may be lost, such that the lessee cannot resume its business after the loss at prior levels or at all, resulting in reduced rent or a default under its lease. Any such loss relating to a large numberof properties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.  Failure to qualify as a REIT under the federal income tax laws would have adverse consequences to our shareholders. We elected to be treated as a REIT under the federal income tax laws beginning January 1, 2001. We cannot, however,guarantee that we will continue to qualify in the future as a REIT. We cannot give any assurance that new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the requirements relating to ourqualification. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing our taxable income and will again be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates, we could be subject tothe federal alternative minimum tax, we could be required to pay significant income taxes and we would have less money available for our operations and distributions to shareholders. This would likely have a significant adverse effect on the valueof our securities. We could also be precluded from treatment as a REIT for four taxable years following the year in which we lost the qualification, and all distributions to shareholders would be taxable as regular corporate dividends to the extentof our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Loss of our REIT status would result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, would prohibit us from drawing funds against the Amended Credit Agreement and could result in theacceleration of all of our indebtedness under our Amended Credit Agreement and Amended Term Loan Agreement which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends orstock price.  We are exposed to interest rate risk and there can be no assurances that we will manage or mitigate this risk effectively. We are exposed to interest rate risk, primarily as a result of our Amended Credit Agreement whichexpires in March 2013 and our Amended Term Loan Agreement which also expires in March 2013. Borrowings under our Amended Credit Agreement and our Amended Term Loan Agreement bear interest at a floating rate. Accordingly, an increase in interestrates will increase the amount of interest we must pay under our Amended Credit Agreement and our Amended Term Loan Agreement. Our interest rate risk may materially change in the future if we increase our borrowings under the Amended CreditAgreement, further amend our Amended Credit Agreement or Amended Term Loan Agreement, seek other sources of debt or equity capital or refinance our outstanding debt. A significant increase in interest rates could also make it more difficult to findalternative financing on desirable terms. (For additional information with respect to interest rate risk, see Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks.)   19 Table of ContentsWe may change our dividend policy and the dividends we pay may be subject to significant volatility. The decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future, as well as the timing,amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on such factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant. In addition, our Amended Credit Agreement and our Amended TermLoan Agreement prohibit the payments of dividends during certain events of default. No assurance can be given that our financial performance in the future will permit our payment of any dividends or that the amount of dividends we pay, if any, willnot fluctuate significantly.  Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, our ability to pay dividends wouldbe restricted if, after payment of the dividend, (1) we would not be able to pay indebtedness as it becomes due in the usual course of business or (2) our total assets would be less than the sum of our liabilities plus the amount thatwould be needed, if we were to be dissolved, to satisfy the rights of any shareholders with liquidation preferences. There currently are no shareholders with liquidation preferences. To qualify for taxation as a REIT, we, among other requirements, must distribute annually to our stockholders at least90% of our taxable income, including taxable income that is accrued by us without a corresponding receipt of cash. We cannot provide any assurance that our cash flows will permit us to continue paying cash dividends. The Internal Revenue Service(IRS) has allowed the use of a procedure, as a result of which we could satisfy the REIT income distribution requirement by making a distribution on our common stock comprised of (i) shares of our common stock having a value of upto 90% of the total distribution and (ii) cash in the remaining amount of the total distribution, in lieu of paying the distribution entirely in cash. The procedure will only apply to distributions made after 2011 to the extent that we properlyelect under applicable law to treat such distributions as made out of taxable income that arose in 2011. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to satisfy our REIT income distribution requirement with respect to taxable income arisingin 2012 and thereafter by making distributions payable in whole or in part in shares of our common stock. It is also possible that instead of distributing 100% of our taxable income on an annual basis, we may decide to retain a portion of ourtaxable income and to pay taxes on such amounts as permitted by the IRS. In the event that we pay a portion of a dividend in shares of our common stock, taxable U.S. shareholders would be required to pay tax on the entire amount of the dividend,including the portion paid in shares of common stock, in which case such shareholders might have to pay the tax using cash from other sources. If a U.S. shareholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the salesproceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our common stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to non-U. S. shareholders, we may be required to withhold U.S.tax with respect to such dividend, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock. In addition, if a significant number of our shareholders sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends,such sales would put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock.  As a result of the factorsdescribed above, we may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, revenues, operating expenses, results of operations,liquidity, ability to pay dividends or our stock price.  Changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of ourpublicly traded common stock.  As with other publicly traded securities, the market price of ourpublicly traded common stock depends on various market conditions, which may change from time-to-time. Among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded common stock are the following:     our financial condition and performance and that of our significant tenants;     the markets perception of our growth potential and potential future earnings;     the reputation of REITs generally and the reputation of REITs with portfolios similar to us;     the attractiveness of the securities of REITs in comparison to securities issued by other entities (including securities issued by other real estatecompanies);      an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid forpublicly traded securities;      the extent of institutional investor interest in us; and     general economic and financial market conditions.   20 Table of ContentsIn order to preserve our REIT status, our charter limits the number of shares a person may own, whichmay discourage a takeover that could result in a premium price for our common stock or otherwise benefit our stockholders.  Our charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Unless exemptedby our Board of Directors, no person may actually or constructively own more than 5% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding shares of our common stock or the outstanding shares of any class or series of ourpreferred stock, which may inhibit large investors from desiring to purchase our stock. This restriction may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tenderoffer, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets) that might provide a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders.  Maryland law may discourage a third-party from acquiring us.  We are subject to the provisions of Maryland Business Combination Act (the Business Combination Act) which prohibits transactions between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholderor an affiliate of an interested stockholder for 5 (five) years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Generally, pursuant to the Business Combination Act, an interestedstockholder is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of a Maryland corporations voting stock. These provisions could have the effect of delaying, preventing ordeterring a change in control of our company or reducing the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our capital stock. Additionally, the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act may deny voting rights toshares involved in an acquisition of one-tenth or more of the voting stock of a Maryland corporation. In our charter and bylaws, we have elected not to have the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act apply to any acquisition by any person of sharesof stock of our company. However, in the case of the control share acquisition statute, our Board of Directors may opt to make this statute applicable to us at any time by amending our bylaws, and may do so on a retroactive basis. Finally, theunsolicited takeovers provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law permit our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to implement certain provisionsthat may have the effect of inhibiting a third-party from making an acquisition proposal for our Company or of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our Company under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of ourcommon stocks with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price or that stockholders may otherwise believe is in their best interests.  Inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  Although inflation has not materially impacted our results of operations in the recent past, increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in thefuture and on our results of operations. During times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, as provided for in our leases, rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation. Likewise, even though our triple-net leases reduce ourexposure to rising property expenses due to inflation, substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue, which may adversely affectthe tenants ability to pay rent.  The loss of certain members of our management team could adversely affect our business. We depend upon the skills and experience of our executive officers. Loss of the services of any ofthem could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. Except for the employment agreement with our President and Chief Executive Officer, DavidDriscoll, we do not have employment agreements with any of our executives.  Amendments to the Accounting Standards Codification made bythe Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) or changes in accounting standards issued by other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability or financial position. Our financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification,which is periodically amended by the FASB. The application of GAAP is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, we are required to adopt amendments to the Accounting Standards Codification or comply with revised interpretationsthat are issued from time-to-time by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB and the SEC. Those changes could adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability or financial position.   21 Table of ContentsTerrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the market on which our common stocktrades, the markets in which we operate, our operations and our results of operations.  Terroristattacks or other acts of violence or war could affect our business or the businesses of our tenants. The consequences of armed conflicts are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us.More generally, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States and worldwide financial markets and economy. Terrorist attacks also could be a factor resulting in,or a continuation of, an economic recession in the United States or abroad. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stockprice"
10,GTY,GETTY REALTY CORP,2011-03-16,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
     We are subject to various risks, many of which are beyond our control. As a result of theseand other factors, we may experience material fluctuations in our future operating results on aquarterly or annual basis, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financialcondition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. An investmentin our stock involves various risks, including those mentioned below and elsewhere this AnnualReport on Form 10-K and those that are described from time to time in our other filings with theSEC.7Table of ContentsOur financial results are materially dependent on the performance of Marketing. In the event thatMarketing does not perform its rental, environmental or other obligations under the MarketingLeases, our business, financial condition, revenues, operating expenses, results of operations,liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price could be materially adversely affected. Thefinancial performance of Marketing has deteriorated in recent years.     Our financial results are materially dependent upon the ability of Marketing to meet itsrental, environmental and other obligations under the Marketing Leases. A substantial portion ofour revenues (66% for the year ended December 31, 2010) are derived from the Marketing Leases.Accordingly, any factor that adversely affects Marketings ability to meet its rental,environmental and other obligations under the Marketing Leases may have a material adverse effecton our business, financial condition, revenues, operating expenses, results of operations,liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. For additional information regarding theportion of our financial results that are attributable to Marketing, see Note 11 in Item 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.     As of the date of this Form 10-K, we have not yet received Marketings unaudited consolidatedfinancial statements for the year ended December 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2009,Marketing reported a significant loss, continuing a trend of reporting large losses in recentyears.  Based on the interim reports we have received through 2010, Marketings significantlosses have continued. As a result of Marketings significant losses, including the losses reportedto us subsequent to Marketings reorganization in 2009 (discussed in more detail below) and thecumulative impact of those losses on Marketings financial position as of September 30, 2010, wecontinue to believe that Marketing likely does not have the ability to generate cash flows from itsbusiness operations sufficient to meet its rental, environmental and other obligations under theterms of the Marketing Leases unless Marketing shows significant improvement in its financialresults, reduces the number of properties under the Marketing Leases, or receives additionalcapital or credit support. There can be no assurance that Marketing will be successful in any ofthese efforts. It is also possible that the deterioration of Marketings financial condition maycontinue or that Marketing may file bankruptcy and seek to reorganize or liquidate its business. Itis possible that Marketing may aggressively pursue seeking a modification of the Marketing Leases,including, removal of properties from the Marketing Leases, or a reduction in the rental paymentsowed by Marketing under the Marketing Lease.     As of December 31, 2010, the net carrying value of the deferred rent receivable attributableto the Marketing Leases was $21.2 million and the aggregate Marketing Environmental Liabilities (asdefined below), net of expected recoveries from underground storage tank funds, for which we mayultimately be responsible to pay but have not accrued range between $13 million and $20 million.The actual amount of the Marketing Environmental Liabilities may differ from our estimated range andwe can provide no assurance as to the accuracy of our estimate.  Although our 2010 financial statements were not  affected by the transfer of Lukoilsownership interest in Marketing to Cambridge, our estimates, judgments, assumptions and beliefsregarding Marketing and the Marketing Leases made effective December 31, 2010 are subject toreevaluation and possible change as we develop a greater understanding of factors relating to thenew ownership and management of Marketing, Marketings business plan and strategies and its capitalresources. It is possible that we may be required to increase or decrease the deferred rentreserve, record additional impairment charges related to the properties, or accrue for MarketingEnvironmental Liabilities as a result of changes in our estimates, judgments, assumptions andbeliefs regarding Marketing and the Marketing Leases that affect the amounts reported in ourfinancial statements. It is possible also  that as a result of material adjustments to the amountsrecorded for certain of our assets and liabilities that we may not be in compliance with thefinancial covenants in our Credit Agreement or Term Loan Agreement.     If Marketing does not meet its rental, environmental and other obligations under the MarketingLeases, our business, financial condition, revenues, operating expenses, results of operations,liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price may be materially adversely affected.Lukoil transferred its ownership interest in Marketing. We cannot predict what impact such transferwill have on Marketings ability or willingness to perform its rental, environmental and otherobligations under the Master Lease and on our business.     On February 28, 2011, Lukoil, one of the largest integrated Russian oil companies, transferredits ownership interest in Marketing to Cambridge. We are not privy to the terms and conditionspertaining to this transaction between Lukoil and Cambridge. In connection with the transfer, we donot know what type or amount of consideration, if any, was paid or is payable by Lukoil or itssubsidiaries to Cambridge, or by Cambridge to Lukoil or its subsidiaries. We do not know if thereare  any ongoing contractual or business relationships between Lukoil or its subsidiaries oraffiliates and Cambridge or its subsidiaries or affiliates, including Marketing. We have commenceddiscussions  with the new owners and management of Marketing, however, we cannot predict the impactthe transfer of Marketing may have on our business.8Table of Contents     While Lukoil had provided capital to Marketing in the past, there can be no assurance thatCambridge will provide financial support or will have the capacity to provide capital or financialsupport to Marketing in the future. It is possible that Marketing may file for bankruptcyprotection and seek to reorganize or liquidate its business. It is also possible that Marketing maytake other actions such as aggressively seeking to modify the terms of the Marketing Leases. Wecannot predict what impact Lukoils transfer of its ownership interest to Cambridge will have onMarketings ability and willingness to perform its rental, environmental and other obligationsunder the Marketing Leases. If Marketing does not meet its rental, environmental and otherobligations under the Marketing Leases, our business, financial condition, revenues, operatingexpenses, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price may bematerially adversely affected. It is possible that we may be required to increase or decrease thedeferred rent receivable reserve, record additional impairment charges related to our properties,or accrue for environmental liabilities as a result of the potential or actual filing forbankruptcy protection by Marketing or any potential or actual modification or termination of theMarketing Leases. It is possible that as a result of material adjustments to the amounts recordedfor certain of our assets and liabilities that we may not be in compliance with the financialcovenants in our Credit Agreement or Term Loan Agreement.We cannot predict what impact Marketings restructuring, dispute with Bionol and other changes inits business model will have on us.     In November 2009, Marketing announced a restructuring of its business. Marketing disclosedthat the restructuring included the sale of all assets unrelated to the properties it leases fromus, the elimination of parent-guaranteed debt, and steps to reduce operating costs. AlthoughMarketings press release stated that its restructuring included the sale of all assets unrelatedto the properties it leases from us, we have concluded, based on the press releases related to theMarketing/Bionol contract dispute described below, that Marketings restructuring did not includethe sale of all assets unrelated to the properties it leases from us. Marketing sold certain assetsunrelated to the properties it leases from us to its affiliates, LUKOIL Pan Americas LLC and LUKOILNorth America LLC. We believe that Marketing retained other assets, liabilities and businessmatters unrelated to the properties it leases from us. As part of the restructuring, Marketing paidoff debt which had been guaranteed or held by Lukoil with proceeds from the sale of assets toLukoil affiliates.     In June 2010, Marketing and Bionol Clearfield LLC (Bionol) each issued press releasesregarding a significant contractual dispute between them. Bionol owns and operates an ethanol plantin Pennsylvania. Bionol and Marketing entered into a five-year contract under which Marketingagreed to purchase substantially all of the ethanol production from the Bionol plant, atformula-based prices. Bionol stated that Marketing breached the contract by not paying theagreed-upon price for the ethanol. According to Bionols press release, the cumulative grosspurchase commitment under the contract could be on the order of one billion dollars. Marketingstated in its press release that it continues to pay Bionol millions of dollars each month for theethanol, withholding only the amount of the purchase price in dispute and that it has filed forarbitration to resolve the dispute. Among other items related to this matter, we do not know: (i)the accuracy of the statements made by Marketing and Bionol when made or if such statements reflectthe current status of the dispute; (ii) the cumulative or projected amount of the purchase price indispute and how Marketing has accounted for the ethanol contract in its financial statements; or(iii) how the formula-based price compares to the market price of ethanol. We cannot predict howthe ultimate resolution of this matter may impact Marketings long-term financial performance andits ability to meet its rental, environmental and other obligations to us as they become due underthe terms of the Marketing Leases.     We cannot predict what impact Marketings restructuring, dispute with Bionol or other changesin its business model will have on us. If Marketing does not meet its rental, environmental andother obligations under the Marketing Leases, our business, financial condition, revenues,operating expenses, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price maybe materially adversely affected.If it becomes probable that Marketing will not pay its environmental obligations, or if we changeour assumptions for environmental liabilities related to the Marketing Leases we would be indefault of our Credit Agreement or Term Loan Agreement, our business, financial condition, revenues, operating expenses,results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price could be materiallyadversely affected.     Marketing is directly responsible to pay for (i) remediation of environmentalcontamination it causes and compliance with various environmental laws and regulations as theoperator of our properties, and (ii) known and unknown environmental liabilities allocated toMarketing under the terms of the Marketing Leases and various other agreements with us relating toMarketings business and theproperties it leases from us (collectively the Marketing Environmental Liabilities).However, we continue to have ongoing environmental remediation obligations at 186 retail sites andfor certain pre-existing conditions9Table of Contentsat six of the terminals we lease to Marketing. If Marketing fails to pay the MarketingEnvironmental Liabilities, we may ultimately be responsible to pay for Marketing EnvironmentalLiabilities as the property owner. We do not maintain pollution legal liability insurance toprotect us from potential future claims for Marketing Environmental Liabilities. We will berequired to accrue for Marketing Environmental Liabilities if we determine that it is probable thatMarketing will not meet its environmental obligations and we can reasonably estimate the amount ofthe Marketing Environmental Liabilities for which we will be responsible to pay, or if ourassumptions regarding the ultimate allocation methods or share of responsibility that we used toallocate environmental liabilities changes. However, we continue to believe that it is not probablethat Marketing will not pay for substantially all of the Marketing Environmental Liabilities.Accordingly, we have not accrued for the Marketing Environmental Liabilities. Nonetheless, we havedetermined that the aggregate amount of the Marketing Environmental Liabilities (as estimated byus) would be material to us if we were required to accrue for all of the Marketing EnvironmentalLiabilities since as a result of such accrual,  we would not be in compliance with theexisting financial covenants in our Credit Agreement and our Term Loan Agreement. Suchnon-compliance would result in an event of default under the Credit Agreement and the Term LoanAgreement which, if not waived, would prohibit us from drawing fundsagainst the Credit Agreementand could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness under such agreements. It ispossible that we may change our estimates, judgments, assumptions and beliefs regarding Marketingand the Marketing Leases, and accordingly, we may be required to accrue for Marketing EnvironmentalLiabilities. If we determine that it is probable that Marketing will not meet the MarketingEnvironmental Liabilities and we accrue for such liabilities, our business, financial condition,revenues, operating expenses, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stockprice may be materially adversely affected.     We estimate that, the aggregate Marketing Environmental Liabilities, net of expectedrecoveries from underground storage tank funds, for which we may ultimately be responsible to payrange between $13 million and $20 million, of which between $6 million and $9 million relate to theproperties that we identified as the basis for our estimate of the deferred rent receivablereserve. Since we generally do not have access to certain site specific information available toMarketing, which is the party responsible for paying and managing its environmental remediationexpenses at our properties, our estimates were developed in large part by review of the limitedpublically available information gathered through electronic databases and freedom of informationrequests and assumptions we made based on that data and on our own experiences with environmentalremediation matters. The actual amounts of the ranges estimated above may differ materially from our estimates andwe can provide no assurance as to the accuracy of these estimates.If the Marketing Leases are modified significantly or terminated, our business, financialcondition, revenues, operating expenses, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividendsor stock price could be materially adversely affected.     From time to time when it was owned by Lukoil, we held discussions with representatives ofMarketing regarding potential modifications to the Marketing Leases. These discussions did notresult in a common understanding with Marketing that would form a basis for modification of theMarketing Leases. We have recently initiated discussions with the new owners and management ofMarketing, subsequent to Lukoils transfer of its ownership interest in Marketing to Cambridge. Itis possible that the new management of Marketing may aggressively seek to modify the terms of theMarketing Leases or seek to remove a substantial number of properties from the Marketing Leases. Weintend to continue to pursue the removal of individual properties from the Marketing Leases, and weremain open to removal of groups of properties; however, there is no agreement in place providingfor removal of properties from the Marketing Leases. If Marketing ultimately determines that itsbusiness strategy is to exit all or a portion of the properties it leases from us, it is ourintention to cooperate with Marketing in accomplishing those objectives if we determine that it isprudent for us to do so. Any modification of the Marketing Leases that removes a significant numberof properties from the Marketing Leases would likely significantly reduce the amount of rent wereceive from Marketing and increase our operating expenses. We cannot accurately predict if, orwhen, the Marketing Leases will be modified; what composition of properties, if any, may be removedfrom the Marketing Leases as part of any such modification; or what the terms of any agreement formodification of the Marketing Leases may be. We also cannot accurately predict what actionsMarketing may take, and what our recourse may be, whether the Marketing Leases are modified or not.We may be required to increase or decrease the deferred rent receivable reserve, record additionalimpairment charges related to our properties, or accrue for environmental liabilities as a resultof the potential or actual modification or termination of the Marketing Leases.     As permitted under the terms of the Marketing Leases, Marketing generally can, subject to anycontrary terms under applicable third party leases, use each property for any lawful purpose, orfor no purpose whatsoever. We believe that as of10Table of ContentsMarch 16, 2011, Marketing was not operating any of the nine terminals it leases from us andhad removed, or has scheduled removal of, the underground gasoline storage tanks and relatedequipment at approximately 140 of our retail properties and we also believe that most of theseproperties are either vacant or provide negative contribution to Marketings results. In thoseinstances where we determine that the best use for a property is no longer as a retail motor fueloutlet, at the appropriate time we will seek an alternative tenant or buyer for such property. Withrespect to properties that are vacant or have had underground gasoline storage tanks and relatedequipment removed, it may be more difficult or costly to re-let or sell such properties as gasstations because of capital costs or possible zoning or permitting rights that are required andthat may have lapsed during the period since gasoline was last sold at the property.     We intend either to re-let or sell any properties that are removed from the Marketing Leases,whether such removal arises consensually by negotiation or as a result of default by Marketing, andreinvest any realized sales proceeds in new properties. We intend to offer properties removed fromthe Marketing Leases to replacement tenants or buyers individually, or in groups of properties, orby seeking a single tenant for the entire portfolio of properties subject to the Marketing Leases.In the event that properties are removed from the Marketing Leases, we cannot accurately predictif, when, or on what terms such properties could be re-let or sold. If the Marketing Leases aresignificantly modified or terminated, our business, financial condition, revenues, operatingexpenses, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price may bematerially adversely affected.Although we periodically receive and review the unaudited financial statements and other financialinformation from Marketing, this information is not publicly available to investors. You will nothave access to financial information about Marketing provided to us by Marketing to allow you toindependently assess Marketings financial condition or its ability to satisfy its rental,environmental and other obligations under the Marketing Leases.     We periodically receive and review Marketings unaudited financial statements and otherfinancial information that we receive from Marketing pursuant to the terms of the Marketing Leases.However, the financial statements and other financial information are not publicly available toinvestors and Marketing contends that the terms of the Marketing Leases prohibit us from includingthe financial statements and other financial information in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, ourQuarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or in our Annual Reports to Shareholders. The Marketing Leasesprovide that Marketings financial information which is not publicly available shall be deliveredto us within one hundred fifty days after the end of each fiscal year. As of the date of this Form10-K, we have not yet received Marketings unaudited consolidated financial statements for the yearended December 31, 2010. The financial statements and other financial information that we receivefrom Marketing is unaudited and neither we, nor our auditors, have been involved with itspreparation and as a result have no assurance as to its correctness or completeness. You will nothave access to financial statements and other financial information about Marketing provided to usby Marketing to allow you to independently assess Marketings financial condition or its ability tosatisfy its rental, environmental and other obligations under the Marketing Leases, which may putyour investment in us at greater risk of loss.Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financialposition and results of operations, and they require management to make estimates, judgments andassumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain.     Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financialposition and results of operations. We have identified several accounting policies as beingcritical to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations because theyrequire management to make particularly subjective or complex judgments about matters that areinherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would berecorded under different conditions or using different assumptions. Because of the inherentuncertainty of the estimates, judgments and assumptions associated with these critical accountingpolicies, we cannot provide any assurance that we will not make subsequent significant adjustmentsto our consolidated financial statements. Estimates, judgments and assumptions underlying ourconsolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, deferred rent receivable, incomeunder direct financing leases, recoveries from state UST funds, environmental remediation costs,real estate including impairment charges related to the reduction in market value of our realestate, depreciation and amortization, impairment of long-lived assets, litigation, accruedexpenses, income taxes and the allocation of the purchase price of properties acquired to theassets acquired and liabilities assumed.     For example, we have made judgments regarding the level of environmental reserves and reservesfor our deferred rent receivable relating to Marketing and the Marketing Leases and leases with ourother tenants. As of December 31, 2010, the11Table of Contentsnet carrying value of the deferred rent receivable attributable to the Marketing Leases was$21.2 million and the aggregate Marketing Environmental Liabilities, net of expected recoveries fromunderground storage tank funds, for which we may ultimately be responsible to pay but not haveaccrued range between $13 million and $20 million. The actual amount of the Marketing Environmental Liabilities may differ from our estimated range andwe can provide no assurance as to the accuracy of our estimate. Although our 2010 financial statements were not affected by the transfer of Lukoils ownership interest in Marketing to Cambridge, ourestimates, judgments, assumptions and beliefs regarding Marketing and the Marketing Leases madeeffective December 31, 2010 are subject to reevaluation and possible change as we develop a greaterunderstanding of factors relating to the new ownership and management of Marketing, Marketingsbusiness plans, strategies, operating results and its capital resources. It is possible that we maybe required to increase or decrease our deferred rent receivable reserve, record additionalimpairment charges related to our properties, or accrue for Marketing Environmental Liabilities asa result of changes in our estimates, judgments, assumptions and beliefs regarding Marketing andthe Marketing Leases that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements. It is possiblethat as a result of material adjustments to the amounts recorded for certain of our assets andliabilities that we may not be in compliance with the financial covenants in our Credit Agreement or Term Loan Agreement.     If our judgments, assumptions and allocations prove to be incorrect, or if circumstanceschange, our business, financial condition, revenues, operating expense, results of operations,liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price may be materially adversely affected. (Forinformation regarding our critical accounting policies, see Item 7. Managements Discussion andAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Critical Accounting Policies.)We may acquire or develop new properties, and this may create risks.     We may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate companies when we believethat an acquisition or development matches our business strategies. These properties may havecharacteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenuepotential. It is possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline after weacquire them, they may not perform as expected and, if financed using debt or new equity issuances,may result in shareholder dilution. Our acquisitions of new properties will also expose us to theliabilities of those properties, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition.We face competition in pursuing these acquisitions and we may not succeed in leasing newlydeveloped or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover their costs of acquisition ordevelopment and operations. Newly acquired properties may require significant management attentionthat would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. We may not succeed in consummating desiredacquisitions or in completing developments on time or within our budget. Consequences arising fromor in connection with any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business,financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.While we seek to grow through accretive acquisitions, acquisitions of properties may be dilutiveand may not produce the returns that we expect and we may not be able to successfully integrateacquired properties into our portfolio or manage our growth effectively, which could have amaterial adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects.     One or more acquisition of properties may initially be dilutive to our net income, andacquired properties may not perform as we expect or produce the returns that we anticipate(including, without limitation, as a result of tenant bankruptcies, tenant concessions, ourinability to collect rents and higher than anticipated operating expenses). Further, we may notsuccessfully integrate one or more of these property acquisitions into our existing portfoliowithout operating disruptions or unanticipated costs. Additionally, as we increase the size of ourportfolio, we may not be able to adapt our management, administrative, accounting and operationalsystems, or hire and retain sufficient operational staff to integrate acquired properties into ourportfolio or manage any future acquisitions of properties without operating disruptions orunanticipated costs. Moreover, the continued growth of our portfolio will require increasedinvestment in management personnel, professional fees, other personnel, financial and managementsystems and controls and facilities, which will result in additional operating expenses. Under thecircumstances described above, our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospectsmay be materially and adversely affected.We are subject to risks inherent in owning and leasing real estate.     We are subject to varying degrees of risk generally related to leasing and owning real estatemany of which are beyond our control. In addition to general risks related to owning propertiesused in the petroleum marketing industry, our risks include, among others:12Table of Contents our liability as a lessee for long-term lease obligations regardless of our revenues,  deterioration in national, regional and local economic and real estate market conditions,  potential changes in supply of, or demand for, rental properties similar to ours,  competition for tenants and declining rental rates,  difficulty in selling or re-letting properties on favorable terms or at all,  impairments in our ability to collect rent payments when due,  increases in interest rates and adverse changes in the availability, cost and terms offinancing,  the potential for uninsured casualty and other losses due to natural disasters or othercauses,  the impact of present or future environmental legislation and compliance with environmentallaws,  adverse changes in zoning laws and other regulations, and  acts of terrorism and war.     Each of these factors could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. In addition,real estate investments are relatively illiquid, which means that our ability to vary our portfolioof properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be limited.Adverse developments in general business, economic, or political conditions could have a materialadverse effect on us.     Adverse developments in general business and economic conditions, including through recession,downturn or otherwise, either in the economy generally or in those regions in which a large portionof our business is conducted, could have a material adverse effect on us and significantly increasecertain of the risks we are subject to. The general economic conditions in the United States are,and for an extended period of time may be, significantly less favorable than that of prior years.Among other effects, adverse economic conditions could depress real estate values, impact ourability to re-let or sell our properties and have an adverse effect on our tenants level of salesand financial performance generally. Our revenues are dependent on the economic success of ourtenants and any factors that adversely impact our tenants could also have a material adverse effecton our business, financial condition and results of operations liquidity, ability to pay dividendsor stock price.Substantially all of our tenants depend on the same industry for their revenues.     We derive substantially all of our revenues from leasing, primarily on a triple-net basis,retail motor fuel and convenience store properties and petroleum distribution terminals to tenantsin the petroleum marketing industry. Accordingly, our revenues will be dependent on the economicsuccess of the petroleum marketing industry, and any factors that adversely affect that industry,such as disruption in the supply of petroleum or a  decrease in the demand for conventional motor fuels due to conservation, technological advancements in petroleum-fueled motor vehicles, or an increase inthe use of alternative fuel vehicles, or green technology could also have a material adverse effect on our business,financial condition and results of operations liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.The success of participants in the petroleum marketing industry depends upon the sale of refinedpetroleum products at margins in excess of fixed and variable expenses. The petroleum marketingindustry is highly competitive and volatile. Petroleum products are commodities, the prices ofwhich depend on numerous factors that affect supply and demand. The prices paid by our tenants andother petroleum marketers for products are affected by global, national and regional factors. Alarge, rapid increase in wholesale petroleum prices would adversely affect the profitability andcash flows of our tenants if the increased cost of petroleum products could not be passed on totheir customers or if automobile consumption of gasoline was to decline significantly. We cannot be certain how these factors will affectpetroleum product prices or supply in the future, or how in particular they will affect ourtenants.13Table of ContentsOur future cash flow is dependent on the performance of our tenants of their lease obligations,renewal of existing leases and either re-letting or selling our vacant properties.     We are subject to risks that financial distress, default or bankruptcy of our existing tenantsmay lead to vacancy at our properties or disruption in rent receipts as a result of partial paymentor nonpayment of rent or that expiring leases may not be renewed. Under unfavorable generaleconomic conditions, there can be no assurance that our tenants level of sales and financialperformance generally will not be adversely affected, which in turn, could impact the reliabilityof our rent receipts. We are subject to risks that the terms governing renewal or re-letting of ourproperties (including the cost of required renovations, replacement of gasoline tanks and relatedequipment or environmental remediation) may be less favorable than current lease terms, or that thevalues of our properties that we sell may be adversely affected by unfavorable general economicconditions. Unfavorable general economic conditions may also negatively impact our ability tore-let or sell our properties. Numerous properties compete with our properties in attractingtenants to lease space. The number of available or competitive properties in a particular areacould have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease or sell our properties and on therents we are able to charge. In addition to the risk of disruption in rent receipts, we are subjectto the risk of incurring real estate taxes, maintenance, environmental and other expenses at vacantproperties.     The financial distress, default or bankruptcy of our tenants may also lead to protracted andexpensive processes for retaking control of our properties than would otherwise be the case,including, eviction or other legal proceedings related to or resulting from the tenants default.These risks are greater with respect to certain of our tenants who lease multiple properties fromus, such as Marketing. It is possible that Marketing may file for bankruptcy protection and seek toreorganize or liquidate its business. (For additional information regarding the portion of ourfinancial results that are attributable to Marketing, see Note 11 in Item 8. Financial Statementsand Supplementary Data  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional informationwith respect to concentration of tenant risk, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis ofFinancial Condition and Results of Operations  General  Marketing and the Marketing Leases.)If a tenant files for bankruptcy protection it is possible that we would recover substantially lessthan the full value of our claims against the tenant.     If our tenants do not perform their lease obligations; or we are unable to renew existingleases and promptly recapture and re-let or sell vacant locations; or if lease terms upon renewalor re-letting are less favorable than current lease terms; or if the values of properties that wesell are adversely affected by market conditions; or if we incur significant costs or disruptionrelated to or resulting from tenant financial distress, default or bankruptcy; then our cash flowcould be significantly adversely affected.Property taxes on our properties may increase without notice.     Each of the properties we own or lease is subject to real property taxes. The leases forcertain of the properties that we lease from third parties obligate us to pay real property taxeswith regard to those properties. The real property taxes on our properties and any other propertiesthat we develop, acquire or lease in the future may increase as property tax rates change and asthose properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities. To the extent that our tenants areunable or unwilling to pay such increase in accordance with their leases, our net operatingexpenses may increase.We incur significant operating costs as a result of environmental laws and regulations which costscould significantly rise and reduce our profitability.     We are subject to numerous existing federal, state and local laws and regulations, includingmatters relating to the protection of the environment. Under certain environmental laws, a currentor previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from thepresence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at, on, or under, suchproperty, and may be required to investigate and clean-up such contamination. Such laws typicallyimpose liability and clean-up responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator knewof or caused the presence of the contaminants, or the timing or cause of the contamination, and theliability under such laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisibleand there is a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility. For example, liability may ariseas a result of the historical use of a property or from the migration of contamination fromadjacent or nearby properties. Any such contamination or liability may also reduce the value of theproperty. In addition, the owner or operator of a property may be subject to claims by thirdparties based on injury, damage and/or costs, including investigation and clean-up costs, resultingfrom environmental contamination present at or emanating from a property. The properties owned orcontrolled by us are leased primarily as retail motor fuel and convenience store properties, andtherefore may14Table of Contentscontain, or may have contained, USTs for the storage of petroleum products and other hazardousor toxic substances, which creates a potential for the release of such products or substances. Someof our properties may be subject to regulations regarding the retirement and decommissioning orremoval of long-lived assets including buildings containing hazardous materials, USTs and otherequipment. Some of the properties may be adjacent to or near properties that have contained orcurrently contain USTs used to store petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. Inaddition, certain of the properties are on, adjacent to, or near properties upon which others haveengaged or may in the future engage in activities that may release petroleum products or otherhazardous or toxic substances. There may be other environmental problems associated with ourproperties of which we are unaware. These problems may make it more difficult for us to re-let orsell our properties on favorable terms, or at all.     For additional information with respect to pending environmental lawsuits and claims,environmental remediation costs and estimates, and Marketing and the Marketing Leases see Item 3.Legal Proceedings, Environmental Matters and General  Marketing and the Marketing Leases inItem 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations andNote 5 in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements each of which is incorporated by reference herein.     We enter into leases and various other agreements which allocate responsibility for known andunknown environmental liabilities by establishing the percentage and method of allocatingresponsibility between the parties. Our tenants are directly responsible to pay for (i) remediationof environmental contamination they cause and compliance with various environmental laws andregulations as the operators of our properties, and (ii) environmental liabilities allocated tothem under the terms of our leases and various other agreements. Generally, the liability for theretirement and decommissioning or removal of USTs and other equipment is the responsibility of ourtenants. We are contingently liable for these obligations in the event that our tenants do notsatisfy their responsibilities. A liability has not been accrued for obligations that are theresponsibility of our tenants based on our tenants past histories of paying such obligationsand/or our assessment of their respective financial abilities to pay their share of such costs.However, there can be no assurance that our assessments are correct or that our tenants who havepaid their obligations in the past will continue to do so.     As of December 31, 2010, we had accrued $10.9 million as managements best estimate of the netfair value of reasonably estimable environmental remediation costs which was comprised of $14.9million of estimated environmental obligations and liabilities offset by $4.0 million of estimatedrecoveries from state UST remediation funds, net of allowance. Environmental exposures aredifficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons, including the extent of contamination,alternative treatment methods that may be applied, location of the property which subjects it todiffering local laws and regulations and their interpretations, as well as the time it takes toremediate contamination. In developing our liability for probable and reasonably estimableenvironmental remediation costs on a property by property basis, we consider among other things,enacted laws and regulations, assessments of contamination and surrounding geology, quality ofinformation available, currently available technologies for treatment, alternative methods ofremediation and prior experience. Environmental accruals are based on estimates which are subjectto significant change, and are adjusted as the remediation treatment progresses, as circumstanceschange and as environmental contingencies become more clearly defined and reasonably estimable.Adjustments to accrued liabilities for environmental remediation costs will be reflected in ourfinancial statements as they become probable and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.     We have not accrued for approximately $1.0 million in costs incurred by the current propertyowner in connection with removal of USTs and soil remediation at a property that was leased to andoperated by Marketing. We believe that Marketing is responsible for such costs under the terms ofthe Master Lease, and on that basis we tendered the matter to Marketing for defense andindemnification, but Marketing denied its liability for claims and its responsibility to defend andindemnify us. We were sued by the current property owner and filed third party claims againstMarketing for indemnification. The property owners claim for reimbursement of costs incurred andour claim for indemnification from Marketing were actively litigated leading to a trial held beforea judge. The trial court issued its decision in August 2009 under which the company and Marketingwere held jointly and severally responsible to the current property owner for the costs incurred bythe owner to remove USTs and remediate contamination at the site, but, as between the company andMarketing, Marketing was held accountable for such costs under the indemnification provisions ofthe Master Lease. Marketing has appealed the decision; however, we believe the probability that thetrial court decision will be reversed or remanded and that Marketing will not ultimately be heldresponsible for the clean-up costs incurred by the current property owner is remote.     It is possible that our assumptions regarding the ultimate allocation methods and share ofresponsibility that we used to allocate environmental liabilities may change, which may result inadjustments to the amounts recorded for environmental15Table of Contentslitigation accruals, environmental remediation liabilities and related assets. We will berequired to accrue for environmental liabilities that we believe are allocable to others undervarious other agreements if we determine that it is probable that the counter-party will not meetits environmental obligations. We may ultimately be responsible to pay for environmentalliabilities as the property owner if the counterparty fails to pay them.     We cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations may be enacted in the future,or if or how existing laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted with respect toproducts or activities to which they have not previously been applied. We cannot predict whetherstate UST fund programs will be administered and funded in the future in a manner that isconsistent with past practices and if future environmental spending will continue to be eligiblefor reimbursement at historical recovery rates under these programs. Compliance with more stringentlaws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of the regulatory agencies orstricter interpretation of existing laws which may develop in the future, could have an adverseeffect on our financial position, or that of our tenants, and could require substantial additionalexpenditures for future remediation.     As a result of the factors discussed above, or others, compliance with environmental laws andregulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results ofoperations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.We are defending pending lawsuits and claims and are subject to material losses.     We are subject to various lawsuits and claims, including litigation related to environmentalmatters, such as those arising from leaking USTs and releases of motor fuel into the environment,and toxic tort claims. The ultimate resolution of certain matters cannot be predicted becauseconsiderable uncertainty exists both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimate of suchloss. Our ultimate liabilities resulting from such lawsuits and claims, if any, could cause amaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity,ability to pay dividends or stock price. For additional information with respect to pendingenvironmental lawsuits and claims and environmental remediation costs and estimates see Item 3.Legal Proceedings and Environmental Matters in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis ofFinancial Condition and Results of Operations and Notes 3 and 5 in Item 8. Financial Statementsand Supplementary Data  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements each of which is incorporatedby reference herein.A significant portion of our properties are concentrated in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regionsof the United States, and adverse conditions in those regions, in particular, could negativelyimpact our operations.     A significant portion of the properties we own and lease are located in the Northeast andMid-Atlantic regions of the United States. Because of the concentration of our properties in thoseregions, in the event of adverse economic conditions in those regions, we would likely experiencehigher risk of default on payment of rent to us (including under the Marketing Leases) than if ourproperties were more geographically diversified. Additionally, the rents on our properties may besubject to a greater risk of default than other properties in the event of adverse economic,political, or business developments or natural hazards that may affect the Northeast orMid-Atlantic United States and the ability of our lessees to make rent payments. This lack ofgeographical diversification could have a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.We are in a competitive business.     The real estate industry is highly competitive. Where we own properties, we compete fortenants with a large number of real estate property owners and other companies that subletproperties. Our principal means of competition are rents we are able to charge in relation to theincome producing potential of the location. In addition, we expect other major real estateinvestors, some with much greater financial resources or more experienced personnel than we have,will compete with us for attractive acquisition opportunities. These competitors include petroleummanufacturing, distributing and marketing companies, other REITs, investment banking firms andprivate institutional investors. This competition has increased prices for properties we seek toacquire and may impair our ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms in thefuture.16Table of ContentsWe are exposed to counterparty credit risk and there can be no assurances that we will effectivelymanage or mitigate this risk .     We regularly interact with counterparties in various industries. The types of counterpartiesmost common to our transactions and agreements include, but are not limited to, landlords, tenants,vendors and lenders. Our most significant counterparties include, but are not limited to, Marketingas our primary tenant, the members of the Bank Syndicate that are counterparties to our CreditAgreement as our primary source of financing and JPMorgan Chase as the counterparty to our interestrate Swap Agreement. The default, insolvency or other inability of a significant counterparty toperform its obligations under an agreement or transaction, including, without limitation, as aresult of the rejection of an agreement or transaction in bankruptcy proceedings, could have amaterial adverse effect on us. (For additional information with respect to, and definitions of, theBank Syndicate, the Credit Agreement and the Swap Agreement, see Item 7. Managements Discussionand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resourcesand Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks.)We are subject to losses that may not be covered by insurance.     Marketing, and other tenants, as the lessees of our properties, are required to provideinsurance for such properties, including casualty, liability, fire and extended coverage in amountsand on other terms as set forth in our leases. We do not maintain pollution legal liabilityinsurance to protect the Company from potential future claims for environmental contamination,including the environmental liabilities that are the responsibility of our tenants. We carryinsurance against certain risks and in such amounts as we believe are customary for businesses ofour kind. However, as the costs and availability of insurance change, we may decide not to becovered against certain losses (such as certain environmental liabilities, earthquakes, hurricanes,floods and civil disorder) where, in the judgment of management, the insurance is not warranted dueto cost or availability of coverage or the remoteness of perceived risk. There is no assurance thatour insurance coverages are or will be sufficient to cover actual losses incurred. The destructionof, or significant damage to, or significant liabilities arising out of conditions at, ourproperties due to an uninsured cause would result in an economic loss and could result in us losingboth our investment in, and anticipated profits from, such properties. When a loss is insured, thecoverage may be insufficient in amount or duration, or a lessees customers may be lost, such thatthe lessee cannot resume its business after the loss at prior levels or at all, resulting inreduced rent or a default under its lease. Any such loss relating to a large number of propertiescould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations,liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.Failure to qualify as a REIT under the federal income tax laws would have adverse consequences toour shareholders.     We elected to be treated as a REIT under the federal income tax laws beginning January 1,2001. We cannot, however, guarantee that we will continue to qualify in the future as a REIT. Wecannot give any assurance that new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations orcourt decisions will not significantly change the requirements relating to our qualification. If wefail to qualify as a REIT, we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders incomputing our taxable income and will again be subject to federal income tax at regular corporaterates, we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax, we could be required to paysignificant income taxes and we would have less money available for our operations anddistributions to shareholders. This would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value ofour securities. We could also be precluded from treatment as a REIT for four taxable yearsfollowing the year in which we lost the qualification, and all distributions to shareholders wouldbe taxable as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings andprofits. Loss of our REIT status would result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived,would prohibit us from drawing funds against the Credit Agreement and could result in theacceleration of all of our indebtedness under our Credit Agreement and Term Loan Agreement whichcould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations,liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.17Table of ContentsWe are dependent on external sources of capital which may not be available on favorable terms, orat all.     We are dependent on external sources of capital to maintain our status as a REIT and mustdistribute to our shareholders each year at least ninety percent of our net taxable income,excluding any net capital gain. Because of these distribution requirements, it is not likely thatwe will be able to fund all future capital needs, including acquisitions, from income fromoperations. Therefore, we will have to continue to rely on third-party sources of capital, whichmay or may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. As part of our overall growth strategywe regularly review opportunities to acquire additional properties and we expect to continue topursue acquisitions that we believe will benefit our financial performance. To the extent that ourcurrent sources of liquidity are not sufficient to fund such acquisitions we will require othersources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Other sourcesof capital may significantly increase our interest rate risk or adversely impact how we manage ourinterest rate risk. We cannot accurately predict how periods of illiquidity in the credit marketswill impact our access to or cost of capital. In addition, additional equity offerings may resultin substantial dilution of shareholders interests, and additional debt financing may substantiallyincrease our leverage. Our access to third-party sources of capital depends upon a number offactors including general market conditions, the markets perception of our growth potential, ourcurrent and potential future earnings and cash distributions, covenants and limitations imposedunder our Credit Agreement and our Term Loan Agreement and the market price of our common stock.     If one or more of the financial institutions that supports our Credit Agreement fails, we maynot be able to find a replacement, which would negatively impact our ability to borrow under ourthe Credit Agreement. We may not be able to refinance our outstanding debt under the CreditAgreement when due in March 2012 or under the Term Loan when due in September 2012, which couldhave a material adverse effect on us.     Our ability to meet the financial and other covenants relating to our Credit Agreement and ourTerm Loan Agreement may be dependent on the performance of our tenants, including Marketing. Shouldour assessments, assumptions and beliefs that affect our accounting prove to be incorrect, or ifcircumstances change, we may have to materially adjust the amounts recorded in our financialstatements for certain assets and liabilities, and, as a result, we may not be in compliance withthe financial covenants in our Credit Agreement and our Term Loan Agreement. We have determinedthat the aggregate amount of the Marketing Environmental Liabilities (as estimated by us, based onour assumptions and analysis of information currently available to us described in more detailabove) would be material to us if we were required to accrue for all of the Marketing EnvironmentalLiabilities since  as a result of such accrual, we would not be in compliance with theexisting financial covenants in our Credit Agreement and our Term Loan Agreement. (For additionalinformation with respect to The Marketing Environmental Liabilities, see Item 7. ManagementsDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  General  Marketingand the Marketing Leases.) If we are not in compliance with one or more of our covenants which ifnot complied with could result in an event of default under our Credit Agreement or our Term LoanAgreement, there can be no assurance that our lenders would waive such non-compliance. An event ofdefault if not cured or waived would increase by 2.0% the interest rate we pay under our CreditAgreement. A default under our Credit Agreement or our Term Loan Agreement, if not cured or waived,would prohibit us from drawing funds against the Credit Agreement and could result in theacceleration of all of our indebtedness under such agreements. We may be unable to fulfill ourcommitments to complete pending acquisitions and incur monetary losses or damage our reputation ifwe cannot draw sufficient funds against the Credit Agreement. This could have a material adverseaffect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to paydividends or stock price.The downturn in the credit markets has increased the cost of borrowing and has made financingdifficult to obtain, which may negatively impact our business, and may have a material adverseeffect on us. Lenders may require us to enter into more restrictive covenants relating to ouroperations.     During 2007, the United States housing and residential lending markets began to experienceaccelerating default rates, declining real estate values and increasing backlog of housing supply.The residential sector issues quickly spread more broadly into the corporate, asset-backed andother credit and equity markets and the volatility and risk premiums in most credit and equitymarkets have increased dramatically, while liquidity has decreased. These issues continuedthroughout 2010 and into the beginning of 2011. Increasing concerns regarding the United States andworld economic outlook, such as large asset write-downs at banks, volatility in oil prices,declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment and bankruptcy filings, arecompounding these issues and risk premiums in most capital markets remain at elevated levels. Thesefactors are precipitating generalized credit market dislocations and a significant contraction inavailable credit. As a result, it is more difficult to obtain cost-effective debt capital tofinance new investment activity or to refinance maturing18Table of Contentsdebt, and most lenders are imposing more stringent restrictions on the terms of credit. Anyfuture credit agreements or loan documents we execute may contain additional or more restrictivecovenants. The negative impact on the tightening of the credit markets and continuing credit andliquidity concerns could have negative effects on our business such as (i) we could have difficultyin acquiring or developing properties, which would adversely affect our business strategy, (ii) ourliquidity could be adversely affected, (iii) we may be unable to repay or refinance ourindebtedness or (iv) we may need to make higher interest and principal payments or sell some of ourassets on unfavorable terms to fund our liquidity needs. These negative effects may cause othermaterial adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations, ability topay dividends or stock price. Additionally, there is no assurance that the increased financingcosts, financing with increasingly restrictive terms or the increase in risk premiums that aredemanded by investors will not have a material adverse effect on us.Our business operations may not generate sufficient cash for distributions or debt service.     There is no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations orthat future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to makedistributions on our common stock, to pay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs.We may not be able to repay or refinance existing indebtedness on favorable terms, which couldforce us to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms (which may also result in losses) oraccept financing on unfavorable terms.We are exposed to interest rate risk and there can be no assurances that we will manage or mitigatethis risk effectively.     We are exposed to interest rate risk, primarily as a result of our $175.0 million CreditAgreement and our $25.0 million Term Loan Agreement. Borrowings under our Credit Agreement and ourTerm Loan Agreement bear interest at a floating rate. Accordingly, an increase in interest rateswill increase the amount of interest we must pay under our Credit Agreement and our Term LoanAgreement. A significant increase in interest rates could also make it more difficult to findalternative financing on desirable terms. We have entered into an interest rate Swap Agreement witha major financial institution which expires in June 2011 with respect to a portion of our variablerate debt outstanding under our Credit Agreement and our Term Loan agreement. We are, and will be,exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that our aggregate borrowings floating at market ratesexceed the $45.0 million notional amount of the Swap Agreement. We will be fully exposed tointerest rate risk on our aggregate borrowings floating at market rates upon expiration of the SwapAgreement in June 2011 unless we enter into another swap agreement. Although the Swap Agreement isintended to lessen the impact of rising interest rates, it also exposes us to the risk that theother party to the agreement will not perform, the agreement will be unenforceable and theunderlying transactions will fail to qualify as a highly-effective cash flow hedge for accountingpurposes. Further, there can be no assurance that the use of an interest rate swap will always beto our benefit. While the use of an interest rate Swap Agreement is intended to lessen the adverseimpact of rising interest rates, it also conversely limits the positive impact that could berealized from falling interest rates with respect to the portion of our variable rate debt coveredby the interest rate Swap Agreement. (For additional information with respect to interest raterisk, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks.)We may be unable to pay dividends.     Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, our ability to pay dividends would be restrictedif, after payment of the dividend, (1) we would not be able to pay indebtedness as it becomes duein the usual course of business or (2) our total assets would be less than the sum of ourliabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if we were to be dissolved, to satisfy the rightsof any shareholders with liquidation preferences. There currently are no shareholders withliquidation preferences. No assurance can be given that our financial performance in the futurewill permit our payment of any dividends at the level historically paid, if at all. (For additionalinformation regarding Marketing and the Marketing Leases, see Item 7. Managements Discussion andAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  General  Marketing and the MarketingLeases.) In particular, our Credit Agreement and our Term Loan Agreement prohibit the payments ofdividends during certain events of default. As a result of the factors described above, we mayexperience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis, whichcould materially and adversely affect our business, stock price and ability to pay dividends.19Table of ContentsWe may change the dividend policy of our common stock in the future.     The decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future, as well as thetiming, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of ourBoard of Directors and will depend on such factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant and thedividend paid may vary from expected amounts. No assurance can be given that our financialperformance in the future will permit our payment of any dividends at the level historically paid,if at all. (For additional information regarding Marketing and the Marketing Leases, see Item 7.Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  General Marketing and the Marketing Leases.) Any change in our dividend policy could adversely affect ourbusiness and the market price of our common stock. A recent Internal Revenue Service (IRS)revenue procedure allows us to satisfy the REIT income distribution requirement by distributing upto 90% of our dividends on our common stock in shares of our common stock in lieu of payingdividends entirely in cash. Although we reserve the right to utilize this procedure in the future,we currently have no intent to do so. In the event that we pay a portion of a dividend in shares ofour common stock, taxable U.S. shareholders would be required to pay tax on the entire amount ofthe dividend, including the portion paid in shares of common stock, in which case such shareholdersmight have to pay the tax using cash from other sources. If a U.S. shareholder sells the stock itreceives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amountincluded in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our common stockat the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to non-U.S. shareholders, we may be required towithhold U.S. tax with respect to such dividend, including in respect of all or a portion of suchdividend that is payable in stock. In addition, if a significant number of our shareholders sellshares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, such sales would put downwardpressure on the market price of our common stock.Changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded commonstock.     As with other publicly traded securities, the market price of our publicly traded common stockdepends on various market conditions, which may change from time-to-time. Among the marketconditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded common stock are the following:  our financial condition and performance and that of our significant tenants,including Marketing (for additional information regarding Marketing and the MarketingLeases, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition andResults of Operations  General  Marketing and the Marketing Leases.);   the markets perception of our growth potential and potential future earnings;   the reputation of REITs generally and the reputation of REITs with portfolios similarto us;   the attractiveness of the securities of REITs in comparison to securities issued byother entities (including securities issued by other real estate companies);   an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demanda higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for publicly traded securities;   the extent of institutional investor interest in us; and   general economic and financial market conditions.In order to preserve our REIT status, our charter limits the number of shares a person may own,which may discourage a takeover that could result in a premium price for our common stock orotherwise benefit our stockholders.     Our charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our directors to take such actions as arenecessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.Unless exempted by our board of directors, no person may actually or constructively own more than5% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding shares of ourcommon stock or the outstanding shares of any class or series of our preferred stock, which mayinhibit large investors from desiring to purchase our stock. This restriction may have the effectof delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control, including an extraordinary transaction(such as a merger, tender offer, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets) that mightprovide a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of ourstockholders.Maryland law may discourage a third party from acquiring us.     We are subject to the provisions of Maryland Business Combination Act (the BusinessCombination Act) which prohibits transactions between a Maryland corporation and an interestedstockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for 5 (five) years after the most recentdate on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested20Table of Contentsstockholder. Generally, pursuant to the Business Combination Act, an interested stockholderis a person who, together with affiliates and associates, beneficially owns, directly orindirectly, 10% or more of a Maryland corporations voting stock. These provisions could have theeffect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of our company or reducing theprice that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our capital stock.Additionally, the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act may deny voting rights to shares involvedin an acquisition of one-tenth or more of the voting stock of a Maryland corporation. In ourcharter and bylaws, we have elected not to have the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act apply toany acquisition by any person of shares of stock of our company. However, in the case of thecontrol share acquisition statute, our board of directors may opt to make this statute applicableto us at any time by amending our bylaws, and may do so on a retroactive basis. Finally, theunsolicited takeovers provisions of the Maryland GeneralCorporation Law permit our board of directors, without stockholderapproval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to implementcertain provisions that may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making an acquisitionproposal for our Company or of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our Companyunder circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common stocks with theopportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price or that stockholders mayotherwise believe is in their best interests.Inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.     Although inflation has not materially impacted our results of operations in the recent past,increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incurin the future and on our results of operations. During times when inflation is greater thanincreases in rent, as provided for in our leases, rent increases may not keep up with the rate ofinflation. Likewise, even though our triple-net leases reduce our exposure to rising propertyexpenses due to inflation, substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have anadverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue,which may adversely affect the tenants ability to pay rent.The loss of certain members of our management team could adversely affect our business.     We depend upon the skills and experience of our executive officers. Loss of the services ofany of them could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results ofoperations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. Except for the employment agreementwith our President and Chief Executive Officer, David Driscoll, we do not have employmentagreements with any of our executives.Amendments to the Accounting Standards Codification made by the Financial Accounting StandardsBoard (the FASB) or changes in accounting standards issued by other standard-setting bodies mayadversely affect our reported revenues, profitability or financial position.     Our financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP in accordance with theAccounting Standards Codification, which is periodically amended by the FASB. The application ofGAAP is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, we are required to adoptamendments to the Accounting Standards Codification or comply with revised interpretations that areissued from time-to-time by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB and the SEC. Thosechanges could adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability or financial position.Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the market on which our common stocktrades, the markets in which we operate, our operations and our results of operations.     Terrorist attacks or other acts of violence or war could affect our business or the businessesof our tenants or of Marketing or its parent. The consequences of armed conflicts areunpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effecton us. More generally, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decreaseor result in increased volatility in the United States and worldwide financial markets and economy.Terrorist attacks also could be a factor resulting in, or a continuation of, an economic recessionin the United States or abroad. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect onour business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends orstock price"
14,GTY,GETTY REALTY CORP,2008-03-17,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
     We are subject to various risks, many of which are beyond our control. As a result of theseand other factors, we may experience material fluctuations in our future operating results on aquarterly or annual basis, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financialcondition, results of operations liquidity, ability to pay dividends and stock price. An investmentin our stock involves various risks, including those mentioned below and elsewhere this AnnualReport on Form 10-K and those that are detailed from time to time in our other filings with theSEC.We are subject to risks inherent in owning and leasing real estate.     We are subject to varying degrees of risk generally related to leasing and owning real estatemany of which are beyond our control. In addition to general risks related to owning propertiesused in the petroleum marketing industry, our risks include, among others: our liability as a lessee for long-term lease obligations regardless of our revenues,  deterioration in national, regional and local economic and real estate marketconditions,  potential changes in supply of, or demand for, rental properties similar to ours,  competition for tenants and changes in rental rates,  difficulty in reletting properties on favorable terms or at all,  impairments in our ability to collect rent payments when due,  increases in interest rates and adverse changes in the availability, cost and terms offinancing,  the potential for uninsured casualty and other losses,  the impact of present or future environmental legislation and compliance withenvironmental laws,  adverse changes in zoning laws and other regulations, and  acts of terrorism and war.     Each of these factors could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends and stock price. In addition,real estate investments are relatively illiquid, which means that our ability to vary our portfolioof properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be limited.Because our revenues are primarily dependent on the performance of Getty Petroleum Marketing Inc.,our primary tenant, in the event that Marketing cannot or will not perform its rental,environmental and other obligations under the Marketing Leases, or if the Marketing Leases aremodified significantly or terminated, or if it becomes probable thatMarketing will not pay itsenvironmental obligations, or if we change our assumptions for rental revenue or environmentalliabilities related to the Marketing Leases, our business, financial condition, revenues, operatingexpenses, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends and stock price could bematerially adversely affected. No assurance can be given that Marketing will have the ability topay its debts or meet its rental, environmental or other obligations under the MarketingLeases.     Marketings earnings and cash flow from operations depend largely upon the sale of refinedpetroleum products at margins in excess of its fixed and variable expenses and rental income fromits subtenants. The petroleum marketing industry has been, and continues to be, volatile and highlycompetitive. A large, rapid increase in wholesale petroleum prices would adversely affectMarketings profitability and cash flow if the increased cost of petroleum products could not bepassed on to Marketings customers or if the consumption of gasoline for automotive use were todecline significantly. Petroleum products are commodities, the prices of which depend on numerousfactors that affect supply and demand. The prices paid by Marketing and other petroleum marketersfor products are affected by global, national and regional factors. We cannot accurately predicthow these factors will affect petroleum product prices or supply in the future, or how inparticular they will affect Marketing or our other tenants.     A substantial portion of our revenues (76% for the three months ended December 31, 2007 and78% for the year ended December 31, 2007) are derived from Marketing Leases with Marketing.Accordingly, our revenues are dependent to a large degree on the economic performance of Marketingand of the petroleum marketing industry, and any factor that adversely affects Marketing, or ourrelationship with Marketing, may have a material adverse effect on us. Through March 2008,Marketing has made all required monthly rental payments under the Marketing Leases when due,although there is no assurance that it will continue to do so. Even8 though Marketing is wholly-owned by a subsidiary of LUKoil, one of the largest integratedRussian oil companies, Lukoil is not a guarantor of the Marketing Leases and there can be noassurance that Lukoil will continue to provide credit enhancement or additional capital toMarketing in the future.     In accordance with GAAP, the aggregate minimum rent due over the current terms of theMarketing Leases, substantially all of which are scheduled to expire in December 2015, isrecognized on a straight-line basis rather than when the cash payment is due. We have recorded asdeferred rent receivable on our consolidated balance sheet the cumulativedifference between lease revenue recognized under this straight line accounting method and thelease revenue recognized when the payment is due under the contractual payment terms. We providereserves for a portion of the recorded deferred rent receivable if circumstances indicate that aproperty may be disposed of before the end of the current lease term or if it is not reasonable toassume that a tenant will make all of its contractual lease payments when due during the currentlease term. Our assessments and assumptions regarding the recoverability of the deferred rentreceivable related to the properties subject to the Marketing Leases are reviewed on a quarterlybasis and such assessments and assumptions are subject to change.     We have had periodic discussions with representatives of Marketing regarding potentialmodifications to the Marketing Leases and in the course of such discussions Marketing has proposedto (i) remove the Subject Properties from the Marketing Leases and eliminate payment of rent to us,and eliminate or reduce payment of operating expenses, with respect to the Subject Properties, and(ii) reduce the aggregate amount of rent payable to us for the Remaining Properties. In light ofthese developments, and Marketings financial performance, which continued to deteriorate in thefourth quarter and for the year ended December 31, 2007 (as discussed below), we intend to attemptto negotiate with Marketing for a modification of the Marketing Leases which removes the SubjectProperties from the Marketing Leases. Following any such modification, we intend either to reletthe Subject Properties or to sell the Subject Properties and reinvest the proceeds in newproperties. Any such modification would likely significantly reduce the amount of rent we receivefrom Marketing and increase our operating expenses. We cannot accurately predict if or when the Marketing Leases willbe modified or what the terms of any agreement may be if the Marketing Leases are modified. Wealso cannot accurately predict what actions Marketing and Lukoil may take, and what our recoursemay be, whether the Marketing Leases are modified or not.     Representatives of Marketing have also indicated to us that they are considering significantchanges to Marketings business model. We intend to attempt to negotiate with Marketing for amodification of the Marketing Leases to remove the Subject Properties; however if Marketingultimately determines that its business strategy is to exit all of the properties it leases from usor to divest a composition of properties different from the properties comprising the SubjectProperties, it is our intention to cooperate with Marketing in accomplishing those objectives tothe extent that is prudent for us to do so by seeking replacement tenants or buyers for theproperties subject to the Marketing Leases, either individually, in groups of properties, or byseeking a single tenant for the entire portfolio of properties subject to the Marketing Leases.Although we are the fee or leasehold owner of the properties subject to the Marketing Leases andthe owner of the Getty® brand and have prior experience with tenants who operate their gasstations, convenience stores, automotive repair services or other businesses at our properties, inthe event that the Subject Properties or other properties are removed from the Marketing Leases, wecannot accurately predict if, when, or on what terms, such properties could be re-let or sold.     In February 2008 we received Marketings unaudited financial statements for the year endedDecember 31, 2007 and became aware that the previously disclosed deterioration in Marketingsfinancial performance had continued to a point where, in conjunction with our intention to attemptto negotiate with Marketing for a modification of the Marketing Leases to remove the SubjectProperties, we can no longer reasonably assume that we will collect all of the rent due to usrelated to the Subject Properties for the remainder of the current lease terms. In reaching thisconclusion, we relied on various indicators, including, but not limited to, the following: (i)Marketings significant operating losses, (ii) its negative cash flow from operating activities,(iii) its asset impairment charges for underperforming assets, and (iv) its negative earningsbefore interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent payable to the Company. Based upon ourassessments and assumptions, we believe that it is probable at this time that Lukoil would notallow Marketing to fail to perform its obligations under the Marketing Leases. Should ourassessments and assumptions prove to be incorrect, the conclusions reached by the Company relatingto (i) recoverability of the deferred rent receivable for the Remaining Properties and (ii)Marketings ability to pay its environmental liabilities (as discussed below) would likely change.     Based upon our belief that Marketing desires to have the Subject Properties removed from theMarketing Leases, and our intention to attempt to negotiate a modification of the Marketing Leasesto such end, we believe that Marketing will not make all contractual lease payments when due forthe entire current term of the Marketing Leases with respect to the Subject Properties.Accordingly, we have reserved approximately $10.5 million of the deferred rent receivable recordedas of December 31, 2007, which is the full amount9 of the deferred rent receivable related to the Subject Properties. This non-cash reserve hasbeen reflected in our results of operations for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2007based on information that became available to us from Marketing after we announced our results ofoperations for those periods. Providing this $10.5 million reserve reduces our net earnings andour funds from operations but does not impact our cash flow from operating activities or adjustedfunds from operations since the impact of the straight-line method of accounting is not included inour determination of adjusted funds from operations. For additional information regarding fundsfrom operations and adjusted funds from operations, which are non-GAAP measures, see General Supplemental Non-GAAP Measures in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition andResults of Operations and Selected Financial Data both of which appear in our Annual Report toShareholders filed as exhibit 13 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are incorporated byreference herein. While we believe it is no longer reasonable to assume that Marketing will makeall contractual lease payments when due for the entire current term of the Marketing Leases withrespect to the Subject Properties, after considering Marketings financial condition, our intentionto negotiate a modification of the Marketing Leases, and certain other factors, including but notlimited to those described above, we continue to believe that it is probable that we will collectthe deferred rent receivable recorded as of December 31, 2007 related to the Remaining Properties.In addition, based upon our evaluation of the carrying value of the Subject Properties, we believethat no impairment adjustment is necessary for the Subject Properties as of December 31, 2007pursuant to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144. We intend toregularly review our assumptions that affect the accounting for rental revenue related to theRemaining Properties subject to the Marketing Leases and our assumptions regarding potentialimpairment of the Subject Properties and, if appropriate, to consider adjusting our reserves.Beginning in the first quarter of 2008, we anticipate that the rental revenue for the RemainingProperties will continue to be recognized on a straight-line basis and the rental revenue for theSubject Properties will be recognized when paid under the contractual payment terms.     As the operator of our properties under the Marketing Leases, Marketing is directlyresponsible to pay for the remediation of environmental contamination it causes and to comply withvarious environmental laws and regulations. In addition, the Marketing Leases and various otheragreements between Marketing and us allocate responsibility for known and unknown environmentalliabilities between Marketing and us relating to the properties subject to the Marketing Leases.Based on various factors, including our assessments and assumptions at this time that Lukoil wouldnot allow Marketing to fail to perform its obligations under the Marketing Leases, we believe thatMarketing will continue to pay for substantially all environmental contamination and remediationcosts allocated to it under the Marketing Leases. It is possible that our assumptions regardingthe ultimate allocation methods and share of responsibility that we used to allocate environmentalliabilities may change as a result of the factors discussed above, or otherwise, which may resultin adjustments to the amounts recorded for environmental litigation accruals, environmentalremediation liabilities and related assets. We may ultimately be responsible to directly pay forenvironmental liabilities as the property owner if Marketing fails to pay them. We are required toaccrue for environmental liabilities that we believe are allocable to Marketing under the MarketingLeases and various other agreements if we determine that it is probable that Marketing will not payits environmental obligations.     Based upon our assessment of Marketings financial condition and certain other factors,including but not limited to those described above, we believe at this time that it is not probablethat Marketing will not pay the environmental liabilities allocable to it under the MarketingLeases and various other agreements and, therefore, have not accrued for such environmentalliabilities. Our assessments and assumptions that affect the recording of environmental liabilitiesrelated to the properties subject to the Marketing Leases are reviewed on a quarterly basis andsuch assessments and assumptions are subject to change.     We cannot provide any assurance that Marketing will continue to pay its debts or meet itsrental, environmental or other obligations under the Marketing Leases prior or subsequent to anypotential modification to the Marketing Leases discussed above. Additionally, we may be required to(i) reserve additional amounts of the deferred rent receivable at a later time, (ii) accrue forenvironmental liabilities that we believe are allocable to Marketing under the Marketing Leases andvarious other agreements, or (iii) record an impairment charge related to the Subject Properties asa result of the proposed modification of the Marketing Leases. In the event that Marketing cannotor will not perform its rental, environmental or other obligations under the Marketing Leases; ifthe Marketing Leases are modified significantly or terminated; if we determine that it is probablethat Marketing will not meet its environmental obligations and we accrue for such liabilities; ifwe are unable to relet or sell the properties subject to the Marketing Leases; or if we change ourassumptions that affect the accounting for rental revenue or environmental liabilities related tothe Marketing Leases; our business, financial condition, revenues, operating expenses, results ofoperations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends and stock price may be materially adverselyaffected.     For additional information regarding factors that could adversely affect us relating toMarketing, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors
 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.10 In 2004, we received a comment letter from the SEC that contains one comment that remainsunresolved.     One comment remains unresolved as part of a periodic review commenced in 2004 by the Divisionof Corporation Finance of the SEC of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,2003 pertaining to the SECs position that we must include the financial statements and summarizedfinancial data of Marketing in our periodic filings, which Marketing contends is prohibited by theterms of the Master Lease. In June 2005, the SEC indicated that, unless we file Marketingsfinancial statements and summarized financial data with our periodic reports: (i) it will notconsider our Annual Reports on Forms 10-K for the years beginning with fiscal 2000 to be compliant;(ii) it will not consider us to be current in our reporting requirements; (iii) it will not be in aposition to declare effective any registration statements we may file for public offerings of oursecurities; and (iv) we should consider how the SECs conclusion impacts our ability to make offersand sales of our securities under existing registration statements and if we have a liability forsuch offers and sales made pursuant to registration statements that did not contain the financialstatements of Marketing. We have had no communication with the SEC since 2005. We cannotaccurately predict the consequences if we are ultimately unable to resolve this outstandingcomment.Substantially all of our tenants depend on the same industry for their revenues.     We derive substantially all of our revenues from leasing, primarily on a triple-net basis,retail motor fuel and convenience store properties and petroleum distribution terminals to tenantsin the petroleum marketing industry. Accordingly, our revenues will be dependent on the economicsuccess of the petroleum marketing industry, and any factors that adversely affect that industrycould also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results ofoperations liquidity, ability to pay dividends and stock price. The success of participants in thatindustry depends upon the sale of refined petroleum products at margins in excess of fixed andvariable expenses. A large, rapid increase in wholesale petroleum prices would adversely affect theprofitability and cash flows of Marketing and our other tenants if the increased cost of petroleumproducts could not be passed on to their customers or if automobile consumption of gasoline were todecline significantly. Petroleum products are commodities, the prices of which depend on numerousfactors that affect the supply of and demand for petroleum products. The prices paid by Marketingand other petroleum marketers for products are affected by global, national and regional factors.We cannot be certain how these factors will affect petroleum product prices or supply in thefuture, or how in particular they will affect Marketing or our other tenants.Property taxes on our properties may increase without notice.     Each of the properties we own or lease is subject to real property taxes. The leases forcertain of the properties that we lease from third parties obligate us to pay real property taxeswith regard to those properties. The real property taxes on our properties and any other propertiesthat we develop, acquire or lease in the future may increase as property tax rates change and asthose properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities. To the extent that our tenants areunable or unwilling to pay such increase in accordance with their leases, our net operatingexpenses may increase.We have incurred, and may continue to incur, operating costs as a result of environmental laws andregulation, which could reduce our profitability.     The real estate business and the petroleum products industry are subject to numerous federal,state and local laws and regulations, including matters relating to the protection of theenvironment. Under certain environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of realestate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous ortoxic substances or petroleum products at, on, or under, such property, and may be required toinvestigate and clean-up such contamination. Such laws typically impose liability and clean-upresponsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence ofthe contaminants, or the timing or cause of the contamination, and the liability under such lawshas been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonablebasis for allocation of responsibility. For example, liability may arise as a result of thehistorical use of a property or from the migration of contamination from adjacent or nearbyproperties. Any such contamination or liability may also reduce the value of the property. Inaddition, the owner or operator of a property may be subject to claims by third parties based oninjury, damage and/or costs, including investigation and clean-up costs, resulting fromenvironmental contamination present at or emanating from a property. (See Item 3. LegalProceedings.) The properties owned or controlled by us are leased primarily as retail motor fueland convenience store properties, and therefore may contain, or may have contained, USTs for thestorage of petroleum products and other hazardous or toxic substances, which creates a potentialfor the release of such products or substances. Some of our properties may be subject toregulations regarding the retirement and decommissioning or removal of long-lived assets includingbuildings containing hazardous materials, USTs and other equipment. Some of the properties may beadjacent to or near properties that have contained or currently contain USTs used to storepetroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, certain of the propertiesare on, adjacent to, or near properties upon which others have engaged or may in the future engagein activities that may release petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. There maybe other11 environmental problems associated with our properties of which we are unaware. These problemsmay make it more difficult for us to relet or sell our properties on favorable terms, or at all.     We have agreed to provide limited environmental indemnification to Marketing, capped at $4.25million and expiring in 2010, for certain pre-existing conditions at six of the terminals we ownand lease to Marketing. Under the agreement, Marketing is obligated to pay the first $1.5 millionof costs and expenses incurred in connection with remediating any such pre-existing conditions,Marketing will share equally with us the next $8.5 million of those costs and expenses andMarketing is obligated to pay all additional costs and expenses over $10.0 million. We had accrued$0.3 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 in connection with this indemnification agreement.See recent developments related to Marketing and the Marketing Leases in Part 1. Item 1. Business Recent Developments in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.     We have not accrued for approximately $1.0 million in costs allegedly incurred by the currentproperty owner in connection with removal of USTs and soil remediation at a property that wasleased to and operated by Marketing. We believe Marketing is responsible for such costs under the terms ofthe Master Lease, but Marketing had denied its liability for claims and its responsibility todefend against, and indemnify us, for the claim. In addition, Marketing has denied liability andrefused our tender for defense and indemnification for another legal proceeding. We have filedthird party claims against Marketing in both proceedings. It is reasonably possible that ourassumption that Marketing will be ultimately responsible for the claim may change, which may resultin our providing an accrual for this matter.     As of December 31, 2007, we had accrued $14.3 million as managements best estimate of the netfair value of reasonably estimable environmental remediation costs which is comprised of $19.0million of estimated environmental obligations and liabilities offset by $4.7 million of estimatedrecoveries from state UST remediation funds, net of allowance. Environmental expenditures were $6.3million and recoveries from UST funds were $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.     As the operator of our properties under the Marketing Leases, Marketing is directlyresponsible to pay for the remediation of environmental contamination it causes and to comply withvarious environmental laws and regulations. In addition, the Marketing Leases and various otheragreements between Marketing and us allocate responsibility for known and unknown environmentalliabilities between Marketing and us relating to the properties subject to the Marketing Leases.Based on various factors, including our assessments and assumptions at this time that Lukoil wouldnot allow Marketing to fail to perform its obligations under the Marketing Leases, we believe thatMarketing will continue to pay for substantially all environmental contamination and remediationcosts allocated to it under the Marketing Leases. It is possible that our assumptions regardingthe ultimate allocation methods and share of responsibility that we used to allocate environmentalliabilities may change as a result of the factors discussed under Item 1, Business  RecentDevelopments, or otherwise, which may result in adjustments to the amounts recorded forenvironmental litigation accruals, environmental remediation liabilities and related assets. Wemay ultimately be responsible to directly pay for environmental liabilities as the property ownerif Marketing fails to pay them.     Based upon our assessment of Marketings financial condition and certain other factors,including but not limited to those described above, we believe at this time that it is not probablethat Marketing will not pay the environmental liabilities allocable to it under the MarketingLeases and various other agreements and, therefore, have not accrued for such environmentalliabilities. Our assessments and assumptions that affect the recording of environmental liabilitiesrelated to the properties subject to the Marketing Leases are reviewed on a quarterly basis andsuch assessments and assumptions are subject to change. If our assessments and assumptionsregarding such matters change and we are required to accrue for environmental liabilities allocatedto Marketing under the Marketing Leases and various other agreements between Marketing and us or ifwe ultimately are responsible to directly pay for such environmental liabilities as the propertyowner if Marketing fails to pay them, our business, financial condition, revenues, operatingexpenses, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends and stock price may bematerially adversely affected.     We cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations may be enacted in the future,or if or how existing laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted with respect toproducts or activities to which they have not previously been applied. We cannot predict whetherstate UST fund programs will be administered and funded in the future in a manner that isconsistent with past practices or whether future environmental spending will continue to beeligible for reimbursement under these programs. Compliance with more stringent laws orregulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of the regulatory agencies or stricterinterpretation of existing laws which may develop in the future, could have an adverse effect onus, or our tenants, and could require substantial additional expenditures for future remediation.     For additional information with respect to environmental remediation costs and estimates seeEnvironmental Matters in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Resultsof Operations and Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated12 Financial Statements, both of which appear in our Annual Report to Shareholders filed asexhibit 13 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are incorporated by reference herein.     As a result of the factors discussed above, or others, compliance with environmental laws andregulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results ofoperations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends and stock price.We are defending pending lawsuits and claims and are subject to material losses.     We are subject to various lawsuits and claims, including litigation related to environmentalmatters, damages resulting from leaking USTs and toxic tort claims. The ultimate resolution ofcertain matters cannot be predicted because considerable uncertainty exists both in terms of theprobability of loss and the estimate of such loss. Our ultimate liabilities resulting from suchlawsuits and claims, if any, could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends and stock price.A significant portion of our properties are concentrated in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regionsof the United States, and adverse conditions in those regions, in particular, could negativelyimpact our operations.     A significant portion of the properties we own and lease are located in the Northeast andMid-Atlantic regions of the United States. Because of the concentration of our properties in thoseregions, in the event of adverse economic conditions in those regions, we would likely experiencehigher risk of default on payment of rent payable to us (including under the Marketing Leases) thanif our properties were more geographically diversified. Additionally, the rents on our propertiesmay be subject to a greater risk of default than other properties in the event of adverse economic,political, or business developments or natural hazards that may affect the Northeast orMid-Atlantic United States and the ability of our lessees to make rent payments. This lack ofgeographical diversification could have a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends and stock price.We are in a competitive business.     The real estate industry is highly competitive. Where we own properties, we compete fortenants with a large number of real estate property owners and other companies that subletproperties. Our principal means of competition are rents charged in relation to the incomeproducing potential of the location. In addition, we expect other major real estate investors, somewith much greater resources than us, will compete with us for attractive acquisition opportunities.These competitors include petroleum manufacturing, distributing and marketing companies, otherREITs, investment banking firms and private institutional investors. This competition has increasedprices for commercial properties and may impair our ability to make suitable property acquisitionson favorable terms in the future.Our future cash flow is dependent on renewal of leases and either reletting or selling ourproperties.     We are subject to risks that financial distress of our tenants may lead to vacancies at ourproperties, that leases may not be renewed, that locations may not be relet or that the terms ofrenewal or reletting (including the cost of required renovations) may be less favorable thancurrent lease terms. As described in the recent developments section above in Item 1. Business -Recent Developments, we intend to attempt to negotiate a modification of the Marketing Leases with Marketingto remove the Subject Properties from the Marketing Leases. Any such modification is likely tosignificantly reduce the amount of rent we receive from Marketing and increase our operatingexpenses. We cannot accurately predict if, or when, the Marketing Leases will be modified or whatthe terms of any modification may be if the Marketing Leases are modified. We also cannotaccurately predict what actions Marketing and Lukoil may take, and what our recourse may be,whether the Marketing Leases are modified or not. In addition, numerous properties compete withour properties in attracting tenants to lease space. The number of competitive properties in aparticular area could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease our properties ornewly acquired properties and on the rents charged. If we were unable to promptly relet or renewthe leases for all or a substantial portion of these locations, or if the rental rates upon suchrenewal or reletting were significantly lower than expected, our cash flow could be adverselyaffected and the resale values or our properties could decline.We may acquire or develop new properties, and this may create risks.     We may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate companies when we believethat an acquisition or development matches our business strategies. We may not succeed inconsummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within our budget. Wealso may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to covertheir costs of acquisition or development and operations.13 We are subject to losses that may not be covered by insurance.     Marketing, and other tenants, as the lessees of our properties, are required to provideinsurance for such properties, including casualty, liability, fire and extended coverage in amountsand on other terms as set forth in our leases. We carry insurance against certain risks and in suchamounts as we believe are customary for businesses of our kind. However, as the costs andavailability of insurance change, we may decide not to be covered against certain losses (such ascertain environmental liabilities, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and civil disorder) where, inthe judgment of management, the insurance is not warranted due to cost or availability of coverageor the remoteness of perceived risk. There is no assurance that our insurance against loss will besufficient. The destruction of, or significant damage to, or significant liabilities arising out ofconditions at, our properties due to an uninsured cause would result in an economic loss and couldresult in us losing both our investment in, and anticipated profits from, such properties. When aloss is insured, the coverage may be insufficient in amount or duration, or a lessees customersmay be lost, such that the lessee cannot resume its business after the loss at prior levels or atall, resulting in reduced rent or a default under its lease. Any such loss relating to a largenumber of properties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends and stock price.Failure to qualify as a REIT under the federal income tax laws would have adverse consequences toour shareholders.     We elected to be treated as a REIT under the federal income tax laws beginning January 1,2001. We cannot, however, guarantee that we will continue to qualify in the future as a REIT. Wecannot give any assurance that new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations orcourt decisions will not significantly change the requirements relating to our qualification. If wefail to qualify as a REIT, we will again be subject to federal income tax at regular corporaterates, we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax, we would be required to paysignificant income taxes and would have less money available for our operations and distributionsto shareholders. This would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of oursecurities. We could also be precluded from treatment as a REIT for four taxable years followingthe year in which we lost the qualification, and all distributions to stockholders would be taxableas regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits.Loss of our REIT status would result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, couldresult in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness under our Credit Agreement which could have amaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity,ability to pay dividends and stock price.As a REIT, we are dependent on external sources of capital which may not be available on favorableterms, if at all.     To maintain our status as a REIT, we must distribute to our shareholders each year at leastninety percent of our net taxable income, excluding any net capital gain. Because of thesedistribution requirements, it is not likely that we will be able to fund all future capital needs,including acquisitions, from income from operations. Therefore, we will have to continue to rely onthird-party sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. Wecannot accurately predict how periods of illiquidity in the credit markets, such as current marketconditions, will impact our access to or cost of capital. We may be unable to pursue equityofferings until we resolve with the SEC the outstanding comment regarding disclosure of Marketingsfinancial information. Moreover, additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution ofshareholders interests, and additional debt financing may substantially increase our leverage. Ouraccess to third-party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors including general marketconditions, the markets perception of our growth potential, our current and potential futureearnings and cash distributions, limitations on future indebtedness imposed under our CreditAgreement and the market price of our common stock.     Our ability to meet the financial and other covenants relating to our Credit Agreement may bedependent on the performance of our tenants. (See recent developments related to Marketing and theMarketing Leases in Part I, Item 1. Business  Recent Developments in this Annual Report on Form10-K for additional information.) If we are not in compliance with one or more of our covenantswhich, if not complied with could result in an event of default under our Credit Agreement, therecan be no assurance that our lenders would waive such non-compliance. A default under our CreditAgreement, if not cured or waived, whether due to a loss of our REIT status, a material adverseeffect on our business, financial condition or prospects, a failure to comply with financial andcertain other covenants in the Credit Agreement or otherwise, could result in the acceleration ofall of our indebtedness under our Credit Agreement. This could have a material adverse affect onour business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends andstock price.The recent downturn in the credit markets has increased the cost of borrowing and has madefinancing difficult to obtain, which may negatively impact our business, and may have a materialadverse effect on us.14      During 2007, the United States housing and residential lending markets began to experienceaccelerating default rates, declining real estate values and increasing backlog of housing supply.The residential sector issues quickly spread more broadly into the corporate, asset-backed andother credit and equity markets and the volatility and risk premiums in most credit and equitymarkets have increased dramatically, while liquidity has decreased. These issues have continuedinto the beginning of fiscal 2008. Increasing concerns regarding the United States and worldeconomic outlook, such as large asset write-downs at banks, rising oil prices, declining businessand consumer confidence and increased unemployment, are compounding these issues and risk premiumsin most capital markets remain near historical all-time highs. These factors are precipitatinggeneralized credit market dislocations and a significant contraction in available credit. As aresult, it is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain cost-effective debt capital to finance newinvestment activity or to refinance maturing debt and most lenders are imposing more stringentrestrictions on the terms of credit. The negative impact on the tightening of the credit marketsand continuing credit and liquidity concerns may have a material adverse effect on our business,financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends and stock price.Additionally, there is no assurance that the increased financing costs, financing with increasinglyrestrictive terms or the increase in risk premiums that are demanded by investors will not have amaterial adverse effect on us.Lenders may require us to enter into more restrictive covenants relating to our operations.     Any future credit agreements or loan documents we execute may contain additional or morerestrictive covenants that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends and stock price.The loss of certain members of our management team could adversely affect our business.     We depend upon the skills and experience of our executive officers. Loss of the services ofany of them could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results ofoperations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends and stock price. We do not have employmentagreements with any of our executives.Our business operations may not generate sufficient cash for distributions or debt service.     There is no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations orthat future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to makedistributions on our common stock, to pay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs.We may not be able to repay or refinance existing indebtedness on favorable terms, which couldforce us to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms (which may also result in losses) oraccept financing on unfavorable terms.     Borrowings under our Credit Agreement bear interest at a floating rate. Accordingly, anincrease in interest rates will increase the amount of interest we must pay under our CreditAgreement and a significant increase in interest rates could also make it more difficult to findalternative financing on desirable terms. We have entered into an interest rate swap agreement witha major financial institution with respect to a portion of our variable rate debt outstanding underour Credit Agreement. Although the agreement is intended to lessen the impact of rising interestrates, it also exposes us to the risk that the other party to the agreement will not perform, theagreement will be unenforceable and the underlying transactions will fail to qualify as ahighly-effective cash flow hedge for accounting purposes.Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financialposition and results of operations, and they require management to make estimates, judgments andassumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain.     Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financialposition and results of operations. We have identified several accounting policies as beingcritical to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations because theyrequire management to make particularly subjective or complex judgments about matters that areinherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would berecorded under different conditions or using different assumptions. Because of the inherentuncertainty of the estimates, judgments and assumptions associated with these critical accountingpolicies, we cannot provide any assurance that we will not make subsequent significant adjustmentsto our consolidated financial statements including those included in this Form 10-K. Estimates,judgments and assumptions underlying our consolidated financial statements include, but are notlimited to, deferred rent receivable, recoveries from state UST funds, environmental remediationcosts, real estate, depreciation and amortization, impairment of long-lived assets, litigation,accrued expenses, income taxes payable and the allocation of the purchase price of propertiesacquired to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For example, we have made judgmentsregarding the level of environmental reserves and reserves for our deferred rent receivablerelating to Marketing and the Marketing Leases. These judgments and assumptions may prove to beincorrect and our business, financial15 condition, revenues, operating expense, results of operations, liquidity, ability to paydividends and stock price may be materially adversely affected if that is the case. See Item 1.BusinessRecent Developments for information regarding Marketing and the Marketing Leases andItem 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results ofOperationsCritical Accounting Policies for more information on our critical accounting policies.Changes in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) orother standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability orfinancial position.     Our financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which are periodicallyrevised and/or expanded. The application of GAAP is also subject to varying interpretations overtime. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or comply withrevised interpretations that are issued from time-to-time by recognized authoritative bodies,including the FASB and the SEC. Those changes could adversely affect our reported revenues,profitability or financial position.We may be unable to pay dividends and our equity may not appreciate.     Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, our ability to pay dividends would be restrictedif, after payment of the dividend, (1) we would not be able to pay indebtedness as it becomes duein the usual course of business or (2) our total assets would be less than the sum of ourliabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if we were to be dissolved, to satisfy the rightsof any shareholders with liquidation preferences. There currently are no shareholders withliquidation preferences. No assurance can be given that our financial performance in the futurewill permit our payment of any dividends. (See recent developments related to Marketing and theMarketing Leases in Part I, Item 1. Business  Recent Developments in this Annual Report on Form10-K.) In particular, our Credit Agreement prohibits the payments of dividends during certainevents of default. As a result of the factors described above, we may experience materialfluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis, which could materially andadversely affect our business, stock price and ability to pay dividends.Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the market on which our common stocktrades, the markets in which we operate, our operations and our results of operations.     Terrorist attacks or armed conflicts could affect our business or the businesses of ourtenants or of Marketing or its parent. The consequences of armed conflicts are unpredictable, andwe may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. Moregenerally, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or resultin increased volatility in the United States and worldwide financial markets and economy. Terroristattacks also could be a factor resulting in, or a continuation of, an economic recession in theUnited States or abroad. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends and stockprice"
