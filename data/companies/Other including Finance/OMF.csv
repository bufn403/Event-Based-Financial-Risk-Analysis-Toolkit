4,OMF,ONEMAIN HOLDINGS INC,2024-02-13,"Risk Factors
.We face a variety of risks that are inherent in our business. In addition to the factors discussed in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC that could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, and results of operations, new risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our business or financial performance. Therefore, the risk factors below should not be considered a complete list of potential risks that we may face.Any risk factor described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any of our other SEC filings could by itself, or together with other factors, materially adversely affect our liquidity, competitive position, business, reputation, results of operations, or financial condition, including by materially increasing our expenses or decreasing our revenues, which could result in material losses.RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSOur financial condition and results of operations and our borrowers’ ability to make payments on their loans have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by economic conditions and other factors that we cannot control.Uncertainty and deterioration in general economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad historically have created a difficult operating environment for consumer lending. Many factors, including factors that are beyond our control, may impact our financial condition or results of operations and/or affect our borrowers’ willingness or capacity to make payments on their loans. These factors include: unemployment levels, housing markets, energy costs, inflation, and interest rates; events such as natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, or catastrophes; events that affect our borrowers, such as major medical expenses, divorce, or death; and the quality of any collateral underlying our finance receivables. If we experience a future economic downturn, or if we become affected by other events beyond our control, we may experience increased credit risks, significant reductions in revenues, earnings and cash flows, difficulties accessing capital, and a deterioration in the value of our investments.Moreover, our customers are primarily nonprime borrowers, who have historically been more likely to be affected, or more severely affected, by adverse macroeconomic conditions than prime borrowers. If a borrower defaults on a finance receivable held directly by us, we will bear a risk of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral, if any, and the outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest on the finance receivable, which could adversely affect our cash flows from operations. The cost to service our loans may also increase without a corresponding increase in our finance charge income.We also are exposed to geographic customer concentration risk. An economic downturn or catastrophic event that disproportionately affects certain geographic regions could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including the performance of our finance receivables portfolio. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 in this report for quantification of our largest concentrations of net finance receivables.We cannot give assurance that our policies and procedures for underwriting, processing, and servicing personal loans or credit cards will adequately adapt to adverse economic or other changes. If we fail to adapt to changing economic conditions or other factors, or if such changes adversely affect our borrowers’ willingness or capacity to repay their loans, our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity would be materially adversely affected.If our estimates of allowance for finance receivable losses are not adequate to absorb actual losses, our provision for finance receivable losses would increase, which could adversely affect our results of operations.We maintain an allowance for finance receivable losses, which is a critical accounting estimate and requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions to determine the appropriate level of allowance. To estimate the appropriate level of allowance for finance receivable losses, we consider known and relevant internal and external factors that affect finance receivable collectability, including the total amount of finance receivables outstanding, historical finance receivable delinquency and charge-offs, our current collection patterns, and current and forecasted economic trends. Our methodology for establishing our allowance for finance receivable losses is based on the guidance from Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, which requires us to measure expected credit losses for financial assets at each reporting date. The allowance is primarily based on historical experience, current conditions, and our reasonable and 20Table of Contents supportable forecast of economic conditions. If customer behavior changes as a result of economic conditions and if we are unable to accurately predict how the unemployment rates, and general economic conditions may affect our allowance for finance receivable losses, our allowance for finance receivable losses may be inadequate. Our allowance for finance receivable losses is an estimate, and if actual finance receivable losses are materially greater than our allowance for finance receivable losses, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Neither state regulators nor federal regulators oversee our allowance for finance receivable losses.Our valuations may include methodologies, models, estimations, and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to financial assets and liabilities that may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We use estimates, assumptions, and judgments when certain financial assets and liabilities are measured and reported at fair value. Fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on quoted market prices and/or other observable inputs provided by independent third-party sources, when available. During periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain assets if trading becomes less frequent or market data becomes less observable. In such cases, certain asset valuations may require significant judgment, and may include inputs and assumptions that require greater estimation, including credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and other relevant inputs. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.Our risk management efforts may not be effective.We could incur substantial losses and our business operations could be disrupted if we are unable to effectively identify, manage, monitor, and mitigate financial risks, such as credit risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk, liquidity risk, and other market-related risks, as well as operational risks related to our business, assets, and liabilities. To the extent our models used to assess the creditworthiness of potential borrowers do not adequately identify potential risks, the valuations produced will not adequately represent the risk profile of the borrowers and could result in a riskier finance receivables profile than originally identified. Our risk management policies, procedures, and techniques, including our scoring technology, may not be sufficient to identify all the risks we are exposed to, mitigate the risks we have identified, or identify concentrations of risk or additional risks to which we may become subject in the future. We also face risks due to our remote workforce and digital operations. These risks may not be adequately captured by our existing risk management framework.Changes in market conditions could adversely affect the rate at which our borrowers prepay their loans and the value of our finance receivables portfolio, as well as increase our financing cost, which could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.Changing market conditions, the availability of credit, the relative economic vitality of the area in which borrowers and their assets are located, changes in tax laws, other opportunities for investment available to our customers, homeowner mobility, and other economic, social, geographic, demographic, and legal factors beyond our control, may affect the rates at which our borrowers prepay their loans. Generally, in situations where prepayment rates have slowed, the weighted-average life of our finance receivables has increased. Any increase in interest rates may further slow the rate of prepayment for our finance receivables, which could adversely affect our liquidity by reducing the cash flows from, and the value of, the finance receivables we hold for sale or utilize as collateral in our secured funding transactions.Moreover, our finance receivables are fixed-rate and generally decline in value if interest rates increase. As such, if changing market conditions cause interest rates to increase substantially, the value of our finance receivables could decline. Some jurisdictions limit the maximum interest rate that we may charge on a certain population of our loans so we have limited ability to increase the interest rate on our loans made in those jurisdictions. Our yield, as well as our cash flows from operations and results of operations, could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to increase the interest rates charged on new loans to offset any increases in our cost of funds. Accordingly, any increase in interest rates could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.Changes in market conditions may also impact market interest rates which could increase the amount of interest expense that we pay on our borrowings, and in turn increase our cost of funds and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.21Table of Contents We may be required to indemnify or repurchase finance receivables from purchasers of finance receivables that we have sold or securitized, or which we will sell or securitize in the future, if our finance receivables fail to meet certain criteria or characteristics or under other circumstances, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.The documents governing our finance receivable sales and securitizations contain provisions that require us to indemnify the purchasers of securitized finance receivables, or to repurchase the affected finance receivables, under certain circumstances. While our sale and securitization documents vary, they generally contain customary provisions that may require us to repurchase finance receivables if there is a breach of representations and warranties concerning the quality and characteristics of the finance receivables and such breach is material and adverse to the purchasers.Our maximum exposure to repurchases or our indemnification obligations under our representations and warranties could include the current unpaid balance of all finance receivables that we have sold or securitized, and which are not subject to settlement agreements with purchasers.The risk of loss on the finance receivables that we have securitized is recognized in our allowance for finance receivable losses since all of our loan securitizations are recorded on our balance sheet. If we are required to indemnify purchasers or repurchase finance receivables that we sell or have sold and such indemnification or repurchase results in losses or recognition of losses on securitized finance receivables that exceed our recorded allowance for finance receivable losses associated with our securitizations, this could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.Our business and reputation may be materially impacted by information system failures, cyber-attacks, or network disruptions.Our business relies heavily on information systems to deliver products and services to our customers and to manage our operations. These systems have encountered, and may in the future encounter, service disruptions due to system, network or software vulnerabilities or failures, security breaches, cyber-attacks, social engineering, ransomware, viruses, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events, disruptions, or intrusions. In addition, denial-of-service attacks could overwhelm our internet sites, applications, and services and prevent us from adequately serving customers and maintaining our operations. Cyber-attacks, including ransomware, are constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of detecting, responding to, and successfully defending against them. We also may face heightened risk due to our remote workforce, use of third-party services, and digital operations. Our security measures vary in maturity across the business, and some of our peers may have more mature cybersecurity programs, which could impact our ability to market and sell our products and services. We may fail or be unable to timely detect and patch certain vulnerabilities, including those classified as zero-day vulnerabilities, which may allow unauthorized actors to gain access to and persist in our system environment over long periods of time. Our logs and other forensic evidence also may not provide a complete picture of a cyber-attack. Cyber-attacks can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our systems and networks and those of our third-party vendors. System redundancy and other continuity measures may not be effective or adequate, and our business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient to adequately address the disruption. These kinds of cyber-attacks and the challenges described herein, or a series of smaller attacks in the aggregate, could impair our ability to offer and process our loans, provide customer service, perform collections or other necessary business activities, and maintain our operations, which could result in a loss of customer business, negative impact to our brand and reputation, subject us to regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. There may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personally identifiable information (PII), that could subject us to significant reputational, financial, legal, and operational consequences.Our operations rely heavily on the secure collection, processing, storage, and transmission of tens of millions of records with confidential customer and other information including, among other things, PII, in our systems and networks, as well as those of third parties. Our branch locations and central servicing centers, as well as our administrative and executive offices, are part of an electronic information network that is designed to permit us to originate and track finance receivables and collections and perform other tasks that are part of our everyday operations. Additionally, due to our remote workforce and digital operations, including our use of third parties and third-party services, our vulnerability to unauthorized access to confidential information may increase. Network and data security measures, such as encryption, access controls, authentication mechanisms, and other security measures intended to protect our systems and data may not be sufficient and data may be vulnerable to hacking, unauthorized 22Table of Contents access, employee error (including phishing and social engineering), malfeasance, system error, faulty password management, or other weaknesses that could be exploited. Any failure, interruption, breakdown, noncompliance, or breach in our cybersecurity measures or controls, policies, or procedures could result in reputational harm, disruption of our customer relationships, litigation or regulatory enforcement, or in our inability to originate, process, and service our finance receivable products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Further, if any of these cybersecurity and operational risks materialize, they could expose us to lawsuits by customers for identity theft or other damages (for example, in the case of a data breach involving PII or misuse of PII), and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. In addition, regulators may impose penalties and/or require remedial action if they identify areas of noncompliance or weaknesses in our security systems, controls, processes, procedures, and policies, and we may be required to incur significant costs to enhance our cybersecurity program, including to address any vulnerabilities that may be discovered or to remediate the harm caused by any security breaches. In addition, we may share confidential customer information and proprietary information with customers, vendors, service providers, and business partners. The information systems of these third parties may be vulnerable to security breaches and, despite our best efforts, we may not be able to ensure that these third parties have appropriate security controls in place to protect information we share with them. If our confidential information is intercepted, accessed without authorization, destroyed, stolen, misused, or mishandled while in possession of a third-party, it could result in reputational harm to us, loss of customer business, regulatory scrutiny, civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Insurance may not be adequate or available to cover losses from such events.We are also subject to the theft or misuse of physical customer and employee records at our facilities.Our branch locations and central servicing centers have physical customer records necessary for day-to-day operations that contain confidential information about our customers. We also retain physical records in various storage locations. The loss or theft of customer information from our branch locations, central servicing facilities, or other storage locations could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and penalties and could expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. In addition, if we cannot locate original documents (or copies, in some cases) for certain finance receivables, we may not be able to collect on those finance receivables.Our insurance operations are subject to risks and uncertainties, including claims, catastrophic events, underwriting risks, and dependence on a primary distribution channel.Insurance claims and policyholder liabilities are difficult to predict and may exceed the related reserves set aside for claims (losses) and associated expenses for claims adjudication (loss adjustment expenses). Additionally, events such as natural disasters, pandemic disease, cybersecurity breaches and other types of catastrophes, and prolonged economic downturns, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Other risks relating to our insurance operations include changes to laws and regulations applicable to us, as well as changes to the regulatory environment, such as: changes to laws or regulations affecting capital and reserve requirements; frequency and type of regulatory monitoring and reporting; consumer privacy, use of customer data and data security; benefits or loss ratio requirements; insurance producer licensing or appointment requirements; required disclosures to consumers; and collateral protection insurance (i.e., insurance some of our lender companies purchase, at the customer’s expense, on that customer’s loan collateral for the periods of time the customer fails to adequately, as required by the customer's loan, insure the collateral). Because our customers do not directly agree to the amount charged for collateral protection at the time it is purchased, regulators may in the future prohibit our insurance companies from providing this insurance to our lending operations. Moreover, our insurance companies are predominately dependent on our lending operations as the primary source of business and product distribution. If our lending operations discontinue offering insurance products, our insurance operations would need to find an alternate distribution partner for their products, of which there can be no assurance.Our use of derivatives exposes us to credit and market risks.From time to time, we may enter into derivative financial instruments for economic hedging purposes, such as managing our exposure to interest rate risk. By using derivative instruments, we are exposed to credit and market risks, including the risk of loss associated with variations in the spread between the asset yield and the funding and/or hedge cost, default risk, and the risk of insolvency or other inability of the counterparty to a particular derivative financial instrument to perform its obligations.23Table of Contents We may not be able to make technological improvements as quickly as some of our competitors, which could harm our ability to compete and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial and lending institutions to better serve customers and reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services as quickly as some of our competitors or be successful in marketing these products and services to our existing and new customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could harm our ability to compete and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.If goodwill and other intangible assets become impaired, it could have a negative impact on our profitability.Goodwill represents the amount of acquisition cost over the fair value of net assets we acquired. If the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Any such adjustments are reflected in our results of operations in the periods in which the impairments become known. There can be no assurance that our future evaluations of goodwill and other intangible assets will not result in findings of impairments and related write-downs, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 in this report for further information on goodwill and intangible asset impairment.Damage to our reputation could adversely impact our business and financial results.Our ability to attract and retain customers and employees is significantly impacted by our reputation. Damage to our reputation can arise as a result of our actions or those of our employees, or as a result of negative public opinion about the financial services industry. Negative public opinion may relate to any aspect of or risk associated with our business, including but not limited to, our lending practices, cybersecurity breaches, failures to safeguard personal information, discriminating or harassing behavior of employees, compensation practices, sales practices, environmental, social, and governance practices and disclosures, or failure or perceived failure to comply with laws or regulations. Negative publicity directed at us could generate dissatisfaction among our customers and employees. We cannot give assurance that our policies and procedures will be fully effective in preventing conduct that could damage our reputation. Furthermore, our actual or perceived failure to address or prevent any such conduct or otherwise to effectively manage our business or operations could result in significant reputational harm.There are risks associated with the acquisition or sale of assets or businesses and the formation, termination, or operation of joint ventures or other strategic alliances, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.We have previously acquired, and in the future may acquire, assets or businesses, either through the direct purchase of such assets or the purchase of a company’s equity. Since we will not have originated or serviced the finance receivables we acquire, we may not be aware of legal or other deficiencies related to origination or servicing, and our review of the portfolio prior to purchase may not uncover those deficiencies. Further, we may have limited recourse against the seller of the receivables.Potential difficulties we may encounter in connection with these transactions and arrangements include: the integration of the assets or business into our information technology platforms and servicing systems; the quality of servicing; disruption of our ongoing businesses and distraction of our management teams; incomplete or inaccurate records; inability to retain existing customers; unanticipated expenses; and potential unknown liabilities associated with the transactions, including legal liability related to origination and servicing prior to the acquisition.The anticipated benefits and synergies of any future acquisition will assume a successful integration, and will be based on projections and other assumptions, which are inherently uncertain. Even if integration is successful, anticipated benefits and synergies may not be achieved.24Table of Contents RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY AND REGULATIONWe operate in a highly competitive market, and we cannot ensure that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.The consumer finance industry is highly competitive. Our profitability depends, in large part, on our ability to underwrite and originate finance receivables. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than we possess. Some competitors may also have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that may not be available to us. We cannot give assurance that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.Our businesses are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business and failure to comply with such regulations may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.Our businesses are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations, and various state authorities regulate and supervise our lending business and insurance operations.We also must comply with extensive regulations in servicing our legacy real estate loans and loan portfolios for other parties and will have to comply with these servicing regulations if we acquire loan portfolios in the future for which we act as a servicer.Our operations are subject to regular examination by state regulators and U.S. federal and foreign regulators. These examinations may require us to change our policies or practices, pay monetary fines, or make reimbursements to customers. Many state regulators and some federal regulators have indicated an intention to pool their resources to conduct examinations of licensed entities, including us, at the same time (referred to as a “multi-state” examination). This could result in more in-depth examinations, which could be costlier and lead to more significant enforcement actions.We are also subject to potential enforcement, supervisions, and other actions that may be brought by state attorneys general or other state enforcement authorities and other governmental agencies. Such actions could subject us to civil money penalties, customer remediation, and increased compliance costs, as well as damage our reputation and brand and could limit or prohibit our ability to offer certain products and services or engage in certain business practices.State attorneys general have a variety of tools at their disposal to enforce state and federal consumer financial laws, including the ability to enforce the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act’s authority. State attorneys general also have enforcement authority under state law with respect to unfair or deceptive practices under which state attorneys general may conduct investigations, bring actions, and recover civil penalties or obtain injunctive relief against entities engaging in unfair, deceptive, or fraudulent acts. Attorneys general may also coordinate among themselves to enter into multi-state actions or settlements. Several consumer financial laws like the Truth in Lending Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act grant enforcement or litigation authority to state attorneys general.We are subject to potential changes in federal and state law, which could lower the interest-rate limit that non-depository financial institutions may charge for consumer loans or could expand the definition of interest under federal and state law to include the cost of optional products, such as insurance. Such changes could limit our interest income, insurance revenues, and other revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We may not be able to maintain all requisite licenses and permits, and the failure to satisfy those or other regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, changes in laws or regulations applicable to us could subject us to additional licensing, registration and other regulatory requirements in the future or could adversely affect our ability to operate or the way we conduct business.A material failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in regulatory actions, including substantial fines or penalties, lawsuits, and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.For more information with respect to the regulatory framework affecting our businesses, see “Business—Regulation” included in this report.25Table of Contents Requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and oversight by the CFPB significantly increase our regulatory costs and burdens.The Dodd-Frank Act and the related regulations increased oversight of financial services and products by the CFPB, and imposed restrictions on the allowable terms for certain consumer credit transactions. The CFPB has significant authority to implement and enforce federal consumer finance laws, including the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act and new requirements for financial services products provided for in the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the authority to identify and prohibit unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provides the CFPB with broad supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over various consumer financial products and services, including the ability to require reimbursements and other payments to customers for alleged legal violations, and to impose significant penalties, as well as injunctive relief that prohibits lenders from engaging in allegedly unlawful practices. Further, state attorneys general and state regulators are authorized to bring civil actions to enforce certain consumer protection provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The industry investigation and enforcement provisions of Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act may adversely affect our business if the CFPB or one or more state attorneys general or state regulators believe that we have violated any federal consumer financial protection laws, including the prohibition in Title X against unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices.The CFPB currently has supervisory authority over the Company as a mortgage servicer,and as a “larger participant” in the auto financing market. The larger-participant rule for consumer installment loans was one of the rulemaking initiatives the CFPB designated as inactive in its Spring 2018 rulemaking agenda. It is not known if or when the CFPB may consider reactivating the rulemaking process for the larger participant rule for consumer installment loans. It also has the authority to bring enforcement actions for violations of laws over which it has jurisdiction regardless of whether it has supervisory authority over an entity. The CFPB’s broad supervisory and enforcement powers could affect our business and operations significantly in terms of increased operating and regulatory compliance costs, and limits on the types of products we offer and the way they are offered, among other things.The CFPB and certain state regulators have acted against some lenders regarding, for instance, debt collection and the marketing of optional products offered by the lenders in connection with their loans. The products included debt cancellation/suspension products and other types of payment protection insurance. We collect on delinquent debt. We also sell optional insurance and non-insurance products in connection with our loans. Our debt collection practices and sales of optional insurance and non-insurance products could be challenged in a similar manner by the CFPB or state consumer lending regulators.Some of the rulemaking under the Dodd-Frank Act remains pending. As a result, the complete impact of the Dodd-Frank Act remains uncertain. It is not clear what form remaining regulations will ultimately take, or how our business will be affected.For more information with respect to the regulatory framework affecting our businesses and the CFPB, see “Business—Regulation” included in this report.Current and proposed regulations relating to consumer privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity could increase our costs.We are subject to federal and state consumer privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity laws and regulations. For example, we are subject to the federal GLBA and the NYDFS Cybersecurity Regulation, which govern the collection, processing, sharing, storage, use, and protection of PII and other confidential information by financial institutions and require certain safeguards, controls, policies, and processes for protecting PII and other confidential information. Moreover, various state laws and regulations may require us to notify customers, employees, state attorneys general, regulators, and others in the event of a security breach. Federal and state legislators and regulators are pursuing new guidance, laws, and regulations relating to consumer privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity. Compliance with current or future consumer privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity laws and regulations could result in higher compliance, technology, or other operating costs. Any violations of these laws and regulations may require us to change our business practices or operational structure. In this regard, on May 24, 2023, we entered into a consent order with the NYDFS relating primarily to a past examination of our cybersecurity policies from 2017 to early 2020. Pursuant to the consent order, we agreed to pay a $4.25 million civil penalty and represent that certain improvements to our cybersecurity controls and procedures had previously been completed. Any future violations of these laws and regulations could adversely impact our reputation and subject us to material legal claims, monetary penalties, sanctions, and obligations to compensate and/or notify customers, employees, state attorneys general, regulators, and others, or take other remedial actions.26Table of Contents Our use of third-party vendors is subject to regulatory review.The CFPB and other regulators have issued regulatory guidance focusing on the need for financial institutions to perform due diligence and ongoing monitoring of third-party vendor relationships, which increases the scope of management involvement and decreases the benefit that we receive from using third-party vendors. Moreover, if our regulators conclude that we have not met the standards for oversight of our third-party vendors, we could be subject to enforcement actions, civil monetary penalties, supervisory orders to cease and desist, or other remedial actions, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, federal and state regulators have scrutinized the practices of lead aggregators and providers.We purchase and sell finance receivables, including charged-off receivables and receivables where the borrower is in default. This practice could subject us to heightened regulatory scrutiny, which may expose us to legal action, cause us to incur losses and/or limit or impede our collection activity.As part of our business, we purchase and sell finance receivables. Some of these finance receivables may be in default (including in bankruptcy) or the debt may have been charged off as uncollectible. The CFPB and other regulators have significantly increased their scrutiny of the purchase and sale of debt, and collections practices undertaken by purchasers of debt, especially delinquent and charged-off debt. The CFPB has scrutinized sellers of debt for not maintaining sufficient documentation to support and verify the validity or amount of the debt. It has also scrutinized debt collectors for, among other things, their collection tactics, attempting to collect debts that no longer are valid, misrepresenting the amount of the debt and not having sufficient documentation to verify the validity or amount of the debt. Our purchases or sales of receivables could expose us to lawsuits or fines by regulators if we do not have sufficient documentation to support and verify the validity and amount of the finance receivables underlying these transactions, or if we or purchasers of our finance receivables use collection methods that are viewed as unfair or abusive. In addition, our collections could suffer, and we may incur additional expenses if we are required to change collection practices or stop collecting on certain debts because of a lawsuit or action on the part of regulators.Changes in law and regulatory developments could result in significant additional compliance costs relating to securitizations.The Dodd-Frank Act requires, among other things, that a securitizer retain at least a 5% economic interest in the credit risk of the securitized assets; this requirement has reduced and will continue to reduce the amount of financing obtained from such transactions. Furthermore, sponsors are prohibited from diluting the required risk retention by dividing the economic interest among multiple parties or hedging or transferring the credit risk the sponsor is required to maintain.Rules relating to securitizations rated by nationally-recognized statistical rating agencies require that the findings of any third-party due diligence service providers be made publicly available at least five business days prior to the first sale of securities, which has led and will continue to lead us to incur additional costs in connection with each securitization.We may have to constrain our business activities to avoid being deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act.The Investment Company Act regulates the manner in which “investment companies” are permitted to conduct their business activities. We believe we have conducted, and intend to continue to conduct, our business in a manner that does not result in the Company being characterized as an investment company, including relying on certain exemptions from registration as an investment company. We rely on guidance published by the SEC staff or on our analyses of such guidance to determine our qualification under these and other exemptions. To the extent that the SEC staff publishes new or different guidance with respect to these matters, we may be required to adjust our business operations accordingly, including inhibiting our ability to conduct our business operations. We cannot give assurance that the laws and regulations governing our Investment Company Act status or SEC guidance regarding the Investment Company Act will not change in a manner that adversely affects our operations. If we are deemed to be an investment company, we may attempt to seek exemptive relief from the SEC, which could impose significant costs on us. We may not receive such relief on a timely basis, if at all, and such relief may require us to modify or curtail our operations. If we are deemed to be an investment company, we may also be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted.27Table of Contents RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESSAn inability to access adequate sources of liquidity may adversely affect our ability to fund operational requirements and satisfy financial obligations.Our ability to access capital and credit may be significantly affected by disruption in the U.S. credit markets and any potential credit rating downgrades on our debt. In addition, the risk of volatility and uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic environment could continue to create significant volatility in, and uncertainty around access to the capital markets. Historically, we have funded our operations and repaid our debt and other obligations using funds collected from our finance receivable portfolio and new debt issuances. Our current corporate credit ratings are below investment grade and, as a result, our borrowing costs may further increase and our ability to borrow may be limited. In addition to issuing unsecured debt in the public and private markets, we have raised capital through securitization transactions and, although there can be no assurances that we will be able to complete additional securitizations or issue additional unsecured debt, we currently expect our near-term sources of capital markets funding to continue to derive from securitization transactions and unsecured debt offerings.Any future capital markets transactions will be dependent on our financial performance, as well as market conditions, which may result in receiving financing on terms less favorable to us than our existing financings. In addition, our access to future financing and our ability to refinance existing debt will depend on a variety of factors such as our financial performance, the general availability of credit, our credit ratings and credit capacity at the time we pursue such financing.If we are unable to complete additional securitization transactions or unsecured debt offerings on a timely basis or upon terms acceptable to us or otherwise access adequate sources of liquidity, our ability to fund our own operational requirements and satisfy financial obligations may be adversely affected.Our indebtedness is significant, which could affect our ability to meet our obligations under our debt instruments and could materially and adversely affect our business and ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry.Our significant indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:•it may require us to dedicate a larger portion of our cash flows from operations to pay our indebtedness, which reduces the funds available for other purposes, including finance receivable originations and capital returns;•it may limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing regulatory, business, and economic conditions;•it may limit our ability to incur additional borrowings or securitizations;•it may require us to seek to change the maturity, interest rate and other terms of our existing debt;•it may place us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors that are not as highly leveraged;•it may cause a downgrade of our debt and long-term corporate ratings; and•it may cause us to be more vulnerable to periods of negative or slow growth in the general economy or in our business.In addition, meeting our anticipated liquidity requirements is contingent upon our continued compliance with our existing debt agreements. An event of default or declaration of acceleration under one of our existing debt agreements could also result in an event of default and declaration of acceleration under certain of our other existing debt agreements. Such an acceleration of our debt would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to continue as a going concern. If our debt obligations increase, whether due to the increased cost of existing indebtedness or the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the consequences described above could be magnified. There can be no assurance that we will be able to repay or refinance our debt in the future.Certain of our outstanding notes contain covenants that restrict our operations and may inhibit our ability to grow our business and increase revenues.OMFC’s indenture and certain of OMFC’s notes contain a covenant that limits OMFC’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to create or incur liens. The restrictions may interfere with our ability to obtain additional financing or affect the way we structure such financing or engage in other business activities. A default and resulting acceleration of obligations could also result in an event of default and declaration of acceleration under certain of our other existing debt agreements. Such an acceleration of our debt would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to continue as a going concern. A default could also significantly limit our alternatives to refinance our indebtedness. This limitation may significantly restrict our financing options during times of either market distress or our financial distress, which are precisely the times when having financing options is most important.28Table of Contents The assessment of our liquidity is based upon significant judgments and estimates that could prove to be materially incorrect.In assessing our current financial position and developing operating plans, management has made significant judgments and estimates with respect to our liquidity, including but not limited to:•our ability to generate sufficient cash to service all of our outstanding debt;•our continued ability to access debt and securitization markets and other sources of funding on favorable terms;•our ability to complete on favorable terms, as needed, additional borrowings, securitizations, finance receivable portfolio sales, or other transactions to support liquidity, and the costs associated with these funding sources, including sales at less than carrying value and limits on the types of assets that can be securitized or sold, which would affect our profitability;•the potential for downgrade of our debt by rating agencies, which would have a negative impact on our cost of, and access to, capital;•our ability to comply with our debt covenants;•our ability to make capital returns to OMH's stockholders;•the amount of cash expected to be received from our finance receivable portfolio through collections (including prepayments) and receipt of finance charges;•the potential for declining financial flexibility and reduced income should we use more of our assets for securitizations and finance receivable portfolio sales; and•the potential for reduced income due to the possible deterioration of the credit quality of our finance receivable portfolios.Additionally, there are numerous risks to our financial results, liquidity, and capital raising and debt refinancing plans that are not quantified in our current liquidity forecasts. These risks include, but are not limited, to the following:•our inability to grow our personal loan portfolio with adequate profitability to fund operations, loan losses, and other expenses;•our inability to monetize assets including, but not limited to, our access to debt and securitization markets;•our inability to obtain the additional necessary funding to finance our operations;•the effect of current and potential new federal, state, and local laws, regulations, or regulatory policies and practices on our ability to conduct business or the way we conduct business, as well as changes that may result from increased regulatory scrutiny of the sub-prime lending industry;•potential liability relating to real estate and personal loans which we have sold or may sell in the future, or relating to securitized loans, if it is determined that there was a non-curable breach of a warranty made in connection with the transaction;•the potential for increasing costs and difficulty in servicing our loan portfolio because of heightened regulatory scrutiny of loan servicing and foreclosure practices in the industry generally;•the potential for additional unforeseen cash demands or acceleration of obligations;•reduced income due to loan modifications where the borrower’s interest rate is reduced, principal payments are deferred, or other concessions are made;•the potential for declines or volatility in bond and equity markets; and•the potential effect on us if the capital levels of our regulated and unregulated subsidiaries prove inadequate to support our business plans.The actual outcome of one or more of our plans could be materially different than expected or one or more of our significant judgments or estimates about the potential effects of these risks and uncertainties could prove to be materially incorrect. In the event of such an occurrence, if third-party financing is not available, our liquidity could be materially adversely affected, and as a result, substantial doubt could exist about our ability to continue as a going concern.29Table of Contents OMFC's credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to raise capital in the debt markets at attractive rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.S&P, Moody’s, and KBRA rate OMFC’s debt. Ratings reflect the rating agencies’ opinions of a company’s financial strength, operating performance, strategic position, and ability to meet its obligations. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating. If OMFC’s current ratings are downgraded, it will likely increase the interest rate that we would have to pay to raise money in the capital markets, making it more expensive for us to borrow money and adversely impacting our access to capital. As a result, a downgrade of OMFC's ratings could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.Our securitizations may expose us to financing and other risks, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to access the securitization market in the future, which may require us to seek more costly financing.We cannot give assurance that we will be able to complete additional securitizations if the securitization markets become constrained. In addition, the value of any subordinated securities that we may retain in our securitizations might be reduced or, in some cases, eliminated because of adverse changes in economic conditions or the financial markets.OMFC and OMFG currently act as the servicers with respect to the securitization trusts and related series of asset-backed securities. If OMFC or OMFG defaults in its servicing obligations, an early amortization event could occur with respect to the relevant asset-backed securities and OMFC or OMFG, as applicable, could be replaced as servicer. Servicer defaults include, for example, the failure of the servicer to make any payment, transfer or deposit in accordance with the securitization documents, a breach of representations, warranties or agreements made by the servicer under the securitization documents and the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the servicer. Such an early amortization event could damage our reputation and have materially adverse consequences on our liquidity and cost of funds.Rating agencies may also affect our ability to execute a securitization transaction or increase the costs we expect to incur from executing securitization transactions. Rating agencies could alter their ratings processes or criteria after we have accumulated finance receivables for securitization in a manner that effectively reduces the value of those finance receivables by increasing our financing costs or otherwise requiring that we incur additional costs to comply with those processes and criteria. We cannot control or predict what actions the rating agencies may take in this regard.Further, other matters, such as (i) accounting standards applicable to securitization transactions and (ii) capital and leverage requirements applicable to banks and other regulated financial institutions' asset-backed securities, could result in decreased investor demand for securities issued through our securitization transactions, or increased competition from other institutions that undertake securitization transactions. In addition, compliance with certain regulatory requirements, including but not limited to the Dodd-Frank Act and the Investment Company Act, may affect the type of securitizations that are completed and investors that we are able to market to.If it is not possible or economical for us to securitize our finance receivables in the future, we would need to seek alternative financing to support our operations and to meet our existing debt obligations, which may be less efficient and more expensive than raising capital via securitizations and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.RISKS RELATED TO OUR ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTUREOMH and OMFC are holding companies with no operations and rely on our operating subsidiaries to provide us with funds necessary to meet our financial obligations and enable us to pay dividends.Our principal assets are the equity interests we directly or indirectly hold in our operating subsidiaries, which own our operating assets. As a result, we are dependent on loans, dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries for funds to meet our financial obligations and enable OMH to pay dividends on its common stock. Our subsidiaries are legally distinct from us, and certain of our subsidiaries are prohibited or restricted from paying dividends or otherwise making funds available to us under certain conditions. For example, our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit their ability to pay dividends or make loans or advances to us, principally to protect policyholders, and certain of OMFC's debt agreements limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. If we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries, or if our subsidiaries do not generate sufficient cash from operations, we may be unable to meet our financial obligations or pay dividends, and the Board may exercise its discretion not to pay dividends.30Table of Contents OMH may not pay dividends on its common stock in the future, even if liquidity and leverage targets are met.While OMH intends to pay its minimum quarterly dividends, currently $1.00 per share, for the foreseeable future, all subsequent dividends will be reviewed and declared at the discretion of the Board and will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, cash flows, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applicable to the payment of dividends, and other considerations that the Board deems relevant. As a result, we cannot give assurance that OMH will continue to pay dividends on its common stock in future periods, even if liquidity and target leverage objectives are met. See our “Dividend Policy” in Part II - Item 5 of this report for further information on dividends. Certain provisions of our Stockholders Agreement, restated certificate of incorporation, and amended and restated bylaws could hinder, delay or prevent a change in control of OMH, which could adversely affect the price of OMH's common stock.The Stockholders Agreement, OMH's restated certificate of incorporation, and OMH’s amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of the Board. These provisions provide for:•a classified Board with staggered three-year terms;•certain rights with respect to the designation of directors for nomination and election to the Board, including the ability of Värde to appoint one director, for so long as Värde has beneficial ownership of less than 10% but at least 5% of the voting power of OMH;•removal of directors only for cause and only with the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the voting interest of stockholders entitled to vote;•no ability for stockholders to call special meetings of OMH's stockholders;•advance notice requirements by stockholders with respect to director nominations and actions to be taken at annual meetings;•the ability for stockholders to act outside a meeting by written consent only if unanimous; and•the issuance of blank check preferred stock by the Board from time to time in one or more series and to establish the terms, preferences and rights of any such series of preferred stock, all without approval of OMH stockholders. Nothing in OMH's restated certificate of incorporation precludes future issuances without stockholder approval of the authorized but unissued shares of OMH's common stock.These anti-takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to benefit from a change in control or change our management and Board and, as a result, may adversely affect the market price of OMH's common stock and the ability of public stockholders to realize any potential change of control premium.See additional information under “Business Overview” in Item 1 of this report. The terms of the Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement are described in OMH's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 25, 2018, and such Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Licensing and insurance laws and regulations may delay or impede purchases of OMH's common stock.Certain states in which we are licensed to originate loans and the state in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled (Texas) have laws and regulations that require regulatory approval for the acquisition of “control” of regulated entities. In addition, Texas insurance laws and regulations generally provide that no person may acquire control, directly or indirectly, of a domiciled insurer, unless the person has provided the required information to, and the acquisition is subsequently approved or not disapproved by the Department of Insurance (“DOI”). Under state insurance laws or regulations, there exists a presumption of “control” when an acquiring party acquires as little as 10% of the voting securities of a regulated entity or of a company which itself controls (directly or indirectly) a regulated entity (the threshold is 10% under the insurance statute of Texas). Therefore, any person acquiring 10% or more of OMH's common stock may need the prior approval of the Texas insurance and/or licensing regulators, or a determination from such regulators that “control” has not been acquired, which could significantly delay or otherwise impede their ability to complete such purchase. 31Table of Contents RISKS RELATED TO OMH'S COMMON STOCKThe market price and trading volume of OMH's common stock may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for OMH's stockholders.The market price of OMH's common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations and may decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of OMH's common stock include: variations in our quarterly or annual operating results; changes in our earnings estimates (if provided) or differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts; additions to, or departures of, key management personnel; and any increased indebtedness we may incur in the future.These factors may decrease the market price of OMH's common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Volatility in the market price of a company’s securities may result in securities class action litigation. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.Future offerings of debt or equity securities by us may adversely affect the market price of OMH's common stock.In the future, we may attempt to obtain financing or to further increase our capital resources by issuing additional shares of OMH's common stock or offering debt or other equity securities, including debt securities convertible into equity or shares of preferred stock. Future acquisitions could require substantial additional capital in excess of cash from operations.Issuing additional shares of OMH's common stock or other equity securities or securities convertible into equity may dilute the economic and voting rights of OMH's stockholders at the time of such issuance or reduce the market price of OMH's common stock or both.  Upon liquidation, holders of debt securities and preferred shares, if issued, and lenders with respect to other borrowings would receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of OMH's common stock. Debt securities convertible into equity could be subject to adjustments in the conversion ratio pursuant to which certain events may increase the number of equity securities issuable upon conversion. Preferred shares, if issued, could have a preference with respect to liquidating distributions or a preference with respect to dividend payments that could limit our ability to pay dividends to the holders of OMH's common stock. Thus, holders of OMH's common stock bear the risk that our future offerings may reduce the market price of OMH's common stock and dilute their stockholdings in us.The future issuance of additional common stock in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions or otherwise will dilute all other stockholdings.OMH may issue any or all of the shares of common stock authorized but unissued without any action or approval by OMH's stockholders, subject to certain exceptions. OMH also intends to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and may issue common stock in connection with any such acquisition. Any common stock issued in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions, the exercise of outstanding stock options or otherwise would dilute the percentage ownership held by existing OMH's stockholders.GENERAL RISKSWe are a party to various lawsuits and proceedings and may become a party to various lawsuits and proceedings in the future which, if resolved in a manner adverse to us, could have a material adverse effect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.In the normal course of business, we have been named, and may be named in the future, as a defendant in various legal actions, including governmental investigations, examinations or other proceedings, arising in connection with our business activities. Certain of the legal actions may include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. Some of these proceedings are pending in jurisdictions that permit damage awards disproportionate to the actual economic damages allegedly incurred. A large judgment that is adverse to us could cause our reputation to suffer, encourage additional lawsuits against us and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. For additional information regarding pending legal proceedings and other contingencies, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 in this report.32Table of Contents Certain operations rely on external vendors.We rely on third-party vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations, including a portion of our information systems, communication, data management and transaction processing. Accordingly, we are exposed to the risk that these vendors might not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements or service level agreements. Such failure to perform could be disruptive to our operations and have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These third parties are also sources of risk associated with operational errors, system interruptions or breaches and unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If our vendors encounter any of these issues, we could be exposed to disruption of service, damage to our reputation and litigation. If we lose the services of any of our key management personnel, our business could suffer.Our future success significantly depends on the continued service and performance of our key management personnel. Our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. Competition for these employees is intense and we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel. If we are unable to attract or retain appropriately qualified personnel, we may not be successful in originating loans and servicing our customers, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Employee misconduct could harm us by subjecting us to monetary loss, significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm.There is a risk that our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. For example, if an employee were to engage—or be accused of engaging—in illegal or suspicious activities including fraud or theft, we could suffer direct losses from such activity, and as a result, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial condition, customer relationships, and ability to attract future customers or employees. Regulators may allege or determine, based upon such misconduct, that our systems and procedures to detect and deter employee misconduct are inadequate. Misconduct by our employees, or even unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct, could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business.33Table of Contents"
0,OMF,ONEMAIN HOLDINGS INC,2023-02-10,"Risk Factors
.We face a variety of risks that are inherent in our business. In addition to the factors discussed in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC that could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, and results of operations, new risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our business or financial performance. Therefore, the risk factors below should not be considered a complete list of potential risks that we may face.Any risk factor described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any of our other SEC filings could by itself, or together with other factors, materially adversely affect our liquidity, competitive position, business, reputation, results of operations, or financial condition, including by materially increasing our expenses or decreasing our revenues, which could result in material losses.RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSOur financial condition and results of operations and our borrowers’ ability to make payments on their loans have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by economic conditions and other factors that we cannot control.Uncertainty and deterioration in general economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad historically have created a difficult operating environment for consumer lending. Many factors, including factors that are beyond our control, may impact our financial condition or results of operations and/or affect our borrowers’ willingness or capacity to make payments on their loans. These factors include: unemployment levels, housing markets, energy costs, inflation, and interest rates; events such as natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, or catastrophes; events that affect our borrowers, such as major medical expenses, divorce, or death; and the quality of any collateral underlying our finance receivables. If we experience a future economic downturn, or if we become affected by other events beyond our control, we may experience increased credit risks, significant reductions in revenues, earnings and cash flows, difficulties accessing capital, and a deterioration in the value of our investments.Moreover, our customers are primarily nonprime borrowers, who have historically been more likely to be affected, or more severely affected, by adverse macroeconomic conditions than prime borrowers. If a borrower defaults on a finance receivable held directly by us, we will bear a risk of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral, if any, and the outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest on the finance receivable, which could adversely affect our cash flows from operations. The cost to service our loans may also increase without a corresponding increase in our finance charge income.We also are exposed to geographic customer concentration risk. An economic downturn or catastrophic event that disproportionately affects certain geographic regions could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including the performance of our finance receivables portfolio. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for quantification of our largest concentrations of net finance receivables.We cannot give assurance that our policies and procedures for underwriting, processing, and servicing personal loans or credit cards will adequately adapt to adverse economic or other changes. If we fail to adapt to changing economic conditions or other factors, or if such changes adversely affect our borrowers’ willingness or capacity to repay their loans, our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity would be materially adversely affected.If our estimates of allowance for finance receivable losses are not adequate to absorb actual losses, our provision for finance receivable losses would increase, which could adversely affect our results of operations.We maintain an allowance for finance receivable losses, which is a critical accounting estimate and requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions to determine the appropriate level of allowance. To estimate the appropriate level of allowance for finance receivable losses, we consider known and relevant internal and external factors that affect finance receivable collectability, including the total amount of finance receivables outstanding, historical finance receivable charge-offs, our current collection patterns, and current and forecasted economic trends. Our methodology for establishing our allowance for finance receivable losses is based on the guidance from Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, which requires us to measure expected credit losses for financial assets at each reporting date. The allowance is primarily based on historical experience, current conditions, and our reasonable and supportable forecast of economic conditions. If customer behavior changes as a result of economic conditions and if we are unable to accurately 19Table of Contents predict how the unemployment rates, and general economic conditions may affect our allowance for finance receivable losses, our allowance for finance receivable losses may be inadequate. Our allowance for finance receivable losses is an estimate, and if actual finance receivable losses are materially greater than our allowance for finance receivable losses, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Neither state regulators nor federal regulators oversee our allowance for finance receivable losses.Our valuations may include methodologies, models, estimations, and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to financial assets and liabilities that may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We use estimates, assumptions, and judgments when certain financial assets and liabilities are measured and reported at fair value. Fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on quoted market prices and/or other observable inputs provided by independent third-party sources, when available. During periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain assets if trading becomes less frequent or market data becomes less observable. In such cases, certain asset valuations may require significant judgment, and may include inputs and assumptions that require greater estimation, including credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and other relevant inputs. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.Our risk management efforts may not be effective.We could incur substantial losses and our business operations could be disrupted if we are unable to effectively identify, manage, monitor, and mitigate financial risks, such as credit risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk, liquidity risk, and other market-related risks, as well as operational risks related to our business, assets, and liabilities. To the extent our models used to assess the creditworthiness of potential borrowers do not adequately identify potential risks, the valuations produced will not adequately represent the risk profile of the borrowers and could result in a riskier finance receivables profile than originally identified. Our risk management policies, procedures, and techniques, including our scoring technology, may not be sufficient to identify all of the risks we are exposed to, mitigate the risks we have identified, or identify concentrations of risk or additional risks to which we may become subject in the future. We also face evolving risks as a result of  the significant increase in our remote workforce and digital operations. These risks may not be adequately captured by our existing risk management framework.Changes in market conditions could adversely affect the rate at which our borrowers prepay their loans and the value of our finance receivables portfolio, as well as increase our financing cost, which could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.Changing market conditions, the availability of credit, the relative economic vitality of the area in which borrowers and their assets are located, changes in tax laws, other opportunities for investment available to our customers, homeowner mobility, and other economic, social, geographic, demographic, and legal factors beyond our control, may affect the rates at which our borrowers prepay their loans. Generally, in situations where prepayment rates have slowed, the weighted-average life of our finance receivables has increased. Any increase in interest rates may further slow the rate of prepayment for our finance receivables, which could adversely affect our liquidity by reducing the cash flows from, and the value of, the finance receivables we hold for sale or utilize as collateral in our secured funding transactions.Moreover, our finance receivables are fixed-rate and generally decline in value if interest rates increase. As such, if changing market conditions cause interest rates to increase substantially, the value of our finance receivables could decline. Some jurisdictions limit the maximum interest rate that we may charge on a certain population of our loans so we have limited ability to increase the interest rate on our loans made in those jurisdictions. Our yield, as well as our cash flows from operations and results of operations, could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to increase the interest rates charged on new loans to offset any increases in our cost of funds. Accordingly, any increase in interest rates could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.20Table of Contents We may be required to indemnify or repurchase finance receivables from purchasers of finance receivables that we have sold or securitized, or which we will sell or securitize in the future, if our finance receivables fail to meet certain criteria or characteristics or under other circumstances, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.The documents governing our finance receivable sales and securitizations contain provisions that require us to indemnify the purchasers of securitized finance receivables, or to repurchase the affected finance receivables, under certain circumstances. While our sale and securitization documents vary, they generally contain customary provisions that may require us to repurchase finance receivables if our representations and warranties concerning the quality and characteristics, including but not limited to regulatory requirements in connection with origination and servicing, of the finance receivable are inaccurate and there is borrower fraud.At its maximum, our exposure to repurchases or our indemnification obligations under our representations and warranties could include the current unpaid balance of all finance receivables that we have sold or securitized, and which are not subject to settlement agreements with purchasers.The risk of loss on the finance receivables that we have securitized is recognized in our allowance for finance receivable losses since all of our loan securitizations are recorded on our balance sheet. If we are required to indemnify purchasers or repurchase finance receivables that we sell or have sold and such indemnification or repurchase results in losses or recognition of losses on securitized finance receivables that exceed our recorded allowance for finance receivable losses associated with our securitizations, this could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.Our business and reputation may be materially impacted by information system failures, cyber-attacks, or network disruptions.Our business relies heavily on information systems to deliver products and services to our customers, and to manage our operations. These systems may encounter service disruptions due to system, network or software failure, security breaches, cyber-attacks, ransomware, computer viruses, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events, disruptions, or intrusions. In addition, denial-of-service attacks could overwhelm our internet sites and prevent us from adequately serving customers. Cyber-attacks, including ransomware, are constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. We also may face new or heightened risk due to the increase in our remote workforce and digital operations. We may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities, which may allow them to persist in our system environment over long periods of time. Cyber-attacks can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our computer systems and networks and those of our third-party vendors. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and our business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient to adequately address the disruption. A disruption could impair our ability to offer and process our loans, provide customer service, perform collections or other necessary business activities, which could result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. There may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personally identifiable information (PII), that could subject us to significant reputational, financial, legal, and operational consequences.Our operations rely heavily on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential customer and other information including, among other things, PII, in our computer systems and networks, as well as those of third parties. Our branch locations and centralized servicing centers, as well as our administrative and executive offices, are part of an electronic information network that is designed to permit us to originate and track finance receivables and collections and perform other tasks that are part of our everyday operations. Additionally, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the significant increase in our remote workforce and digital operations, our vulnerability to unauthorized access to confidential information may increase. We devote significant resources to network and data security, including using encryption, access controls, authentication, and other security measures intended to protect our computer systems and data. These security measures may not be sufficient and may be vulnerable to hacking, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management, or other irregularities. Any failure, interruption, or breach in our cybersecurity could result in reputational harm, disruption of our customer relationships, or our inability to originate, process and service our finance receivable products, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. 21Table of Contents Further, any of these cybersecurity and operational risks could expose us to lawsuits by customers for identity theft or other damages resulting from data breach involving PII or misuse of their PII and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. In addition, regulators may impose penalties and/or require remedial action if they identify weaknesses in our security systems, and we may be required to incur significant costs to increase our cybersecurity to address any vulnerabilities that may be discovered or to remediate the harm caused by any security breaches. As part of our business, we may share confidential customer information and proprietary information with customers, vendors, service providers, and business partners. The information systems of these third parties may be vulnerable to security breaches and, despite our best efforts, we may not be able to ensure that these third parties have appropriate security controls in place to protect the information we share with them. If our confidential information is intercepted, stolen, misused, or mishandled while in possession of a third-party, it could result in reputational harm to us, loss of customer business, and additional regulatory scrutiny, and it could expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Although we have insurance that is intended to cover certain losses from such events, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate or available.We are also subject to the theft or misuse of physical customer and employee records at our facilities.Our branch locations and centralized servicing centers have physical customer records necessary for day-to-day operations that contain confidential information about our customers. We also retain physical records in various storage locations. The loss or theft of customer information from our branch locations, central servicing facilities, or other storage locations could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and penalties and could expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. In addition, if we cannot locate original documents (or copies, in some cases) for certain finance receivables, we may not be able to collect on those finance receivables.Our insurance operations are subject to risks and uncertainties, including claims, catastrophic events, underwriting risks, and dependence on a primary distribution channel.Insurance claims and policyholder liabilities are difficult to predict and may exceed the related reserves set aside for claims (losses) and associated expenses for claims adjudication (loss adjustment expenses). Additionally, events such as natural disasters, pandemic disease, cyber security breaches and other types of catastrophes, and prolonged economic downturns, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Other risks relating to our insurance operations include changes to laws and regulations applicable to us, as well as changes to the regulatory environment, such as: changes to laws or regulations affecting capital and reserve requirements; frequency and type of regulatory monitoring and reporting; consumer privacy, use of customer data and data security; benefits or loss ratio requirements; insurance producer licensing or appointment requirements; required disclosures to consumers; and collateral protection insurance (i.e., insurance some of our lender companies purchase, at the customer’s expense, on that customer’s loan collateral for the periods of time the customer fails to adequately, as required by the customer's loan, insure the collateral). Because our customers do not directly agree to the amount charged for collateral protection at the time it is purchased, regulators may in the future prohibit our insurance companies from providing this insurance to our lending operations. Moreover, our insurance companies are predominately dependent on our lending operations as the primary source of business and product distribution. If our lending operations discontinue offering insurance products, our insurance operations would need to find an alternate distribution partner for their products, of which there can be no assurance.Our use of derivatives exposes us to credit and market risks.From time to time, we may enter into derivative financial instruments for economic hedging purposes, such as managing our exposure to interest rate risk. By using derivative instruments, we are exposed to credit and market risks, including the risk of loss associated with variations in the spread between the asset yield and the funding and/or hedge cost, default risk, and the risk of insolvency or other inability of the counterparty to a particular derivative financial instrument to perform its obligations.22Table of Contents We may not be able to make technological improvements as quickly as some of our competitors, which could harm our ability to compete and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial and lending institutions to better serve customers and reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services as quickly as some of our competitors or be successful in marketing these products and services to our existing and new customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could harm our ability to compete and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.If goodwill and other intangible assets become impaired, it could have a negative impact on our profitability.Goodwill represents the amount of acquisition cost over the fair value of net assets we acquired. If the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Any such adjustments are reflected in our results of operations in the periods in which the impairments become known. There can be no assurance that our future evaluations of goodwill and other intangible assets will not result in findings of impairments and related write-downs, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for further information on goodwill and intangible asset impairment.Damage to our reputation could adversely impact our business and financial results.Our ability to attract and retain customers and employees is significantly impacted by our reputation. Damage to our reputation can arise as a result of our actions or those of our employees, or as a result of negative public opinion about the financial services industry. Negative public opinion may relate to any aspect of or risk associated with our business, including but not limited to, our lending practices, cybersecurity breaches, failures to safeguard personal information, discriminating or harassing behavior of employees, compensation practices, sales practices, environmental, social, and governance practices and disclosures, or failure or perceived failure to comply with laws or regulations. Negative publicity directed at us could generate dissatisfaction among our customers and employees. We cannot give assurance that our policies and procedures will be fully effective in preventing conduct that could damage our reputation. Furthermore, our actual or perceived failure to address or prevent any such conduct or otherwise to effectively manage our business or operations could result in significant reputational harm.There are risks associated with the acquisition or sale of assets or businesses and the formation, termination, or operation of joint ventures or other strategic alliances, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.We have previously acquired, and in the future may acquire, assets or businesses, either through the direct purchase of such assets or the purchase of a company’s equity. Since we will not have originated or serviced the finance receivables we acquire, we may not be aware of legal or other deficiencies related to origination or servicing, and our review of the portfolio prior to purchase may not uncover those deficiencies. Further, we may have limited recourse against the seller of the receivables.Potential difficulties we may encounter in connection with these transactions and arrangements include: the integration of the assets or business into our information technology platforms and servicing systems; the quality of servicing; disruption of our ongoing businesses and distraction of our management teams; incomplete or inaccurate records; inability to retain existing customers; unanticipated expenses; and potential unknown liabilities associated with the transactions, including legal liability related to origination and servicing prior to the acquisition.The anticipated benefits and synergies of any future acquisition will assume a successful integration, and will be based on projections and other assumptions, which are inherently uncertain. Even if integration is successful, anticipated benefits and synergies may not be achieved.23Table of Contents The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to adversely affect consumer finance businesses including OneMain. The virus causing COVID-19 was identified in late 2019 and was declared a global pandemic in March 2020. Governmental authorities took a number of steps to combat or slow the spread of COVID-19. Efforts to combat the virus continue to be complicated by viral variants and uneven global access to and acceptance of vaccines. These measures have and may continue to impact all or portions of the Company’s workforce and our current and prospective customers. While many of the restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic have largely been eased, uncertainty continues to exist regarding such measures and potential future measures. In response to COVID-19, we modified our business practices with a portion of our employees working remotely to minimize interruptions in our business. Although these changes have allowed us to continue operations safely, the technology in home environments may not be as robust as in our offices and could cause networks, information systems, applications, and other tools available to employees to be more limited or less reliable than in our offices. The continuation of these work-from-home measures also introduces additional operational risk, including increased cybersecurity risk from phishing, malware, and other cybersecurity attacks, all of which could expose us to risks of data or financial loss and could seriously disrupt our operations and the operations of any impacted customers. Legal and regulatory responses to concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic could result in additional regulation or restrictions affecting the conduct of our business in the future. All of the foregoing may adversely affect our income and other results of operations, make collection of our finance receivables more difficult, or reduce income received from such receivables or our ability to obtain financing with respect to such receivables.The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. Volatility stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively affect our net interest income, lending activities, and profitability. Likewise, market volatility, as well as general economic, market, or social conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, could reduce the market price of shares of our common stock regardless of our operating performance.Additionally, to the extent that the pandemic harms our business and results of operations, many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors
” section may be heightened.RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY AND REGULATIONWe operate in a highly competitive market, and we cannot ensure that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.The consumer finance industry is highly competitive. Our profitability depends, in large part, on our ability to underwrite and originate finance receivables. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than we possess. Some competitors may also have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that may not be available to us. We cannot give assurance that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.Our businesses are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business and failure to comply with such regulations may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.Our businesses are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations, and various state authorities regulate and supervise our lending business and insurance operations.We also must comply with extensive regulations in servicing our legacy real estate loans and loan portfolios for other parties and will have to comply with these servicing regulations if we acquire loan portfolios in the future for which we act as a servicer.Our operations are subject to regular examination by state regulators and, for certain aspects of our business, by U.S. federal and foreign regulators. These examinations may require us to change our policies or practices, pay monetary fines, or make reimbursements to customers. Many state regulators and some federal regulators have indicated an intention to pool their resources to conduct examinations of licensed entities, including us, at the same time (referred to as a “multi-state” examination). This could result in more in-depth examinations, which could be costlier and lead to more significant enforcement actions.24Table of Contents We are also subject to potential enforcement, supervisions, and other actions that may be brought by state attorneys general or other state enforcement authorities and other governmental agencies. Such actions could subject us to civil money penalties, customer remediation, and increased compliance costs, as well as damage our reputation and brand and could limit or prohibit our ability to offer certain products and services or engage in certain business practices.State attorneys general have a variety of tools at their disposal to enforce state and federal consumer financial laws, including the ability to enforce the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act’s authority. State attorneys general also have enforcement authority under state law with respect to unfair or deceptive practices under which state attorneys general may conduct investigations, bring actions, and recover civil penalties or obtain injunctive relief against entities engaging in unfair, deceptive, or fraudulent acts. Attorneys general may also coordinate among themselves to enter into multi-state actions or settlements. Several consumer financial laws like the Truth in Lending Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act grant enforcement or litigation authority to state attorneys general.We are subject to potential changes in federal and state law, which could lower the interest-rate limit that non-depository financial institutions may charge for consumer loans or could expand the definition of interest under federal and state law to include the cost of optional products, such as insurance. Such changes could limit our interest income, insurance revenues, and other revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We may not be able to maintain all requisite licenses and permits, and the failure to satisfy those or other regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, changes in laws or regulations applicable to us could subject us to additional licensing, registration and other regulatory requirements in the future or could adversely affect our ability to operate or the way we conduct business.A material failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in regulatory actions, including substantial fines or penalties, lawsuits, and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.For more information with respect to the regulatory framework affecting our businesses, see “Business—Regulation” included in this report.Requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and oversight by the CFPB significantly increase our regulatory costs and burdens.The Dodd-Frank Act and the related regulations increased oversight of financial services and products by the CFPB, and imposed restrictions on the allowable terms for certain consumer credit transactions. The CFPB has significant authority to implement and enforce federal consumer finance laws, including the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act and new requirements for financial services products provided for in the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the authority to identify and prohibit unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provides the CFPB with broad supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over various consumer financial products and services, including the ability to require reimbursements and other payments to customers for alleged legal violations, and to impose significant penalties, as well as injunctive relief that prohibits lenders from engaging in allegedly unlawful practices. Further, state attorneys general and state regulators are authorized to bring civil actions to enforce certain consumer protection provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The industry investigation and enforcement provisions of Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act may adversely affect our business if the CFPB or one or more state attorneys general or state regulators believe that we have violated any federal consumer financial protection laws, including the prohibition in Title X against unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices.The CFPB currently has supervisory authority over our real estate servicing activities, and may in the future have supervisory authority over other parts of our consumer lending business. It also has the authority to bring enforcement actions for violations of laws over which it has jurisdiction regardless of whether it has supervisory authority for a given product or service. The Dodd-Frank Act also gives the CFPB supervisory authority over entities that are designated as “larger participants” in certain financial services markets. The CFPB has published regulations for “larger participants” in the market of auto finance, and we have been designated as a larger participant in this market. The larger-participant rule for consumer installment loans was one of the rulemaking initiatives the CFPB designated as inactive in its Spring 2018 rulemaking agenda. It is not known if or when the CFPB may consider reactivating the rulemaking process for the larger participant rule for consumer installment loans. The CFPB’s broad supervisory and enforcement powers could affect our business and operations significantly in terms of increased operating and regulatory compliance costs, and limits on the types of products we offer and the way they are offered, among other things.25Table of Contents The CFPB and certain state regulators have acted against some lenders regarding, for instance, debt collection and the marketing of optional products offered by the lenders in connection with their loans. The products included debt cancellation/suspension products and other types of payment protection insurance. We collect on delinquent debt. We also sell optional insurance and non-insurance products in connection with our loans. Our debt collection practices and sales of optional insurance and non-insurance products could be challenged in a similar manner by the CFPB or state consumer lending regulators.Some of the rulemaking under the Dodd-Frank Act remains pending. As a result, the complete impact of the Dodd-Frank Act remains uncertain. It is not clear what form remaining regulations will ultimately take, or how our business will be affected.For more information with respect to the regulatory framework affecting our businesses and the CFPB, see “Business—Regulation” included in this report.Current and proposed regulations relating to consumer privacy, data protection, and information security could increase our costs.We are subject to federal and state consumer privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations. For example, we are subject to the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the New York Cybersecurity Regulation, which govern the use of PII by financial institutions and require certain safeguards for protecting PII. Moreover, various state laws and regulations may require us to notify customers, employees, state attorneys general, regulators, and others in the event of a security breach. Federal and state legislators and regulators are pursuing new guidance, laws, and regulations relating to consumer privacy, data protection, and information security. Compliance with current or future consumer privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations could result in higher compliance, technology, or other operating costs. Any violations of these laws and regulations may require us to change our business practices or operational structure. Violations could subject us to material legal claims, monetary penalties, sanctions, and obligations to compensate and/or notify customers, employees, state attorneys general, regulators, and others, or take other remedial actions.Our use of third-party vendors is subject to regulatory review.The CFPB and other regulators have issued regulatory guidance focusing on the need for financial institutions to perform due diligence and ongoing monitoring of third-party vendor relationships, which increases the scope of management involvement and decreases the benefit that we receive from using third-party vendors. Moreover, if our regulators conclude that we have not met the standards for oversight of our third-party vendors, we could be subject to enforcement actions, civil monetary penalties, supervisory orders to cease and desist, or other remedial actions, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, federal and state regulators have scrutinized the practices of lead aggregators and providers.We purchase and sell finance receivables, including charged-off receivables and receivables where the borrower is in default. This practice could subject us to heightened regulatory scrutiny, which may expose us to legal action, cause us to incur losses and/or limit or impede our collection activity.As part of our business, we purchase and sell finance receivables. Some of these finance receivables may be in default (including in bankruptcy) or the debt may have been charged off as uncollectible. The CFPB and other regulators have significantly increased their scrutiny of the purchase and sale of debt, and collections practices undertaken by purchasers of debt, especially delinquent and charged-off debt. The CFPB has scrutinized sellers of debt for not maintaining sufficient documentation to support and verify the validity or amount of the debt. It has also scrutinized debt collectors for, among other things, their collection tactics, attempting to collect debts that no longer are valid, misrepresenting the amount of the debt and not having sufficient documentation to verify the validity or amount of the debt. Our purchases or sales of receivables could expose us to lawsuits or fines by regulators if we do not have sufficient documentation to support and verify the validity and amount of the finance receivables underlying these transactions, or if we or purchasers of our finance receivables use collection methods that are viewed as unfair or abusive. In addition, our collections could suffer, and we may incur additional expenses if we are required to change collection practices or stop collecting on certain debts because of a lawsuit or action on the part of regulators.26Table of Contents Changes in law and regulatory developments could result in significant additional compliance costs relating to securitizations.The Dodd-Frank Act requires, among other things, that a securitizer retain at least a 5% economic interest in the credit risk of the securitized assets; this requirement has reduced and will continue to reduce the amount of financing obtained from such transactions. Furthermore, sponsors are prohibited from diluting the required risk retention by dividing the economic interest among multiple parties or hedging or transferring the credit risk the sponsor is required to maintain.Rules relating to securitizations rated by nationally-recognized statistical rating agencies require that the findings of any third-party due diligence service providers be made publicly available at least five business days prior to the first sale of securities, which has led and will continue to lead us to incur additional costs in connection with each securitization.We may have to constrain our business activities to avoid being deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act.The Investment Company Act regulates the manner in which “investment companies” are permitted to conduct their business activities. We believe we have conducted, and intend to continue to conduct, our business in a manner that does not result in the Company being characterized as an investment company, including relying on certain exemptions from registration as an investment company. We rely on guidance published by the SEC staff or on our analyses of such guidance to determine our qualification under these and other exemptions. To the extent that the SEC staff publishes new or different guidance with respect to these matters, we may be required to adjust our business operations accordingly, including inhibiting our ability to conduct our business operations. We cannot give assurance that the laws and regulations governing our Investment Company Act status or SEC guidance regarding the Investment Company Act will not change in a manner that adversely affects our operations. If we are deemed to be an investment company, we may attempt to seek exemptive relief from the SEC, which could impose significant costs on us. We may not receive such relief on a timely basis, if at all, and such relief may require us to modify or curtail our operations. If we are deemed to be an investment company, we may also be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted.RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESSAn inability to access adequate sources of liquidity may adversely affect our ability to fund operational requirements and satisfy financial obligations.Our ability to access capital and credit may be significantly affected by disruption in the U.S. credit markets and any potential credit rating downgrades on our debt. In addition, the risk of volatility and uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic environment could continue to create significant volatility in, and uncertainty around access to the capital markets. Historically, we have funded our operations and repaid our debt and other obligations using funds collected from our finance receivable portfolio and new debt issuances. Our current corporate credit ratings are below investment grade and, as a result, our borrowing costs may further increase and our ability to borrow may be limited. In addition to issuing unsecured debt in the public and private markets, we have raised capital through securitization transactions and, although there can be no assurances that we will be able to complete additional securitizations or issue additional unsecured debt, we currently expect our near-term sources of capital markets funding to continue to derive from securitization transactions and unsecured debt offerings.Any future capital markets transactions will be dependent on our financial performance as well as market conditions, which may result in receiving financing on terms less favorable to us than our existing financings. In addition, our access to future financing and our ability to refinance existing debt will depend on a variety of factors such as our financial performance, the general availability of credit, our credit ratings and credit capacity at the time we pursue such financing.If we are unable to complete additional securitization transactions or unsecured debt offerings on a timely basis or upon terms acceptable to us or otherwise access adequate sources of liquidity, our ability to fund our own operational requirements and satisfy financial obligations may be adversely affected.27Table of Contents Our indebtedness is significant, which could affect our ability to meet our obligations under our debt instruments and could materially and adversely affect our business and ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry.Our significant indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:•it may require us to dedicate a larger portion of our cash flows from operations to pay our indebtedness, which reduces the funds available for other purposes, including finance receivable originations and capital returns;•it may limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing regulatory, business, and economic conditions;•it may limit our ability to incur additional borrowings or securitizations;•it may require us to seek to change the maturity, interest rate and other terms of our existing debt;•it may place us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors that are not as highly leveraged;•it may cause a downgrade of our debt and long-term corporate ratings; and•it may cause us to be more vulnerable to periods of negative or slow growth in the general economy or in our business.In addition, meeting our anticipated liquidity requirements is contingent upon our continued compliance with our existing debt agreements. An event of default or declaration of acceleration under one of our existing debt agreements could also result in an event of default and declaration of acceleration under certain of our other existing debt agreements. Such an acceleration of our debt would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to continue as a going concern. If our debt obligations increase, whether due to the increased cost of existing indebtedness or the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the consequences described above could be magnified. There can be no assurance that we will be able to repay or refinance our debt in the future.Certain of our outstanding notes contain covenants that restrict our operations and may inhibit our ability to grow our business and increase revenues.OMFC’s indenture and certain of OMFC’s notes contain a covenant that limits OMFC’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to create or incur liens. The restrictions may interfere with our ability to obtain additional financing or affect the way we structure such financing or engage in other business activities. A default and resulting acceleration of obligations could also result in an event of default and declaration of acceleration under certain of our other existing debt agreements. Such an acceleration of our debt would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to continue as a going concern. A default could also significantly limit our alternatives to refinance our indebtedness. This limitation may significantly restrict our financing options during times of either market distress or our financial distress, which are precisely the times when having financing options is most important.The assessment of our liquidity is based upon significant judgments and estimates that could prove to be materially incorrect.In assessing our current financial position and developing operating plans, management has made significant judgments and estimates with respect to our liquidity, including but not limited to:•our ability to generate sufficient cash to service all of our outstanding debt;•our continued ability to access debt and securitization markets and other sources of funding on favorable terms;•our ability to complete on favorable terms, as needed, additional borrowings, securitizations, finance receivable portfolio sales, or other transactions to support liquidity, and the costs associated with these funding sources, including sales at less than carrying value and limits on the types of assets that can be securitized or sold, which would affect our profitability;•the potential for downgrade of our debt by rating agencies, which would have a negative impact on our cost of, and access to, capital;•our ability to comply with our debt covenants;•our ability to make capital returns to OMH's stockholders;•the amount of cash expected to be received from our finance receivable portfolio through collections (including prepayments) and receipt of finance charges;•the potential for declining financial flexibility and reduced income should we use more of our assets for securitizations and finance receivable portfolio sales; and•the potential for reduced income due to the possible deterioration of the credit quality of our finance receivable portfolios.28Table of Contents Additionally, there are numerous risks to our financial results, liquidity, and capital raising and debt refinancing plans that are not quantified in our current liquidity forecasts. These risks include, but are not limited, to the following:•our inability to grow our personal loan portfolio with adequate profitability to fund operations, loan losses, and other expenses;•our inability to monetize assets including, but not limited to, our access to debt and securitization markets;•our inability to obtain the additional necessary funding to finance our operations;•the effect of current and potential new federal, state, and local laws, regulations, or regulatory policies and practices on our ability to conduct business or the way we conduct business, as well as changes that may result from increased regulatory scrutiny of the sub-prime lending industry;•potential liability relating to real estate and personal loans which we have sold or may sell in the future, or relating to securitized loans, if it is determined that there was a non-curable breach of a warranty made in connection with the transaction;•the potential for increasing costs and difficulty in servicing our loan portfolio because of heightened regulatory scrutiny of loan servicing and foreclosure practices in the industry generally;•the potential for additional unforeseen cash demands or acceleration of obligations;•reduced income due to loan modifications where the borrower’s interest rate is reduced, principal payments are deferred, or other concessions are made;•the potential for declines or volatility in bond and equity markets; and•the potential effect on us if the capital levels of our regulated and unregulated subsidiaries prove inadequate to support our business plans.The actual outcome of one or more of our plans could be materially different than expected or one or more of our significant judgments or estimates about the potential effects of these risks and uncertainties could prove to be materially incorrect. In the event of such an occurrence, if third-party financing is not available, our liquidity could be materially adversely affected, and as a result, substantial doubt could exist about our ability to continue as a going concern.OMFC's credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to raise capital in the debt markets at attractive rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.S&P, Moody’s, and KBRA rate OMFC’s debt. Ratings reflect the rating agencies’ opinions of a company’s financial strength, operating performance, strategic position, and ability to meet its obligations. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating. If OMFC’s current ratings are downgraded, it will likely increase the interest rate that we would have to pay to raise money in the capital markets, making it more expensive for us to borrow money and adversely impacting our access to capital. As a result, a downgrade of OMFC's ratings could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.Our securitizations may expose us to financing and other risks, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to access the securitization market in the future, which may require us to seek more costly financing.We cannot give assurance that we will be able to complete additional securitizations if the securitization markets become constrained. In addition, the value of any subordinated securities that we may retain in our securitizations might be reduced or, in some cases, eliminated because of adverse changes in economic conditions or the financial markets.OMFC and OMFG currently act as the servicers with respect to the personal loan securitization trusts and related series of asset-backed securities. If OMFC or OMFG defaults in its servicing obligations, an early amortization event could occur with respect to the relevant asset-backed securities and OMFC or OMFG, as applicable, could be replaced as servicer. Servicer defaults include, for example, the failure of the servicer to make any payment, transfer or deposit in accordance with the securitization documents, a breach of representations, warranties or agreements made by the servicer under the securitization documents and the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the servicer. Such an early amortization event could damage our reputation and have materially adverse consequences on our liquidity and cost of funds.Rating agencies may also affect our ability to execute a securitization transaction or increase the costs we expect to incur from executing securitization transactions. Rating agencies could alter their ratings processes or criteria after we have accumulated 29Table of Contents finance receivables for securitization in a manner that effectively reduces the value of those finance receivables by increasing our financing costs or otherwise requiring that we incur additional costs to comply with those processes and criteria. We cannot control or predict what actions the rating agencies may take in this regard.Further, other matters, such as (i) accounting standards applicable to securitization transactions and (ii) capital and leverage requirements applicable to banks and other regulated financial institutions' asset-backed securities, could result in decreased investor demand for securities issued through our securitization transactions, or increased competition from other institutions that undertake securitization transactions. In addition, compliance with certain regulatory requirements, including but not limited to the Dodd-Frank Act and the Investment Company Act, may affect the type of securitizations that are completed and investors that we are able to market to.If it is not possible or economical for us to securitize our finance receivables in the future, we would need to seek alternative financing to support our operations and to meet our existing debt obligations, which may be less efficient and more expensive than raising capital via securitizations and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.RISKS RELATED TO OUR ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTUREOMH and OMFC are holding companies with no operations and rely on our operating subsidiaries to provide us with funds necessary to meet our financial obligations and enable us to pay dividends.Our principal assets are the equity interests we directly or indirectly hold in our operating subsidiaries, which own our operating assets. As a result, we are dependent on loans, dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries for funds to meet our financial obligations and enable OMH to pay dividends on its common stock. Our subsidiaries are legally distinct from us, and certain of our subsidiaries are prohibited or restricted from paying dividends or otherwise making funds available to us under certain conditions. For example, our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit their ability to pay dividends or make loans or advances to us, principally to protect policyholders, and certain of OMFC's debt agreements limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. If we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries, or if our subsidiaries do not generate sufficient cash from operations, we may be unable to meet our financial obligations or pay dividends, and the Board may exercise its discretion not to pay dividends.OMH may not pay dividends on its common stock in the future, even if liquidity and leverage targets are met.While OMH intends to pay its minimum quarterly dividends, currently $1.00 per share, for the foreseeable future, all subsequent dividends will be reviewed and declared at the discretion of the Board and will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, cash flows, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applicable to the payment of dividends, and other considerations that the Board deems relevant. As a result, we cannot give assurance that OMH will continue to pay dividends on its common stock in future periods, even if liquidity and target leverage objectives are met. See our “Dividend Policy” in Part II - Item 5 of this report for further information on dividends. Certain provisions of our Stockholders Agreement, restated certificate of incorporation, and amended and restated bylaws could hinder, delay or prevent a change in control of OMH, which could adversely affect the price of OMH's common stock.The Stockholders Agreement, OMH's restated certificate of incorporation, and OMH’s amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of the Board. These provisions provide for:•a classified Board with staggered three-year terms;•certain rights with respect to the designation of directors for nomination and election to the Board, including the ability of Värde to appoint one director, for so long as Värde has beneficial ownership of less than 10% but at least 5% of the voting power of OMH;•removal of directors only for cause and only with the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the voting interest of stockholders entitled to vote;•no ability for stockholders to call special meetings of OMH's stockholders;•advance notice requirements by stockholders with respect to director nominations and actions to be taken at annual meetings;•the ability for stockholders to act outside a meeting by written consent only if unanimous; and30Table of Contents •the issuance of blank check preferred stock by the Board from time to time in one or more series and to establish the terms, preferences and rights of any such series of preferred stock, all without approval of OMH stockholders. Nothing in OMH's restated certificate of incorporation precludes future issuances without stockholder approval of the authorized but unissued shares of OMH's common stock.These anti-takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to benefit from a change in control or change our management and Board and, as a result, may adversely affect the market price of OMH's common stock and the ability of public stockholders to realize any potential change of control premium.See additional information under “Business Overview” in Item 1 of this report. The terms of the Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement are described in OMH's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 25, 2018, and such Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Licensing and insurance laws and regulations may delay or impede purchases of OMH's common stock.Certain states in which we are licensed to originate loans and the state in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled (Texas) have laws and regulations that require regulatory approval for the acquisition of “control” of regulated entities. In addition, Texas insurance laws and regulations generally provide that no person may acquire control, directly or indirectly, of a domiciled insurer, unless the person has provided the required information to, and the acquisition is subsequently approved or not disapproved by the Department of Insurance (“DOI”). Under state insurance laws or regulations, there exists a presumption of “control” when an acquiring party acquires as little as 10% of the voting securities of a regulated entity or of a company which itself controls (directly or indirectly) a regulated entity (the threshold is 10% under the insurance statute of Texas). Therefore, any person acquiring 10% or more of OMH's common stock may need the prior approval of the Texas insurance and/or licensing regulators, or a determination from such regulators that “control” has not been acquired, which could significantly delay or otherwise impede their ability to complete such purchase. RISKS RELATED TO OMH'S COMMON STOCKThe market price and trading volume of OMH's common stock may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for OMH's stockholders.The market price of OMH's common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations and may decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of OMH's common stock include: variations in our quarterly or annual operating results; changes in our earnings estimates (if provided) or differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts; additions to, or departures of, key management personnel; and any increased indebtedness we may incur in the future.These factors may decrease the market price of OMH's common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Volatility in the market price of a company’s securities may result in securities class action litigation. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.Future offerings of debt or equity securities by us may adversely affect the market price of OMH's common stock.In the future, we may attempt to obtain financing or to further increase our capital resources by issuing additional shares of OMH's common stock or offering debt or other equity securities, including debt securities convertible into equity or shares of preferred stock. Future acquisitions could require substantial additional capital in excess of cash from operations.Issuing additional shares of OMH's common stock or other equity securities or securities convertible into equity may dilute the economic and voting rights of OMH's stockholders at the time of such issuance or reduce the market price of OMH's common stock or both.  Upon liquidation, holders of debt securities and preferred shares, if issued, and lenders with respect to other borrowings would receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of OMH's common stock. Debt securities convertible into equity could be subject to adjustments in the conversion ratio pursuant to which certain events may increase the number of equity securities issuable upon conversion. Preferred shares, if issued, could have a preference with respect to liquidating distributions or a preference with respect to dividend payments that could limit our ability to pay dividends to the holders of OMH's common stock. Thus, holders of OMH's common stock bear the risk that our future offerings may reduce the market price of OMH's common stock and dilute their stockholdings in us.31Table of Contents The future issuance of additional common stock in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions or otherwise will dilute all other stockholdings.OMH may issue any or all of the shares of common stock authorized but unissued without any action or approval by OMH's stockholders, subject to certain exceptions. OMH also intends to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and may issue common stock in connection with any such acquisition. Any common stock issued in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions, the exercise of outstanding stock options or otherwise would dilute the percentage ownership held by existing OMH's stockholders.GENERAL RISKSWe are a party to various lawsuits and proceedings and may become a party to various lawsuits and proceedings in the future which, if resolved in a manner adverse to us, could have a material adverse effect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.In the normal course of business, we have been named, and may be named in the future, as a defendant in various legal actions, including governmental investigations, examinations or other proceedings, arising in connection with our business activities. Certain of the legal actions may include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. Some of these proceedings are pending in jurisdictions that permit damage awards disproportionate to the actual economic damages allegedly incurred. A large judgment that is adverse to us could cause our reputation to suffer, encourage additional lawsuits against us and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. For additional information regarding pending legal proceedings and other contingencies, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.Certain operations rely on external vendors.We rely on third-party vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations, including a portion of our information systems, communication, data management and transaction processing. Accordingly, we are exposed to the risk that these vendors might not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements or service level agreements. Such failure to perform could be disruptive to our operations and have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These third parties are also sources of risk associated with operational errors, system interruptions or breaches and unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If our vendors encounter any of these issues, we could be exposed to disruption of service, damage to our reputation and litigation. If we lose the services of any of our key management personnel, our business could suffer.Our future success significantly depends on the continued service and performance of our key management personnel. Our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. Competition for these employees is intense and we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel. If we are unable to attract or retain appropriately qualified personnel, we may not be successful in originating loans and servicing our customers, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Employee misconduct could harm us by subjecting us to monetary loss, significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm.There is a risk that our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. For example, if an employee were to engage—or be accused of engaging—in illegal or suspicious activities including fraud or theft, we could suffer direct losses from such activity, and as a result, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial condition, customer relationships, and ability to attract future customers or employees. Regulators may allege or determine, based upon such misconduct, that our systems and procedures to detect and deter employee misconduct are inadequate. Misconduct by our employees, or even unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct, could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business.32Table of Contents"
10,OMF,ONEMAIN HOLDINGS INC,2022-02-11,"Risk Factors
.We face a variety of risks that are inherent in our business. In addition to the factors discussed in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC that could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, and results of operations, new risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our business or financial performance. Therefore, the risk factors below should not be considered a complete list of potential risks that we may face.Any risk factor described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any of our other SEC filings could by itself, or together with other factors, materially adversely affect our liquidity, competitive position, business, reputation, results of operations, or financial condition, including by materially increasing our expenses or decreasing our revenues, which could result in material losses.RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSOur financial condition and results of operations and our borrowers’ ability to make payments on their loans have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by economic conditions and other factors that we cannot control.Uncertainty and deterioration in general economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad historically have created a difficult operating environment for consumer lending. Many factors, including factors that are beyond our control, may impact our financial condition or results of operations and/or affect our borrowers’ willingness or capacity to make payments on their loans. These factors include: unemployment levels, housing markets, energy costs, and interest rates; events such as natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, or catastrophes; events that affect our borrowers, such as major medical expenses, divorce, or death; and the quality of any collateral underlying our finance receivables. If we experience a future economic downturn, or if we become affected by other events beyond our control, we may experience increased credit risks, significant reductions in revenues, earnings and cash flows, difficulties accessing capital, and a deterioration in the value of our investments.Moreover, our customers are primarily nonprime borrowers, who have historically been more likely to be affected, or more severely affected, by adverse macroeconomic conditions than prime borrowers. If a borrower defaults on a finance receivable held directly by us, we will bear a risk of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral, if any, and the outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest on the finance receivable, which could adversely affect our cash flows from operations. The cost to service our loans may also increase without a corresponding increase in our finance charge income.We also are exposed to geographic customer concentration risk. An economic downturn or catastrophic event that disproportionately affects certain geographic regions could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including the performance of our finance receivables portfolio. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for quantification of our largest concentrations of net finance receivables.We cannot give assurance that our policies and procedures for underwriting, processing, and servicing personal loans or credit cards will adequately adapt to adverse economic or other changes. If we fail to adapt to changing economic conditions or other factors, or if such changes adversely affect our borrowers’ willingness or capacity to repay their loans, our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity would be materially adversely affected.The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to adversely affect consumer finance businesses including OneMain. The virus causing COVID-19 was identified in late 2019 and was declared a global pandemic in March 2020. Governmental authorities have taken a number of steps to combat or slow the spread of COVID-19, including shutdowns of non-essential businesses, stay-at-home orders, social distancing measures, vaccine mandates, and other actions that disrupted economic activity. Certain states are experiencing new outbreaks of COVID-19 and have re-imposed restrictions on restaurants, entertainment, and similar venues. Efforts to combat the virus have been complicated by viral variants and uneven global access to and acceptance of vaccines. These measures have and may continue to impact all or portions of the Company’s workforce and our current and prospective customers. Although certain restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic have eased, uncertainty continues to exist regarding such measures and potential future measures. 19Table of Contents In response to COVID-19, we have modified our business practices with a portion of our employees working remotely to minimize interruptions in our business. Although these changes have allowed us to continue operations safely, the technology in home environments may not be as robust as in our offices and could cause networks, information systems, applications, and other tools available to employees to be more limited or less reliable than in our offices. The continuation of these work-from-home measures also introduces additional operational risk, including increased cybersecurity risk from phishing, malware, and other cybersecurity attacks, all of which could expose us to risks of data or financial loss and could seriously disrupt our operations and the operations of any impacted customers. If key personnel or a significant number of employees were to become unavailable due to the effects and restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic, including impacts of new variants, we could also be adversely affected. Additionally, we rely upon our third-party vendors to help us conduct aspects of our business and to process, record, and monitor transactions. If any of these vendors are unable to continue to provide us with their services, it could also negatively impact our ability to serve our customers. Although we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, there is no assurance that such plans and safeguards will be effective.Legal and regulatory responses to concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic could result in additional regulation or restrictions affecting the conduct of our business in the future. All of the foregoing may adversely affect our income and other results of operations, make collection of our finance receivables more difficult, or reduce income received from such receivables or our ability to obtain financing with respect to such receivables.The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. Volatility stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively affect our net interest income, lending activities, and profitability. Likewise, market volatility, as well as general economic, market, or social conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, could reduce the market price of shares of our common stock regardless of our operating performance.Additionally, to the extent that the pandemic harms our business and results of operations, many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors
” section may be heightened.There are risks associated with the acquisition or sale of assets or businesses and the formation, termination, or operation of joint ventures or other strategic alliances, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.We have previously acquired, and in the future may acquire, assets or businesses, either through the direct purchase of such assets or the purchase of a company’s equity. Since we will not have originated or serviced the finance receivables we acquire, we may not be aware of legal or other deficiencies related to origination or servicing, and our review of the portfolio prior to purchase may not uncover those deficiencies. Further, we may have limited recourse against the seller of the receivables.Potential difficulties we may encounter in connection with these transactions and arrangements include: the integration of the assets or business into our information technology platforms and servicing systems; the quality of servicing; disruption of our ongoing businesses and distraction of our management teams; incomplete or inaccurate records; inability to retain existing customers; unanticipated expenses; and potential unknown liabilities associated with the transactions, including legal liability related to origination and servicing prior to the acquisition.The anticipated benefits and synergies of any future acquisition will assume a successful integration, and will be based on projections and other assumptions, which are inherently uncertain. Even if integration is successful, anticipated benefits and synergies may not be achieved.If our estimates of allowance for finance receivable losses are not adequate to absorb actual losses, our provision for finance receivable losses would increase, which could adversely affect our results of operations.We maintain an allowance for finance receivable losses, which is a critical accounting estimate and requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions to determine the appropriate level of allowance. To estimate the appropriate level of allowance for finance receivable losses, we consider known and relevant internal and external factors that affect finance receivable collectability, including the total amount of finance receivables outstanding, historical finance receivable charge-offs, our current collection patterns, and current and forecasted economic trends. Our methodology for establishing our allowance for finance receivable losses is based on the guidance from Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, which requires us to measure expected credit losses for financial assets at each reporting date. The allowance is primarily based on historical experience, current conditions, and our reasonable and supportable forecast 20Table of Contents of economic conditions. If customer behavior changes as a result of economic conditions and if we are unable to accurately predict how the unemployment rates, and general economic conditions may affect our allowance for finance receivable losses, our allowance for finance receivable losses may be inadequate. Our allowance for finance receivable losses is an estimate, and if actual finance receivable losses are materially greater than our allowance for finance receivable losses, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Neither state regulators nor federal regulators oversee our allowance for finance receivable losses.Our valuations may include methodologies, models, estimations, and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to financial assets and liabilities that may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We use estimates, assumptions, and judgments when certain financial assets and liabilities are measured and reported at fair value. Fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on quoted market prices and/or other observable inputs provided by independent third-party sources, when available. During periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain assets if trading becomes less frequent or market data becomes less observable. In such cases, certain asset valuations may require significant judgment, and may include inputs and assumptions that require greater estimation, including credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and other relevant inputs. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.Our risk management efforts may not be effective.We could incur substantial losses and our business operations could be disrupted if we are unable to effectively identify, manage, monitor, and mitigate financial risks, such as credit risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk, liquidity risk, and other market-related risks, as well as operational risks related to our business, assets, and liabilities. To the extent our models used to assess the creditworthiness of potential borrowers do not adequately identify potential risks, the valuations produced will not adequately represent the risk profile of the borrowers and could result in a riskier finance receivables profile than originally identified. Our risk management policies, procedures, and techniques, including our scoring technology, may not be sufficient to identify all of the risks we are exposed to, mitigate the risks we have identified, or identify concentrations of risk or additional risks to which we may become subject in the future. We also face evolving risks as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the significant increase in our remote workforce and digital operations. These risks may not be adequately captured by our existing risk management framework.Changes in market conditions, including rising interest rates, could adversely affect the rate at which our borrowers prepay their loans and the value of our finance receivables portfolio, as well as increase our financing cost, which could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.Changing market conditions, the availability of credit, the relative economic vitality of the area in which borrowers and their assets are located, changes in tax laws, other opportunities for investment available to our customers, homeowner mobility, and other economic, social, geographic, demographic, and legal factors beyond our control, may affect the rates at which our borrowers prepay their loans. Generally, in situations where prepayment rates have slowed, the weighted-average life of our finance receivables has increased. Any increase in interest rates may further slow the rate of prepayment for our finance receivables, which could adversely affect our liquidity by reducing the cash flows from, and the value of, the finance receivables we hold for sale or utilize as collateral in our secured funding transactions.Moreover, our finance receivables are fixed-rate and generally decline in value if interest rates increase. As such, if changing market conditions cause interest rates to increase substantially, the value of our finance receivables could decline. Some jurisdictions limit the maximum interest rate that we may charge on a certain population of our loans so we have limited ability to increase the interest rate on our loans made in those jurisdictions. Our yield, as well as our cash flows from operations and results of operations, could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to increase the interest rates charged on new loans to offset any increases in our cost of funds. Accordingly, any increase in interest rates could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.21Table of Contents We may be required to indemnify or repurchase finance receivables from purchasers of finance receivables that we have sold or securitized, or which we will sell or securitize in the future, if our finance receivables fail to meet certain criteria or characteristics or under other circumstances, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.The documents governing our finance receivable sales and securitizations contain provisions that require us to indemnify the purchasers of securitized finance receivables, or to repurchase the affected finance receivables, under certain circumstances. While our sale and securitization documents vary, they generally contain customary provisions that may require us to repurchase finance receivables if:•our representations and warranties concerning the quality and characteristics of the finance receivable are inaccurate;•there is borrower fraud; or•we fail to comply, at the individual finance receivable level or otherwise, with regulatory requirements in connection with the origination and servicing of the finance receivables.At its maximum, our exposure to repurchases or our indemnification obligations under our representations and warranties could include the current unpaid balance of all finance receivables that we have sold or securitized, and which are not subject to settlement agreements with purchasers.The risk of loss on the finance receivables that we have securitized is recognized in our allowance for finance receivable losses since all of our loan securitizations are recorded on our balance sheet. If we are required to indemnify purchasers or repurchase finance receivables that we sell or have sold and such indemnification or repurchase results in losses or recognition of losses on securitized finance receivables that exceed our recorded allowance for finance receivable losses associated with our securitizations, this could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.Our business and reputation may be materially impacted by information system failures, cyber-attacks, or network disruptions.Our business relies heavily on information systems to deliver products and services to our customers, and to manage our operations. These systems may encounter service disruptions due to system, network or software failure, security breaches, cyber-attacks, ransomware, computer viruses, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events, disruptions, or intrusions. In addition, denial-of-service attacks could overwhelm our internet sites and prevent us from adequately serving customers. Cyber-attacks, including ransomware, are constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. We also may face new or heightened risk due to the increase in our remote workforce and digital operations. We may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities, which may allow them to persist in our system environment over long periods of time. Cyber-attacks can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our computer systems and networks and those of our third-party vendors. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and our business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient to adequately address the disruption. A disruption could impair our ability to offer and process our loans, provide customer service, perform collections or other necessary business activities, which could result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. There may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personally identifiable information (PII), that could subject us to significant reputational, financial, legal, and operational consequences.Our operations rely heavily on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential customer and other information including, among other things, PII, in our computer systems and networks, as well as those of third parties. Our branch locations and centralized servicing centers, as well as our administrative and executive offices, are part of an electronic information network that is designed to permit us to originate and track finance receivables and collections and perform other tasks that are part of our everyday operations. Additionally, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the significant increase in our remote workforce and digital operations, our vulnerability to unauthorized access to confidential information may increase. We devote significant resources to network and data security, including using encryption, access controls, authentication, and other security measures intended to protect our computer systems and data. These security measures may not be sufficient and may be vulnerable to hacking, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management, or other irregularities. For example, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing usernames, passwords, or 22Table of Contents other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our computer systems. Any failure, interruption, or breach in our cybersecurity could result in reputational harm, disruption of our customer relationships, or our inability to originate, process and service our finance receivable products, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Further, any of these cybersecurity and operational risks could expose us to lawsuits by customers for identity theft or other damages resulting from data breach involving PII or misuse of their PII and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. In addition, regulators may impose penalties and/or require remedial action if they identify weaknesses in our security systems, and we may be required to incur significant costs to increase our cybersecurity to address any vulnerabilities that may be discovered or to remediate the harm caused by any security breaches. As part of our business, we may share confidential customer information and proprietary information with customers, vendors, service providers, and business partners. The information systems of these third parties may be vulnerable to security breaches and, despite our best efforts, we may not be able to ensure that these third parties have appropriate security controls in place to protect the information we share with them. If our confidential information is intercepted, stolen, misused, or mishandled while in possession of a third-party, it could result in reputational harm to us, loss of customer business, and additional regulatory scrutiny, and it could expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Although we have insurance that is intended to cover certain losses from such events, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate or available.We are also subject to the theft or misuse of physical customer and employee records at our facilities.Our branch locations and centralized servicing centers have physical customer records necessary for day-to-day operations that contain confidential information about our customers. We also retain physical records in various storage locations. The loss or theft of customer information from our branch locations, central servicing facilities, or other storage locations could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and penalties and could expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. In addition, if we cannot locate original documents (or copies, in some cases) for certain finance receivables, we may not be able to collect on those finance receivables.Our insurance operations are subject to risks and uncertainties, including claims, catastrophic events, underwriting risks, and dependence on a primary distribution channel.Insurance claims and policyholder liabilities are difficult to predict and may exceed the related reserves set aside for claims (losses) and associated expenses for claims adjudication (loss adjustment expenses). Additionally, events such as natural disasters, pandemic disease, cyber security breaches and other types of catastrophes, and prolonged economic downturns, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Other risks relating to our insurance operations include changes to laws and regulations applicable to us, as well as changes to the regulatory environment, such as: changes to laws or regulations affecting capital and reserve requirements; frequency and type of regulatory monitoring and reporting; consumer privacy, use of customer data and data security; benefits or loss ratio requirements; insurance producer licensing or appointment requirements; required disclosures to consumers; and collateral protection insurance (i.e., insurance some of our lender companies purchase, at the customer’s expense, on that customer’s loan collateral for the periods of time the customer fails to adequately, as required by the customer's loan, insure the collateral). Because our customers do not directly agree to the amount charged for collateral protection at the time it is purchased, regulators may in the future prohibit our insurance companies from providing this insurance to our lending operations. Moreover, our insurance companies are predominately dependent on our lending operations as the primary source of business and product distribution. If our lending operations discontinue offering insurance products, our insurance operations would need to find an alternate distribution partner for their products, of which there can be no assurance.Our use of derivatives exposes us to credit and market risks.From time to time, we may enter into derivative financial instruments for economic hedging purposes, such as managing our exposure to interest rate risk. By using derivative instruments, we are exposed to credit and market risks, including the risk of loss associated with variations in the spread between the asset yield and the funding and/or hedge cost, default risk, and the risk of insolvency or other inability of the counterparty to a particular derivative financial instrument to perform its obligations.23Table of Contents We may not be able to make technological improvements as quickly as some of our competitors, which could harm our ability to compete and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial and lending institutions to better serve customers and reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services as quickly as some of our competitors or be successful in marketing these products and services to our existing and new customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could harm our ability to compete and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.If goodwill and other intangible assets become impaired, it could have a negative impact on our profitability.Goodwill represents the amount of acquisition cost over the fair value of net assets we acquired. If the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Any such adjustments are reflected in our results of operations in the periods in which the impairments become known. There can be no assurance that our future evaluations of goodwill and other intangible assets will not result in findings of impairments and related write-downs, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for further information on goodwill and intangible asset impairment.Damage to our reputation could adversely impact our business and financial results.Our ability to attract and retain customers and employees is significantly impacted by our reputation. Damage to our reputation can arise as a result of our actions or those of our employees or as a result of negative public opinion about the financial services industry. Negative public opinion may relate to any aspect of or risk associated with our business, including but not limited to, our lending practices, cybersecurity breaches, failures to safeguard personal information, discriminating or harassing behavior of employees, compensation practices, sales practices, environmental, social, and governance practices and disclosures, or failure or perceived failure to comply with laws or regulations. Negative publicity directed at us could generate dissatisfaction among our customers and employees. We cannot give assurance that our policies and procedures will be fully effective in preventing conduct that could damage our reputation. Furthermore, our actual or perceived failure to address or prevent any such conduct or otherwise to effectively manage our business or operations could result in significant reputational harm.RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY AND REGULATIONWe operate in a highly competitive market, and we cannot ensure that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.The consumer finance industry is highly competitive. Our profitability depends, in large part, on our ability to underwrite and originate finance receivables. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than we possess. Some competitors may also have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that may not be available to us. We cannot give assurance that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.Our businesses are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business and failure to comply with such regulations may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.Our businesses are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations, and various state authorities regulate and supervise our lending business and insurance operations.We also must comply with extensive regulations in servicing our legacy real estate loans and loan portfolios for other parties and will have to comply with these servicing regulations if we acquire loan portfolios in the future for which we act as a servicer.Our operations are subject to regular examination by state regulators and, for certain aspects of our business, by U.S. federal and foreign regulators. Our entities are subject to several hundred regulatory examinations in a given year. These examinations 24Table of Contents may require us to change our policies or practices, pay monetary fines, or make reimbursements to customers. Many state regulators and some federal regulators have indicated an intention to pool their resources to conduct examinations of licensed entities, including us, at the same time (referred to as a “multi-state” examination). This could result in more in-depth examinations, which could be costlier and lead to more significant enforcement actions.We are also subject to potential enforcement, supervisions, and other actions that may be brought by state attorneys general or other state enforcement authorities and other governmental agencies. Such actions could subject us to civil money penalties, customer remediation, and increased compliance costs, as well as damage our reputation and brand and could limit or prohibit our ability to offer certain products and services or engage in certain business practices.State attorneys general have a variety of tools at their disposal to enforce state and federal consumer financial laws. First, Section 1042 of the Dodd-Frank Act grants state attorneys general the ability to enforce the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act’s authority and to secure remedies provided in the Act against entities within their jurisdiction. State attorneys general also have enforcement authority under state law with respect to unfair or deceptive practices. Generally, under these statutes, state attorneys general may conduct investigations, bring actions, and recover civil penalties or obtain injunctive relief against entities engaging in unfair, deceptive, or fraudulent acts. Attorneys general may also coordinate among themselves to enter into multi-state actions or settlements. Several consumer financial laws like the Truth in Lending Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act grant enforcement or litigation authority to state attorneys general.We are subject to potential changes in federal and state law, which could lower the interest-rate limit that non-depository financial institutions may charge for consumer loans or could expand the definition of interest under federal and state law to include the cost of optional products, such as insurance. Such changes could limit our interest income, insurance revenues, and other revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We may not be able to maintain all requisite licenses and permits, and the failure to satisfy those or other regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, changes in laws or regulations applicable to us could subject us to additional licensing, registration and other regulatory requirements in the future or could adversely affect our ability to operate or the way we conduct business.A material failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in regulatory actions, including substantial fines or penalties, lawsuits, and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.For more information with respect to the regulatory framework affecting our businesses, see “Business—Regulation” included in this report.Requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and oversight by the CFPB significantly increase our regulatory costs and burdens.The Dodd-Frank Act and the related regulations increased oversight of financial services and products by the CFPB, and imposed restrictions on the allowable terms for certain consumer credit transactions. The CFPB has significant authority to implement and enforce federal consumer finance laws, including the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act and new requirements for financial services products provided for in the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the authority to identify and prohibit unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provides the CFPB with broad supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over various consumer financial products and services, including the ability to require reimbursements and other payments to customers for alleged legal violations, and to impose significant penalties, as well as injunctive relief that prohibits lenders from engaging in allegedly unlawful practices. Further, state attorneys general and state regulators are authorized to bring civil actions to enforce certain consumer protection provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The industry investigation and enforcement provisions of Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act may adversely affect our business if the CFPB or one or more state attorneys general or state regulators believe that we have violated any federal consumer financial protection laws, including the prohibition in Title X against unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices.The CFPB currently has supervisory authority over our real estate servicing activities, and may in the future have supervisory authority over other parts of our consumer lending business. It also has the authority to bring enforcement actions for violations of laws over which it has jurisdiction regardless of whether it has supervisory authority for a given product or service. The Dodd-Frank Act also gives the CFPB supervisory authority over entities that are designated as “larger participants” in certain financial services markets. The CFPB has published regulations for “larger participants” in the market of auto finance, and we have been designated as a larger participant in this market. The larger-participant rule for consumer installment loans was one 25Table of Contents of the rulemaking initiatives the CFPB designated as inactive in its Spring 2018 rulemaking agenda. It is not known if or when the CFPB may consider reactivating the rulemaking process for the larger participant rule for consumer installment loans. The CFPB’s broad supervisory and enforcement powers could affect our business and operations significantly in terms of increased operating and regulatory compliance costs, and limits on the types of products we offer and the way they are offered, among other things.The CFPB and certain state regulators have acted against some lenders regarding, for instance, debt collection and the marketing of optional products offered by the lenders in connection with their loans. The products included debt cancellation/suspension products and other types of payment protection insurance. We collect on delinquent debt. We also sell optional insurance and non-insurance products in connection with our loans. Our debt collection practices and sales of optional insurance and non-insurance products could be challenged in a similar manner by the CFPB or state consumer lending regulators.Some of the rulemaking under the Dodd-Frank Act remains pending. As a result, the complete impact of the Dodd-Frank Act remains uncertain. It is not clear what form remaining regulations will ultimately take, or how our business will be affected.For more information with respect to the regulatory framework affecting our businesses and the CFPB, see “Business—Regulation” included in this report.Current and proposed regulations relating to consumer privacy, data protection, and information security could increase our costs.We are subject to federal and state consumer privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations. For example, we are subject to the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the New York Cybersecurity Regulation, which govern the use of PII by financial institutions and require certain safeguards for protecting PII. Moreover, various state laws and regulations may require us to notify customers, employees, state attorneys general, regulators, and others in the event of a security breach. Federal and state legislators and regulators are pursuing new guidance, laws, and regulations relating to consumer privacy, data protection, and information security. Compliance with current or future consumer privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations could result in higher compliance, technology, or other operating costs. Any violations of these laws and regulations may require us to change our business practices or operational structure. Violations could subject us to material legal claims, monetary penalties, sanctions, and obligations to compensate and/or notify customers, employees, state attorneys general, regulators, and others, or take other remedial actions.Our use of third-party vendors is subject to regulatory review.The CFPB and other regulators have issued regulatory guidance focusing on the need for financial institutions to perform due diligence and ongoing monitoring of third-party vendor relationships, which increases the scope of management involvement and decreases the benefit that we receive from using third-party vendors. Moreover, if our regulators conclude that we have not met the standards for oversight of our third-party vendors, we could be subject to enforcement actions, civil monetary penalties, supervisory orders to cease and desist, or other remedial actions, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, federal and state regulators have scrutinized the practices of lead aggregators and providers.  If regulators place restrictions on certain practices by lead aggregators or providers, our ability to use them as a source for applicants could be affected.We purchase and sell finance receivables, including charged-off receivables and receivables where the borrower is in default. This practice could subject us to heightened regulatory scrutiny, which may expose us to legal action, cause us to incur losses and/or limit or impede our collection activity.As part of our business, we purchase and sell finance receivables. Some of these finance receivables may be in default (including in bankruptcy) or the debt may have been charged off as uncollectible. The CFPB and other regulators have significantly increased their scrutiny of the purchase and sale of debt, and collections practices undertaken by purchasers of debt, especially delinquent and charged-off debt. The CFPB has scrutinized sellers of debt for not maintaining sufficient documentation to support and verify the validity or amount of the debt. It has also scrutinized debt collectors for, among other things, their collection tactics, attempting to collect debts that no longer are valid, misrepresenting the amount of the debt and not having sufficient documentation to verify the validity or amount of the debt. Our purchases or sales of receivables could expose us to lawsuits or fines by regulators if we do not have sufficient documentation to support and verify the validity and amount of the finance receivables underlying these transactions, or if we or purchasers of our finance receivables use collection methods that are viewed as unfair or abusive. In addition, our collections could suffer, and we may incur additional expenses if 26Table of Contents we are required to change collection practices or stop collecting on certain debts because of a lawsuit or action on the part of regulators.Changes in law and regulatory developments could result in significant additional compliance costs relating to securitizations.The Dodd-Frank Act requires, among other things, that a securitizer retain at least a 5% economic interest in the credit risk of the securitized assets; this requirement has reduced and will continue to reduce the amount of financing obtained from such transactions. Furthermore, sponsors are prohibited from diluting the required risk retention by dividing the economic interest among multiple parties or hedging or transferring the credit risk the sponsor is required to maintain.Rules relating to securitizations rated by nationally-recognized statistical rating agencies require that the findings of any third-party due diligence service providers be made publicly available at least five business days prior to the first sale of securities, which has led and will continue to lead us to incur additional costs in connection with each securitization.We may have to constrain our business activities to avoid being deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act.The Investment Company Act regulates the manner in which “investment companies” are permitted to conduct their business activities. We believe we have conducted, and intend to continue to conduct, our business in a manner that does not result in the Company being characterized as an investment company, including relying on certain exemptions from registration as an investment company. We rely on guidance published by the SEC staff or on our analyses of such guidance to determine our qualification under these and other exemptions. To the extent that the SEC staff publishes new or different guidance with respect to these matters, we may be required to adjust our business operations accordingly. Any additional guidance from the SEC staff could provide additional flexibility to us, or it could inhibit our ability to conduct our business operations. We cannot give assurance that the laws and regulations governing our Investment Company Act status or SEC guidance regarding the Investment Company Act will not change in a manner that adversely affects our operations. If we are deemed to be an investment company, we may attempt to seek exemptive relief from the SEC, which could impose significant costs on us. We may not receive such relief on a timely basis, if at all, and such relief may require us to modify or curtail our operations. If we are deemed to be an investment company, we may also be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted.RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESSAn inability to access adequate sources of liquidity may adversely affect our ability to fund operational requirements and satisfy financial obligations.Our ability to access capital and credit may be significantly affected by disruption in the U.S. credit markets and the associated credit rating downgrades on our debt. In addition, the risk of volatility surrounding the global economic system and uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic continue to create significant volatility in, and uncertainty around access to, the capital markets. Historically, we have funded our operations and repaid our debt and other obligations using funds collected from our finance receivable portfolio and new debt issuances. Our current corporate credit ratings are below investment grade and, as a result, our borrowing costs may further increase and our ability to borrow may be limited. In addition to issuing unsecured debt in the public and private markets, we have raised capital through securitization transactions and, although there can be no assurances that we will be able to complete additional securitizations or issue additional unsecured debt, we currently expect our near-term sources of capital markets funding to continue to derive from securitization transactions and unsecured debt offerings.Any future capital markets transactions will be dependent on our financial performance as well as market conditions, which may result in receiving financing on terms less favorable to us than our existing financings. In addition, our access to future financing and our ability to refinance existing debt will depend on a variety of factors such as our financial performance, the general availability of credit, our credit ratings and credit capacity at the time we pursue such financing.If we are unable to complete additional securitization transactions or unsecured debt offerings on a timely basis or upon terms acceptable to us or otherwise access adequate sources of liquidity, our ability to fund our own operational requirements and satisfy financial obligations may be adversely affected.27Table of Contents Our indebtedness is significant, which could affect our ability to meet our obligations under our debt instruments and could materially and adversely affect our business and ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry.Our significant indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:•it may require us to dedicate a larger portion of our cash flows from operations to pay our indebtedness, which reduces the funds available for other purposes, including finance receivable originations and capital returns;•it may limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing regulatory, business, and economic conditions;•it may limit our ability to incur additional borrowings or securitizations;•it may require us to seek to change the maturity, interest rate and other terms of our existing debt;•it may place us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors that are not as highly leveraged;•it may cause a downgrade of our debt and long-term corporate ratings; and•it may cause us to be more vulnerable to periods of negative or slow growth in the general economy or in our business.In addition, meeting our anticipated liquidity requirements is contingent upon our continued compliance with our existing debt agreements. An event of default or declaration of acceleration under one of our existing debt agreements could also result in an event of default and declaration of acceleration under certain of our other existing debt agreements. Such an acceleration of our debt would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to continue as a going concern. If our debt obligations increase, whether due to the increased cost of existing indebtedness or the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the consequences described above could be magnified. There can be no assurance that we will be able to repay or refinance our debt in the future.Certain of our outstanding notes contain covenants that restrict our operations and may inhibit our ability to grow our business and increase revenues.OMFC’s indenture and certain of OMFC’s notes contain a covenant that limits OMFC’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to create or incur liens. The restrictions may interfere with our ability to obtain additional financing or affect the way we structure such financing or engage in other business activities. A default and resulting acceleration of obligations could also result in an event of default and declaration of acceleration under certain of our other existing debt agreements. Such an acceleration of our debt would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to continue as a going concern. A default could also significantly limit our alternatives to refinance our indebtedness. This limitation may significantly restrict our financing options during times of either market distress or our financial distress, which are precisely the times when having financing options is most important.The assessment of our liquidity is based upon significant judgments and estimates that could prove to be materially incorrect.In assessing our current financial position and developing operating plans, management has made significant judgments and estimates with respect to our liquidity, including but not limited to:•our ability to generate sufficient cash to service all of our outstanding debt;•our continued ability to access debt and securitization markets and other sources of funding on favorable terms;•our ability to complete on favorable terms, as needed, additional borrowings, securitizations, finance receivable portfolio sales, or other transactions to support liquidity, and the costs associated with these funding sources, including sales at less than carrying value and limits on the types of assets that can be securitized or sold, which would affect our profitability;•the potential for downgrade of our debt by rating agencies, which would have a negative impact on our cost of, and access to, capital;•our ability to comply with our debt covenants;•our ability to make capital returns to OMH's stockholders;•the amount of cash expected to be received from our finance receivable portfolio through collections (including prepayments) and receipt of finance charges;•the potential for declining financial flexibility and reduced income should we use more of our assets for securitizations and finance receivable portfolio sales; and•the potential for reduced income due to the possible deterioration of the credit quality of our finance receivable portfolios.28Table of Contents Additionally, there are numerous risks to our financial results, liquidity, and capital raising and debt refinancing plans that are not quantified in our current liquidity forecasts. These risks include, but are not limited, to the following:•our inability to grow our personal loan portfolio with adequate profitability to fund operations, loan losses, and other expenses;•our inability to monetize assets including, but not limited to, our access to debt and securitization markets;•our inability to obtain the additional necessary funding to finance our operations;•the effect of current and potential new federal, state, and local laws, regulations, or regulatory policies and practices on our ability to conduct business or the way we conduct business, as well as changes that may result from increased regulatory scrutiny of the sub-prime lending industry;•potential liability relating to real estate and personal loans which we have sold or may sell in the future, or relating to securitized loans, if it is determined that there was a non-curable breach of a warranty made in connection with the transaction;•the potential for increasing costs and difficulty in servicing our loan portfolio because of heightened regulatory scrutiny of loan servicing and foreclosure practices in the industry generally;•the potential for additional unforeseen cash demands or acceleration of obligations;•reduced income due to loan modifications where the borrower’s interest rate is reduced, principal payments are deferred, or other concessions are made;•the potential for declines or volatility in bond and equity markets; and•the potential effect on us if the capital levels of our regulated and unregulated subsidiaries prove inadequate to support our business plans.The actual outcome of one or more of our plans could be materially different than expected or one or more of our significant judgments or estimates about the potential effects of these risks and uncertainties could prove to be materially incorrect. In the event of such an occurrence, if third-party financing is not available, our liquidity could be materially adversely affected, and as a result, substantial doubt could exist about our ability to continue as a going concern.OMFC's credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to raise capital in the debt markets at attractive rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.S&P, Moody’s, and KBRA rate OMFC’s debt. Ratings reflect the rating agencies’ opinions of a company’s financial strength, operating performance, strategic position, and ability to meet its obligations. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating. If OMFC’s current ratings are downgraded, it will likely increase the interest rate that we would have to pay to raise money in the capital markets, making it more expensive for us to borrow money and adversely impacting our access to capital. As a result, a downgrade of OMFC's ratings could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.Our securitizations may expose us to financing and other risks, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to access the securitization market in the future, which may require us to seek more costly financing.We cannot give assurance that we will be able to complete additional securitizations if the securitization markets become constrained. In addition, the value of any subordinated securities that we may retain in our securitizations might be reduced or, in some cases, eliminated because of adverse changes in economic conditions or the financial markets.OMFC, OMFG, and OMFH currently act as the servicers with respect to the personal loan securitization trusts and related series of asset-backed securities. If OMFC, OMFG, or OMFH defaults in its servicing obligations, an early amortization event could occur with respect to the relevant asset-backed securities and OMFC, OMFG, or OMFH, as applicable, could be replaced as servicer. Servicer defaults include, for example, the failure of the servicer to make any payment, transfer or deposit in accordance with the securitization documents, a breach of representations, warranties or agreements made by the servicer under the securitization documents and the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the servicer. Such an early amortization event could damage our reputation and have materially adverse consequences on our liquidity and cost of funds.Rating agencies may also affect our ability to execute a securitization transaction or increase the costs we expect to incur from executing securitization transactions. Rating agencies could alter their ratings processes or criteria after we have accumulated finance receivables for securitization in a manner that effectively reduces the value of those finance receivables by increasing 29Table of Contents our financing costs or otherwise requiring that we incur additional costs to comply with those processes and criteria. We cannot control or predict what actions the rating agencies may take in this regard.Further, other matters, such as (i) accounting standards applicable to securitization transactions and (ii) capital and leverage requirements applicable to banks and other regulated financial institutions' asset-backed securities, could result in decreased investor demand for securities issued through our securitization transactions, or increased competition from other institutions that undertake securitization transactions. In addition, compliance with certain regulatory requirements, including the Dodd-Frank Act and the Investment Company Act, may affect the type of securitizations that we are able to complete.If it is not possible or economical for us to securitize our finance receivables in the future, we would need to seek alternative financing to support our operations and to meet our existing debt obligations, which may be less efficient and more expensive than raising capital via securitizations and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.RISKS RELATED TO OUR ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTUREOMH and OMFC are holding companies with no operations and rely on our operating subsidiaries to provide us with funds necessary to meet our financial obligations and enable us to pay dividends.Our principal assets are the equity interests we directly or indirectly hold in our operating subsidiaries, which own our operating assets. As a result, we are dependent on loans, dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries for funds to meet our financial obligations and enable OMH to pay dividends on its common stock. Our subsidiaries are legally distinct from us, and certain of our subsidiaries are prohibited or restricted from paying dividends or otherwise making funds available to us under certain conditions. For example, our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit their ability to pay dividends or make loans or advances to us, principally to protect policyholders, and certain of OMFC's debt agreements limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. If we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries, or if our subsidiaries do not generate sufficient cash from operations, we may be unable to meet our financial obligations or pay dividends, and the board may exercise its discretion not to pay dividends.OMH may not pay dividends on its common stock in the future, even if liquidity and leverage targets are met.While OMH intends to pay its minimum quarterly dividends, currently $0.95 per share, for the foreseeable future, all subsequent dividends will be reviewed and declared at the discretion of the Board and will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, cash flows, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applicable to the payment of dividends, and other considerations that the Board deems relevant. As a result, we cannot give assurance that OMH will continue to pay dividends on its common stock in future periods, even if liquidity and target leverage objectives are met. See our “Dividend Policy” in Part II - Item 5 of this report for further information on dividends. Certain provisions of our Stockholders Agreement, restated certificate of incorporation, and amended and restated bylaws could hinder, delay or prevent a change in control of OMH, which could adversely affect the price of OMH's common stock.The Stockholders Agreement, OMH's restated certificate of incorporation, and OMH’s amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of the Board. These provisions provide for:•a classified Board with staggered three-year terms;•certain rights with respect to the designation of directors for nomination and election to the board of directors, including the ability of Värde to appoint one director, for so long as Värde has beneficial ownership of less than 10% but at least 5% of the voting power of OMH;•removal of directors only for cause and only with the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the voting interest of stockholders entitled to vote;•no ability for stockholders to call special meetings of OMH's stockholders;•advance notice requirements by stockholders with respect to director nominations and actions to be taken at annual meetings;•the ability for stockholders to act outside a meeting by written consent only if unanimous; and30Table of Contents •the issuance of blank check preferred stock by the Board from time to time in one or more series and to establish the terms, preferences and rights of any such series of preferred stock, all without approval of OMH stockholders. Nothing in OMH's restated certificate of incorporation precludes future issuances without stockholder approval of the authorized but unissued shares of OMH's common stock.These anti-takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to benefit from a change in control or change our management and board of directors and, as a result, may adversely affect the market price of OMH's common stock and the ability of public stockholders to realize any potential change of control premium.See additional information under “Business Overview” in Item 1 of this report. The terms of the Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement are described in OMH's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 25, 2018, and such Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Licensing and insurance laws and regulations may delay or impede purchases of OMH's common stock.Certain of the states in which we are licensed to originate loans and the state in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled (Texas) have laws and regulations that require regulatory approval for the acquisition of “control” of regulated entities. In addition, Texas insurance laws and regulations generally provide that no person may acquire control, directly or indirectly, of a domiciled insurer, unless the person has provided the required information to, and the acquisition is subsequently approved or not disapproved by the Department of Insurance (“DOI”). Under state insurance laws or regulations, there exists a presumption of “control” when an acquiring party acquires as little as 10% of the voting securities of a regulated entity or of a company which itself controls (directly or indirectly) a regulated entity (the threshold is 10% under the insurance statute of Texas). Therefore, any person acquiring 10% or more of OMH's common stock may need the prior approval of the Texas insurance and/or licensing regulators, or a determination from such regulators that “control” has not been acquired, which could significantly delay or otherwise impede their ability to complete such purchase. RISKS RELATED TO OMH'S COMMON STOCKThe market price and trading volume of OMH's common stock may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for OMH's stockholders.The market price of OMH's common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations and may decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of OMH's common stock include: variations in our quarterly or annual operating results; changes in our earnings estimates (if provided) or differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts; additions to, or departures of, key management personnel; and any increased indebtedness we may incur in the future.These factors may decrease the market price of OMH's common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Volatility in the market price of a company’s securities may result in securities class action litigation. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.Future offerings of debt or equity securities by us may adversely affect the market price of OMH's common stock.In the future, we may attempt to obtain financing or to further increase our capital resources by issuing additional shares of OMH's common stock or offering debt or other equity securities, including debt securities convertible into equity or shares of preferred stock. Future acquisitions could require substantial additional capital in excess of cash from operations.Issuing additional shares of OMH's common stock or other equity securities or securities convertible into equity may dilute the economic and voting rights of OMH's stockholders at the time of such issuance or reduce the market price of OMH's common stock or both.  Upon liquidation, holders of debt securities and preferred shares, if issued, and lenders with respect to other borrowings would receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of OMH's common stock. Debt securities convertible into equity could be subject to adjustments in the conversion ratio pursuant to which certain events may increase the number of equity securities issuable upon conversion. Preferred shares, if issued, could have a preference with respect to liquidating distributions or a preference with respect to dividend payments that could limit our ability to pay dividends to the holders of OMH's common stock. Thus, holders of OMH's common stock bear the risk that our future offerings may reduce the market price of OMH's common stock and dilute their stockholdings in us.31Table of Contents The future issuance of additional common stock in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions or otherwise will dilute all other stockholdings.OMH had an aggregate of 1,872,540,640 shares of common stock authorized but unissued as of January 31, 2022. OMH may issue any or all of these shares of common stock without any action or approval by OMH's stockholders, subject to certain exceptions. OMH also intends to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and may issue common stock in connection with any such acquisition. Any common stock issued in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions, the exercise of outstanding stock options or otherwise would dilute the percentage ownership held by existing OMH's stockholders.GENERAL RISKSWe are a party to various lawsuits and proceedings and may become a party to various lawsuits and proceedings in the future which, if resolved in a manner adverse to us, could have a material adverse effect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.In the normal course of business, we have been named, and may be named in the future, as a defendant in various legal actions, including governmental investigations, examinations or other proceedings, arising in connection with our business activities. Certain of the legal actions may include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. Some of these proceedings are pending in jurisdictions that permit damage awards disproportionate to the actual economic damages allegedly incurred. A large judgment that is adverse to us could cause our reputation to suffer, encourage additional lawsuits against us and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. For additional information regarding pending legal proceedings and other contingencies, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.Certain operations rely on external vendors.We rely on third-party vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations, including a portion of our information systems, communication, data management and transaction processing. Accordingly, we are exposed to the risk that these vendors might not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements or service level agreements. Such failure to perform could be disruptive to our operations and have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These third parties are also sources of risk associated with operational errors, system interruptions or breaches and unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If our vendors encounter any of these issues, we could be exposed to disruption of service, damage to our reputation and litigation. If we lose the services of any of our key management personnel, our business could suffer.Our future success significantly depends on the continued service and performance of our key management personnel. Our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. Competition for these employees is intense and we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel. If we are unable to attract or retain appropriately qualified personnel, we may not be successful in originating loans and servicing our customers, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Employee misconduct could harm us by subjecting us to monetary loss, significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm.There is a risk that our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. For example, if an employee were to engage—or be accused of engaging—in illegal or suspicious activities including fraud or theft, we could suffer direct losses from such activity, and as a result, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial condition, customer relationships, and ability to attract future customers or employees. Regulators may allege or determine, based upon such misconduct, that our systems and procedures to detect and deter employee misconduct are inadequate. Misconduct by our employees, or even unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct, could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business.32Table of Contents"

pandemic is adversely affecting consumer finance businesses including OneMain. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in widespread volatility and deterioration in economic conditions across the United States. Governmental authorities have taken a number of steps to combat or slow the spread of COVID-19, including shutdowns of non-essential businesses, stay-at-home orders, social distancing measures, and other actions which have disrupted economic activity. Certain states are experiencing new outbreaks of COVID-19 and have re-imposed shutdowns of restaurants, entertainment, and similar venues. These disruptions and uncertainties related to shutdowns and reopenings have continued to result in a significant reduction in the number of customers at our branch locations and lowered demand for our products, which, combined with our credit tightening, has decreased our loan originations. COVID-19 has also resulted in higher unemployment in the United States, which over time may result in increased delinquencies and credit losses on finance receivables outstanding. As a result, we cannot foresee whether the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic will be effectively contained, nor can we predict the severity and duration of its impact.Recently, authorities have begun to distribute newly developed COVID-19 vaccines to health care workers and other priority groups, which over time are designed to create “herd immunity” and diminish, if not eliminate, the crisis. The success of the vaccination program will depend to a large extent on the willingness of Americans to receive vaccinations and the effectiveness of the distribution effort, both of which are uncertain at this time. Moreover, new strains of the virus are spreading in the U.S. and abroad, and it is uncertain how effective the vaccines will be against these new strains.We believe that many of our customers have benefited from the enhanced benefits provided by the CARES Act, some of which, such as enhanced unemployment benefits, were available from March 2020 through July 2020. We believe they will also benefit from the CAA. The CAA provides for another round of direct payments, enhanced unemployment benefits, education funding, and aid to sectors still reeling from the economic fallout of the pandemic. While these measures may benefit many of our customers, we cannot assure you that the implementation of these measures will offset the negative impact of COVID-19 on our customers. If the CAA or any additional stimulus measures are not sufficient to remediate the financial stress on our customers as a result of the pandemic, we may experience an increase in delinquencies that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods.Legal and regulatory responses to concerns about COVID-19 could result in additional regulation or restrictions affecting the conduct of our business in the future. All of the foregoing may adversely affect our income and other results of operations, make collection of our personal loans more difficult, or reduce income received from such loans or our ability to obtain financing with respect to such loans.Finally, to the extent that the pandemic harms our business and results of operations, many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors
” section may be heightened.Our results of operations and financial condition and our borrowers’ ability to make payments on their loans have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by economic conditions and other factors that we cannot control.Uncertainty and deterioration in general economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad historically have created a difficult operating environment for consumer lending. Many factors, including factors that are beyond our control, may impact our results of operations or financial condition and/or affect our borrowers’ willingness or capacity to make payments on their loans. These factors include: unemployment levels, housing markets, energy costs and interest rates; events such as natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, catastrophes; events that affect our borrowers, such as major medical expenses, divorce or death; and the quality of any collateral underlying our finance receivables. If we experience a future economic downturn, or if we become affected by other events beyond our control, we may experience increased credit risks, significant reductions in revenues, earnings and cash flows, difficulties accessing capital and a deterioration in the value of our investments.Moreover, our customers are primarily non-prime borrowers, who have historically been more likely to be affected, or more severely affected, by adverse macroeconomic conditions than prime borrowers. If a borrower defaults under a finance receivable held directly by us, we will bear a risk of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral, if any, and the outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest on the finance receivable, which could adversely affect our cash flows from operations. The cost to service our loans may also increase without a corresponding increase in our finance charge income.21Table of Contents We also are exposed to geographic customer concentration risk. An economic downturn or catastrophic event that disproportionately affects certain geographic regions could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, including the performance of our finance receivables portfolio. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for quantification of our largest concentrations of net finance receivables.We cannot assure you that our policies and procedures for underwriting, processing and servicing loans will adequately adapt to adverse economic or other changes. If we fail to adapt to changing economic conditions or other factors, or if such changes adversely affect our borrowers’ willingness or capacity to repay their loans, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity would be materially adversely affected.There are risks associated with the acquisition or sale of assets or businesses and the formation, termination or operation of joint ventures or other strategic alliances, including the possibility of increased delinquencies and losses, difficulties with integrating loans into our servicing platform and disruption to our ongoing business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We have previously acquired, and in the future may acquire, assets or businesses, including large portfolios of finance receivables, either through the direct purchase of such assets or the purchase of the equity of a company with such a portfolio. Since we will not have originated or serviced the loans we acquire, we may not be aware of legal or other deficiencies related to origination or servicing, and our review of the portfolio prior to purchase may not uncover those deficiencies. Further, we may have limited recourse against the seller of the portfolio.Potential difficulties we may encounter in connection with these transactions and arrangements include, but are not limited to, the following: the integration of the assets or business into our information technology platforms and servicing systems; the quality of servicing; disruption of our ongoing businesses and distraction of our management teams; incomplete or inaccurate records; inability to retain existing customers; unanticipated expenses; and potential unknown liabilities associated with the transactions, including legal liability related to origination and servicing prior to the acquisition.The anticipated benefits and synergies of our future acquisitions will assume a successful integration, and will be based on projections, which are inherently uncertain, as well as other assumptions. Even if integration is successful, anticipated benefits and synergies may not be achieved.If our estimates of allowance for finance receivable losses are not adequate to absorb actual losses, our provision for finance receivable losses would increase, which could adversely affect our results of operations.We maintain an allowance for finance receivable losses. To estimate the appropriate level of allowance for finance receivable losses, we consider known and relevant internal and external factors that affect finance receivable collectability, including the total amount of finance receivables outstanding, historical finance receivable charge-offs, our current collection patterns, and current and forecasted economic trends. Our methodology for establishing our allowance for finance receivable losses is based on the guidance from Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, which requires us to measure expected credit losses for financial assets at each reporting date. The allowance is primarily based on historical experience, current conditions, and our reasonable and supportable forecast of economic conditions. If customer behavior changes as a result of economic conditions and if we are unable to accurately predict how the unemployment rates, personal bankruptcy filings, and general economic conditions may affect our allowance for finance receivable losses, our allowance for finance receivable losses may be inadequate. Our allowance for finance receivable losses is an estimate, and if actual finance receivable losses are materially greater than our allowance for finance receivable losses, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Neither state regulators nor federal regulators regulate our allowance for finance receivable losses.22Table of Contents Our risk management efforts may not be effective.We could incur substantial losses and our business operations could be disrupted if we are unable to effectively identify, manage, monitor, and mitigate financial risks, such as credit risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk, liquidity risk, and other market-related risks, as well as operational risks related to our business, assets and liabilities. To the extent our models used to assess the creditworthiness of potential borrowers do not adequately identify potential risks, the valuations produced will not adequately represent the risk profile of the borrowers and could result in a riskier finance receivables profile than originally identified. Our risk management policies, procedures, and techniques, including our scoring technology, may not be sufficient to identify all of the risks we are exposed to, mitigate the risks we have identified or identify concentrations of risk or additional risks to which we may become subject in the future. We also face new risks as a result of COVID-19 and the significant increase in our remote work force and digital operations. These risks may not be adequately captured by our existing risk management framework.Changes in market conditions, including rising interest rates, could adversely affect the rate at which our borrowers prepay their loans and the value of our finance receivables portfolio, as well as increase our financing cost, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Changing market conditions, the availability of credit, the relative economic vitality of the area in which our borrowers and their assets are located, changes in tax laws, other opportunities for investment available to our customers, homeowner mobility, and other economic, social, geographic, demographic, and legal factors beyond our control, may affect the rates at which our borrowers prepay their loans. Generally, in situations where prepayment rates have slowed, the weighted-average life of our finance receivables has increased. Any increase in interest rates may further slow the rate of prepayment for our finance receivables, which could adversely affect our liquidity by reducing the cash flows from, and the value of, the finance receivables we hold for sale or utilize as collateral in our secured funding transactions.Moreover, our finance receivables are fixed-rate and generally decline in value if interest rates increase. As such, if changing market conditions cause interest rates to increase substantially, the value of our finance receivables could decline. Some jurisdictions limit the maximum interest rate that we may charge on a certain population of our loans so we have limited ability to increase the interest rate on our loans made in those jurisdictions. Our yield, as well as our cash flows from operations and results of operations, could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to increase the interest rates charged on new loans to offset any increases in our cost of funds. Accordingly, any increase in interest rates could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We may be required to indemnify or repurchase finance receivables from purchasers of finance receivables that we have sold or securitized, or which we will sell or securitize in the future, if our finance receivables fail to meet certain criteria or characteristics or under other circumstances, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.The documents governing our finance receivable sales and securitizations contain provisions that require us to indemnify the purchasers of securitized finance receivables, or to repurchase the affected finance receivables, under certain circumstances. While our sale and securitization documents vary, they generally contain customary provisions that may require us to repurchase finance receivables if:•our representations and warranties concerning the quality and characteristics of the finance receivable are inaccurate;•there is borrower fraud; or•we fail to comply, at the individual finance receivable level or otherwise, with regulatory requirements in connection with the origination and servicing of the finance receivables.At its maximum, our exposure to repurchases or our indemnification obligations under our representations and warranties could include the current unpaid balance of all finance receivables that we have sold or securitized, and which are not subject to settlement agreements with purchasers.The risk of loss on the finance receivables that we have securitized is recognized in our allowance for finance receivable losses since all of our loan securitizations are recorded on our balance sheet. If we are required to indemnify purchasers or repurchase finance receivables that we sell or have sold that result in losses or recognize losses on securitized finance receivables that exceed our recorded allowance for finance receivable losses associated with our securitizations, this could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.23Table of Contents Our business and reputation may be materially impacted by information system failures, cyber threats, or network disruptions.Our business relies heavily on information systems to deliver products and services to our customers, and to manage our ongoing operations. These systems may encounter service disruptions due to system, network or software failure, security breaches, computer viruses, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions. In addition, denial-of-service attacks could overwhelm our internet sites and prevent us from adequately serving customers. Cyber threats are constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. We also may face new or heightened risk due to the increase in our remote workforce and digital operations. We may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities, which may allow them to persist in our system environment over long periods of time. Cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our computer systems and networks and those of our third-party vendors. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and our business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient to adequately address the disruption. A disruption could impair our ability to offer and process our loans, provide customer service, perform collections or other necessary business activities, which could result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. There may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personally identifiable information, that could subject us to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.Our operations rely heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential customer and other information including, among other things, PII, in our computer systems and networks, as well as those of third parties. Our branch offices and centralized servicing centers, as well as our administrative and executive offices, are part of an electronic information network that is designed to permit us to originate and track finance receivables and collections and perform other tasks that are part of our everyday operations. Additionally, as a result of COVID-19 and the significant increase in our remote work force and digital operations, our vulnerability to unauthorized access to confidential information may increase. We devote significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect our computer systems and data. These security measures may not be sufficient and may be vulnerable to hacking, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our computer systems. Any failure, interruption, or breach in our cyber security could result in reputational harm, disruption of our customer relationships, or our inability to originate, process and service our finance receivable products. Further, any of these cyber security and operational risks could expose us to lawsuits by customers for identity theft or other damages resulting from data breach involving PII or misuse of their PII and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, regulators may impose penalties and/or require remedial action if they identify weaknesses in our security systems, and we may be required to incur significant costs to increase our cyber security to address any vulnerabilities that may be discovered or to remediate the harm caused by any security breaches. As part of our business, we may share confidential customer information and proprietary information with customers, vendors, service providers, and business partners. The information systems of these third parties may be vulnerable to security breaches and, despite our best efforts, we may not be able to ensure that these third parties have appropriate security controls in place to protect the information we share with them. If our confidential information is intercepted, stolen, misused, or mishandled while in possession of a third party, it could result in reputational harm to us, loss of customer business, and additional regulatory scrutiny, and it could expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Although we have insurance that is intended to cover certain losses from such events, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate or available.We are also subject to the theft or misuse of physical customer and employee records at our facilities.Our branch offices and centralized servicing centers have physical customer records necessary for day-to-day operations that contain confidential information about our customers. We also retain physical records in various storage locations. The loss or theft of customer information from our branch offices, central servicing facilities, or other storage locations could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and penalties and could expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, which could 24Table of Contents have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, if we cannot locate original documents (or copies, in some cases) for certain finance receivables, we may not be able to collect on those finance receivables.Our insurance operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including claims, catastrophic events, underwriting risks and dependence on a primary distribution channel.Insurance claims and policyholder liabilities are difficult to predict and may exceed the related reserves set aside for claims (losses) and associated expenses for claims adjudication (loss adjustment expenses). Additionally, events such as natural disasters, pandemic disease, cyber security breaches and other types of catastrophes, and prolonged economic downturns, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Other risks relating to our insurance operations include changes to laws and regulations applicable to us, as well as changes to the regulatory environment, such as: changes to laws or regulations affecting capital and reserve requirements; frequency and type of regulatory monitoring and reporting; consumer privacy, use of customer data and data security; benefits or loss ratio requirements; insurance producer licensing or appointment requirements; required disclosures to consumers; and collateral protection insurance (i.e., insurance some of our lender companies purchase, at the customer’s expense, on that customer’s loan collateral for the periods of time the customer fails to adequately, as required by the customer's loan, insure the collateral). Because our customers do not directly agree to the amount charged for collateral protection at the time it is purchased, regulators may in the future prohibit our insurance companies from providing this insurance to our lending operations. Moreover, our insurance companies are predominately dependent on our lending operations as the primary source of business and product distribution. If our lending operations discontinue offering insurance products, including as a result of regulatory requirements or rate caps, our insurance operations would need to find an alternate distribution partner for their products, of which there can be no assurance.Our use of derivatives exposes us to credit and market risks.From time to time, we may enter into derivative financial instruments for economic hedging purposes, such as managing our exposure to interest rate risk. By using derivative instruments, we are exposed to credit and market risks, including the risk of loss associated with variations in the spread between the asset yield and the funding and/or hedge cost, default risk, and the risk of insolvency or other inability of the counterparty to a particular derivative financial instrument to perform its obligations.We may not be able to make technological improvements as quickly as some of our competitors, which could harm our ability to compete and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial and lending institutions to better serve customers and reduce costs. Our future success and, in particular, the success of our centralized operations, will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services as quickly as some of our competitors or be successful in marketing these products and services to our existing and new customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could harm our ability to compete with our competitors and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.If goodwill and other intangible assets become impaired, it could have a negative impact on our profitability.Goodwill represents the amount of acquisition cost over the fair value of net assets we acquired. If the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Any such adjustments are reflected in our results of operations in the periods in which the impairments become known. There can be no assurance that our future evaluations of goodwill and other intangible assets will not result in findings of impairments and related write-downs, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.25Table of Contents Damage to our reputation could adversely impact our business and financial results.Our ability to attract and retain customers and employees is significantly impacted by our reputation. Damage to our reputation can arise from a number of circumstances as a result of our actions or those of our employees or as a result of negative public opinion about the financial services industry generally. Negative public opinion can result from a number of sources, such as our lending practices, cybersecurity breaches, failures to safeguard personal information, discriminating or harassing behavior of employees toward other employees or customers, compensation practices, sales practices, environmental, social, and governance practices and disclosures, failure or perceived failure of us, our customers, or other parties to comply with laws or regulations, including companies we have made investments, and vendors with which we do business. Such negative attention and publicity directed at us could generate dissatisfaction among our customers and employees. Although we have policies and procedures in place intended to prevent and detect conduct by team members and third-party service providers that could potentially harm customers or our reputation, we cannot assure you that such policies and procedures will be fully effective in preventing such conduct. Furthermore, our actual or perceived failure to address or prevent any such conduct or otherwise to effectively manage our business or operations could result in significant reputational harm.RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY AND REGULATIONWe operate in a highly competitive market, and we cannot ensure that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.The consumer finance industry is highly competitive. Our profitability depends, in large part, on our ability to underwrite and originate finance receivables. We compete with other consumer finance companies as well as other types of financial institutions that offer similar consumer financial products and services. Some of these competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we possess. Some competitors may also have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that may not be available to us. Banks and credit card companies, which had focused largely on prime customers following the financial crisis, have resumed lending to non-prime customers. This shift could increase competition in the markets in which we operate. Increased regulatory pressure on payday lenders could cause many of those lenders to start making more traditional installment consumer loans in order to reduce regulatory scrutiny of their practices. We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our businesses are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business and failure to comply with such regulations may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our businesses are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations, and various state authorities regulate and supervise our insurance operations. The laws under which a substantial amount of our consumer and real estate businesses are conducted generally: provide for state licensing of lenders and, in some cases, licensing of employees involved in real estate loans, including loan modifications; impose limits on the terms of consumer credit, including amounts, interest rates and charges; regulate whether and under what circumstances insurance and other optional products may be offered to consumers in connection with a consumer credit transaction; regulate the manner in which we use personal data; and provide for other consumer protections.We are also subject to extensive servicing regulations with which we must comply when servicing our legacy real estate loans and servicing loan portfolios on behalf of other parties. Additionally, we will have to comply with these servicing regulations if we acquire loan portfolios in the future and assume the servicing obligations for the acquired loans or other financial assets. The extent of state regulation of our insurance business varies by product and by jurisdiction, but relates primarily to the following: licensing; conduct of business; periodic examination of the affairs of insurers; form and content of required financial reports; standards of solvency; limitations on dividend payments and other affiliate transactions; types of products offered; approval of policy forms and premium rates; formulas to calculate any unearned premium refund due to an insured customer; permissible investments; deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders; reserve requirements for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes; and claims processing.All of our operations are subject to regular examination by state regulators and, certain aspects of our business, by federal regulators. As a whole, our entities are subject to several hundred regulatory examinations in a given year. These examinations may result in requirements to change our policies or practices, and in some cases, we are required to pay monetary fines or make reimbursements to customers. Many state regulators and some federal regulators have indicated an intention to pool their resources in order to conduct examinations of licensed entities, including us, at the same time (referred to as a “multi-state” examination). This could result in more in-depth examinations, which could be costlier and lead to more significant 26Table of Contents enforcement actions.We are also subject to potential enforcement, supervisions and other actions that may be brought by state attorneys general or other state enforcement authorities and other governmental agencies. Any such actions could subject us to civil money penalties, customer remediation and increased compliance costs, as well as damage our reputation and brand and could limit or prohibit our ability to offer certain products and services or engage in certain business practices.State attorneys general have stated their intention to fill any void left by diminished CFPB enforcement and have a variety of tools at their disposal to enforce state and federal consumer financial laws. First, Section 1042 of the Dodd-Frank Act grants state attorneys general the ability to enforce the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act’s authority and to secure remedies provided in the Dodd-Frank Act against entities within their jurisdiction. State attorneys general also have enforcement authority under state law with respect to unfair or deceptive practices. Generally, under these statutes, state attorneys general may conduct investigations, bring actions, and recover civil penalties or obtain injunctive relief against entities engaging in unfair, deceptive, or fraudulent acts. Attorneys general may also coordinate among themselves to enter into multi-state actions or settlements. Then, several consumer financial laws like the Truth in Lending Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act grant enforcement or litigation authority to state attorneys general. If there is a perception of diminished CFPB enforcement, there may be an increase in actions brought by state attorneys general.We are subject to potential changes in federal and state law, which could lower the interest-rate limit that non-depository financial institutions may charge for consumer loans or could expand the definition of interest under federal and state law to include the cost of optional products, such as insurance. Such changes could limit our interest income, insurance revenues, and other revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.We believe that we maintain all material licenses and permits required for our current operations and are in substantial compliance with all applicable federal, state and local regulations, but we may not be able to maintain all requisite licenses and permits, and the failure to satisfy those and other regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, changes in laws or regulations applicable to us could subject us to additional licensing, registration and other regulatory requirements in the future or could adversely affect our ability to operate or the manner in which we conduct business.A material failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in regulatory actions, including substantial fines or penalties, lawsuits and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.For more information with respect to the regulatory framework affecting our businesses, see “Business—Regulation” included in this report.Requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and oversight by the CFPB significantly increase our regulatory costs and burdens.The Dodd-Frank Act was adopted in 2010. This law and the related regulations affect our operations in terms of increased oversight of financial services products by the CFPB, and the imposition of restrictions on the allowable terms for certain consumer credit transactions. The CFPB has significant authority to implement and enforce federal consumer finance laws, including the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act and new requirements for financial services products provided for in the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the authority to identify and prohibit unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provides the CFPB with broad supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over various consumer financial products and services, including the ability to require reimbursements and other payments to customers for alleged legal violations, and to impose significant penalties, as well as injunctive relief that prohibits lenders from engaging in allegedly unlawful practices. Further, state attorneys general and state regulators are authorized to bring civil actions to enforce certain consumer protection provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The industry investigation and enforcement provisions of Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act may adversely affect our business if the CFPB or one or more state attorneys general or state regulators believe that we have violated any federal consumer financial protection laws, including the prohibition in Title X against unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices.The CFPB currently has supervisory authority over our real estate servicing activities, and may in the future have supervisory authority over at least portions of our consumer lending business. It also has the authority to bring enforcement actions for violations of laws over which it has jurisdiction regardless of whether it has supervisory authority for a given product or service. Effective in January 2014, the CFPB finalized mortgage servicing regulations, which makes it more difficult and expensive to service mortgages. The Dodd-Frank Act also gives the CFPB supervisory authority over entities that are 27Table of Contents designated as “larger participants” in certain financial services markets. The CFPB has published regulations for “larger participants” in the market of auto finance, and we have been designated as a larger participant in this market. The larger-participant rule for consumer installment loans was one of the rulemaking initiatives the CFPB designated as inactive in its Spring 2018 rulemaking agenda. It is not known if or when the CFPB may consider reactivating the rulemaking process for the larger participant rule for consumer installment loans. The CFPB’s broad supervisory and enforcement powers could affect our business and operations significantly in terms of increased operating and regulatory compliance costs, and limits on the types of products we offer and the manner in which they are offered, among other things. See “Business—Regulation” included in this report for further information on the CFPB.The CFPB and certain state regulators have acted against some lenders regarding, for instance, debt collection and the marketing of optional products offered by the lenders in connection with their loans. The products included debt cancellation/suspension products and other types of payment protection insurance. We collect on delinquent debt. We also sell optional insurance and non-insurance products in connection with our loans. Our debt collection practices and sales of optional insurance and non-insurance products could be challenged in a similar manner by the CFPB or state consumer lending regulators.Some of the rulemaking under the Dodd-Frank Act remains to be done. As a result, the complete impact of the Dodd-Frank Act remains uncertain. It is not clear what form remaining regulations will ultimately take, or how our business will be affected. No assurance can be given that the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations or any other new legislative changes enacted will not have a significant impact on our business.For more information with respect to the regulatory framework affecting our businesses, see “Business—Regulation” included in this report.Current and proposed regulations relating to consumer privacy, data protection and information security could increase our costs.We are subject to a number of federal and state consumer privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations. For example, we are subject to the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which governs the use of PII by financial institutions. Moreover, various state laws and regulations may require us to notify customers, employees, state attorneys general, regulators and others in the event of a security breach. Federal and state legislators and regulators are increasingly pursuing new guidance, laws, and regulations relating to consumer privacy, data protection and information security. Compliance with current or future consumer privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations could result in higher compliance, technology or other operating costs. Any violations of these laws and regulations may require us to change our business practices or operational structure, and could subject us to material legal claims, monetary penalties, sanctions, and the obligation to compensate and/or notify customers, employees, state attorneys general, regulators and others or take other remedial actions.Our use of third-party vendors is subject to regulatory review.Recently, the CFPB and other regulators have issued regulatory guidance focusing on the need for financial institutions to perform due diligence and ongoing monitoring of third-party vendor relationships which increases the scope of management involvement and decreases the benefit that we receive from using third-party vendors. Moreover, if our regulators conclude that we have not met the standards for oversight of our third-party vendors, we could be subject to enforcement actions, civil monetary penalties, supervisory orders to cease and desist or other remedial actions, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and operating results. Further, federal and state regulators have been scrutinizing the practices of lead aggregators and providers recently.  If regulators place restrictions on certain practices by lead aggregators or providers, our ability to use them as a source for applicants could be affected.We purchase and sell finance receivables, including charged-off receivables and receivables where the borrower is in default. This practice could subject us to heightened regulatory scrutiny, which may expose us to legal action, cause us to incur losses and/or limit or impede our collection activity.As part of our business model, we purchase and sell finance receivables. Although the borrowers for some of these finance receivables are current on their payments, other borrowers may be in default (including in bankruptcy) or the debt may have been charged off as uncollectible. Recently, the CFPB and other regulators have significantly increased their scrutiny of the purchase and sale of debt, and collections practices undertaken by purchasers of debt, especially delinquent and charged-off debt. The CFPB has scrutinized sellers of debt for not maintaining sufficient documentation to support and verify the validity or 28Table of Contents amount of the debt. It has also scrutinized debt collectors for, among other things, their collection tactics, attempting to collect debts that no longer are valid, misrepresenting the amount of the debt and not having sufficient documentation to verify the validity or amount of the debt. Our purchases or sales of receivables could expose us to lawsuits or fines by regulators if we do not have sufficient documentation to support and verify the validity and amount of the finance receivables underlying these transactions, or if we or purchasers of our finance receivables use collection methods that are viewed as unfair or abusive. In addition, our collections could suffer, and we may incur additional expenses if we are required to change collection practices or stop collecting on certain debts as a result of a lawsuit or action on the part of regulators.Changes in law and regulatory developments could result in significant additional compliance costs relating to securitizations.The Dodd-Frank Act and related rulemaking and regulatory developments has resulted, and will continue to result, in the incurrence of additional compliance costs in connection with securitization transactions. The Dodd-Frank Act requires, among other things, that a securitizer retain at least a 5% economic interest in the credit risk of the securitized assets; this requirement has reduced and will continue to reduce the amount of financing obtained from such transactions. Furthermore, sponsors are prohibited from diluting the required risk retention by dividing the economic interest among multiple parties or hedging or transferring the credit risk the sponsor is required to maintain.Rules relating to securitizations rated by nationally-recognized statistical rating agencies require that the findings of any third-party due diligence service providers be made publicly available at least five (5) business days prior to the first sale of securities, which has led and will continue to lead us to incur additional costs in connection with each securitization.We may have to constrain our business activities to avoid being deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act.The Investment Company Act imposes a regulatory regime that regulates the manner in which “investment companies” are permitted to conduct their business activities. We believe we have conducted, and intend to continue to conduct, our business in a manner that does not result in the Company being characterized as an investment company, including relying on certain exemptions from registration as an investment company. We rely on guidance published by the SEC staff or on our analyses of such guidance to determine our qualification under these and other exemptions. To the extent that the SEC staff publishes new or different guidance with respect to these matters, we may be required to adjust our business operations accordingly. Any additional guidance from the SEC staff could provide additional flexibility to us, or it could inhibit our ability to conduct our business operations. We cannot assure you that the laws and regulations governing our Investment Company Act status or SEC guidance regarding the Investment Company Act will not change in a manner that adversely affects our operations. If we are deemed to be an investment company, we may attempt to seek exempting relief from the SEC, which could impose significant costs and delays on our business. We may not receive such relief on a timely basis, if at all, and such relief may require us to modify or curtail our operations. If we are deemed to be an investment company, we may also be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted.RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESSAn inability to access adequate sources of liquidity may adversely affect our ability to fund operational requirements and satisfy financial obligations.Our ability to access capital and credit may be significantly affected by disruption in the U.S. credit markets and the associated credit rating downgrades on our debt. In addition, the risk of volatility surrounding the global economic system and uncertainty surrounding regulatory reforms, such as the Dodd-Frank Act, continue to create uncertainty around access to the capital markets. Historically, we have funded our operations and repaid our debt and other obligations using funds collected from our finance receivable portfolio and new debt issuances. Our current corporate credit ratings are below investment grade and, as a result, our borrowing costs may further increase and our ability to borrow may be limited. In addition to issuing unsecured debt in the public and private markets, we have raised capital through securitization transactions and, although there can be no assurances that we will be able to complete additional securitizations or issue additional unsecured debt, we currently expect our near-term sources of capital markets funding to continue to derive from securitization transactions and unsecured debt offerings.Any future capital markets transactions will be dependent on our financial performance as well as market conditions, which may result in receiving financing on terms less favorable to us than our existing financings. In addition, our access to future 29Table of Contents financing and our ability to refinance existing debt will depend on a variety of factors such as our financial performance, the general availability of credit, our credit ratings and credit capacity at the time we pursue such financing.If we are unable to complete additional securitization transactions or unsecured debt offerings on a timely basis or upon terms acceptable to us or otherwise access adequate sources of liquidity, our ability to fund our own operational requirements and satisfy financial obligations may be adversely affected.Our indebtedness is significant, which could affect our ability to meet our obligations under our debt instruments and could materially and adversely affect our business and ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry.Our significant indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:•it may require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of our indebtedness, which reduces the funds available for other purposes, including finance receivable originations and capital returns;•it could limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing regulatory, business and economic conditions;•it may limit our ability to incur additional borrowings or securitizations for working capital, capital expenditures, business development, debt service requirements, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes, or to refinance our indebtedness;•it may require us to seek to change the maturity, interest rate and other terms of our existing debt;•it may place us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors that are not as highly leveraged;•it may cause a downgrade of our debt and long-term corporate ratings; and•it may cause us to be more vulnerable to periods of negative or slow growth in the general economy or in our business.In addition, meeting our anticipated liquidity requirements is contingent upon our continued compliance with our existing debt agreements. An event of default or declaration of acceleration under one of our existing debt agreements could also result in an event of default and declaration of acceleration under certain of our other existing debt agreements. Such an acceleration of our debt would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to continue as a going concern. If our debt obligations increase, whether due to the increased cost of existing indebtedness or the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the consequences described above could be magnified. There can be no assurance that we will be able to repay or refinance our debt in the future.Certain of our outstanding notes contain covenants that restrict our operations and may inhibit our ability to grow our business and increase revenues.OMFC’s indenture and certain of OMFC’s notes contain a covenant that limits OMFC’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to create or incur liens. The restrictions may interfere with our ability to obtain additional financing or may affect the manner in which we structure such financing or engage in other business activities, which may significantly limit or harm our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. A default and resulting acceleration of obligations could also result in an event of default and declaration of acceleration under certain of our other existing debt agreements. Such an acceleration of our debt would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to continue as a going concern. A default could also significantly limit our alternatives to refinance the debt under which the default occurred as well as other indebtedness. This limitation may significantly restrict our financing options during times of either market distress or our financial distress, which are precisely the times when having financing options is most important.The assessment of our liquidity is based upon significant judgments and estimates that could prove to be materially incorrect.In assessing our current financial position and developing operating plans for the future, management has made significant judgments and estimates with respect to our liquidity, including but not limited to:•our ability to generate sufficient cash to service all of our outstanding debt;•our continued ability to access debt and securitization markets and other sources of funding on favorable terms;•our ability to complete on favorable terms, as needed, additional borrowings, securitizations, finance receivable portfolio sales, or other transactions to support liquidity, and the costs associated with these funding sources, 30Table of Contents including sales at less than carrying value and limits on the types of assets that can be securitized or sold, which would affect our profitability;•the potential for downgrade of our debt by rating agencies, which would have a negative impact on our cost of, and access to, capital;•our ability to comply with our debt covenants;•our ability to make capital returns to OMH's stockholders;•the amount of cash expected to be received from our finance receivable portfolio through collections (including prepayments) and receipt of finance charges, which could be materially different than our estimates;•the potential for declining financial flexibility and reduced income should we use more of our assets for securitizations and finance receivable portfolio sales; and•the potential for reduced income due to the possible deterioration of the credit quality of our finance receivable portfolios.Additionally, there are numerous risks to our financial results, liquidity, and capital raising and debt refinancing plans that are not quantified in our current liquidity forecasts. These risks include, but are not limited, to the following:•our inability to grow our personal loan portfolio with adequate profitability to fund operations, loan losses, and other expenses;•our inability to monetize assets including, but not limited to, our access to debt and securitization markets;•our inability to obtain the additional necessary funding to finance our operations;•the effect of current and potential new federal, state and local laws, regulations, or regulatory policies and practices on our ability to conduct business or the manner in which we conduct business, as well as changes that may result from increased regulatory scrutiny of the sub-prime lending industry;•potential liability relating to real estate and personal loans which we have sold or may sell in the future, or relating to securitized loans, if it is determined that there was a non-curable breach of a warranty made in connection with the transaction;•the potential for increasing costs and difficulty in servicing our loan portfolio as a result of heightened regulatory scrutiny of loan servicing and foreclosure practices in the industry generally;•the potential for additional unforeseen cash demands or acceleration of obligations;•reduced income due to loan modifications where the borrower’s interest rate is reduced, principal payments are deferred, or other concessions are made;•the potential for declines or volatility in bond and equity markets; and•the potential effect on us if the capital levels of our regulated and unregulated subsidiaries prove inadequate to support our current business plans.The actual outcome of one or more of our plans could be materially different than expected or one or more of our significant judgments or estimates about the potential effects of these risks and uncertainties could prove to be materially incorrect. In the event of such an occurrence, if third-party financing is not available, our liquidity could be materially adversely affected, and as a result, substantial doubt could exist about our ability to continue as a going concern.OMFC's credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to raise capital in the debt markets at attractive rates, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.S&P, Moody’s, and KBRA rate OMFC’s debt. Ratings reflect the rating agencies’ opinions of a company’s financial strength, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating.The table below outlines OMFC’s long-term corporate debt ratings and outlook by rating agencies:As of December 31, 2020RatingOutlookS&PBB-StableMoody’sBa3StableKBRABB+Stable31Table of Contents Currently, no other entity has a corporate debt rating, though they may be rated in the future. If OMFC’s current ratings are downgraded, it will likely increase the interest rate that we would have to pay to raise money in the capital markets, making it more expensive for us to borrow money and adversely impacting our access to capital. As a result, a downgrade of OMFC's ratings could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our securitizations may expose us to financing and other risks, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to access the securitization market in the future, which may require us to seek more costly financing.Although we have successfully completed a number of securitizations since 2013, we can give no assurances that we will be able to complete additional securitizations if the securitization markets become constrained. In addition, the value of any subordinated securities that we may retain in our securitizations might be reduced or, in some cases, eliminated as a result of an adverse change in economic conditions or the financial markets.OMFC, OMFG, and OMFH currently act as the servicers with respect to the personal loan securitization trusts and related series of asset-backed securities. If OMFC, OMFG, or OMFH defaults in its servicing obligations, an early amortization event could occur with respect to the relevant asset-backed securities and OMFC, OMFG, or OMFH, as applicable, could be replaced as servicer. Servicer defaults include, for example, the failure of the servicer to make any payment, transfer or deposit in accordance with the securitization documents, a breach of representations, warranties or agreements made by the servicer under the securitization documents and the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the servicer. Such an early amortization event could damage our reputation and have materially adverse consequences on our liquidity and cost of funds.Rating agencies may also affect our ability to execute a securitization transaction or increase the costs we expect to incur from executing securitization transactions, not only by deciding not to issue ratings for our securitization transactions, but also by altering the criteria and process they follow in issuing ratings. Rating agencies could alter their ratings processes or criteria after we have accumulated finance receivables for securitization in a manner that effectively reduces the value of those finance receivables by increasing our financing costs or otherwise requiring that we incur additional costs to comply with those processes and criteria. We have no ability to control or predict what actions the rating agencies may take in this regard.Further, other matters, such as (i) accounting standards applicable to securitization transactions and (ii) capital and leverage requirements applicable to banks and other regulated financial institutions' asset-backed securities, could result in decreased investor demand for securities issued through our securitization transactions, or increased competition from other institutions that undertake securitization transactions. In addition, compliance with certain regulatory requirements, including the Dodd-Frank Act and the Investment Company Act, may affect the type of securitizations that we are able to complete.If it is not possible or economical for us to securitize our finance receivables in the future, we would need to seek alternative financing to support our operations and to meet our existing debt obligations, which may be less efficient and more expensive than raising capital via securitizations and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.RISKS RELATED TO OUR ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTUREThe Apollo-Värde Group is OMH's largest stockholder, and may exercise significant influence over us, including through its ability to designate a majority of the members of the board of directors, and its interests may conflict with the interests of OMH's other stockholders.The Apollo-Värde Group's holdings represent approximately 40.9% of OMH's outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2020. The Apollo-Värde Group is OMH's largest stockholder and has significant influence on all matters requiring a stockholder vote. This concentration of ownership may delay, deter or prevent acts that would be favored by OMH's other stockholders, including delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of OMH or a merger, takeover or other business combination that may be otherwise favorable to us or OMH's other stockholders. As a result, stockholders might not receive a premium over the then-current market price of OMH's common stock upon a change in control. See additional information under “Business Overview” in Item 1 of this report.In connection with the closing of the Apollo-Värde Transaction, OMH entered into an Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement, which provides the Apollo-Värde Group with the right to designate a majority of the members of the board of directors, plus one director, for so long as the Apollo-Värde Group and certain of its affiliates and 32Table of Contents permitted transferees continue to beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least 33% of OMH's issued and outstanding common stock. With such representation on the board of directors, the Apollo-Värde Group is able to exercise significant influence over decisions affecting OMH, including its direction and policies, the appointment of management and any action requiring the vote of its board of directors. The interests of the Apollo-Värde Group may not always coincide with OMH's interests or the interests of OMH's other stockholders. The Apollo-Värde Group may seek to cause OMH to take courses of action that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment in OMH, but which might involve risks or adversely affect OMH or its other stockholders. The terms of the Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement are further described in OMH's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 25, 2018. The Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to that Current Report on Form 8-K, and such Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 10.1 thereto, is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.In addition, the Apollo-Värde Group and its affiliates may conduct business with any business that is competitive or in the same line of business as us, do business with any of our clients, customers or vendors, make investments in the kind of property in which we may make investments or acquire the same or similar types of assets that we may seek to acquire and may in the future acquire interests in or provide advice to businesses that directly or indirectly compete with our business or are vendors or customers.OMH and OMFC are holding companies with no operations and rely on our operating subsidiaries to provide us with funds necessary to meet our financial obligations and enable us to pay dividends.Our principal assets are the equity interests we directly or indirectly hold in our operating subsidiaries, which own our operating assets. As a result, we are dependent on loans, dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations and enable OMH to pay dividends on its common stock. Our subsidiaries are legally distinct from us and certain of our subsidiaries are prohibited or restricted from paying dividends or otherwise making funds available to us under certain conditions. For example, our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit their ability to pay dividends or make loans or advances to us, principally to protect policyholders, and certain of OMFC's debt agreements limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. If we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries, or if our subsidiaries do not generate sufficient cash from operations, we may be unable to meet our financial obligations or pay dividends, and the board may exercise its discretion not to pay dividends.OMH may not pay dividends on its common stock in the future, even if liquidity and leverage targets are met.While OMH intends to pay its minimum quarterly dividends, currently $0.45 per share, for the foreseeable future, and has announced its intention to evaluate dividends above the minimum every first and third quarters, all subsequent dividends will be reviewed and declared at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, cash flows, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applicable to the payment of dividends, and other considerations that the board of directors deems relevant. As a result, we cannot assure you that OMH will continue to pay dividends on its common stock  in the future periods, even if liquidity and target leverage objectives are met. See our “Dividend Policy” in Part II - Item 5 of this report for further information. Certain provisions of an amended and restated stockholders agreement with the Apollo-Värde Group, restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could hinder, delay or prevent a change in control of OMH, which could adversely affect the price of OMH's common stock.Certain provisions of the Stockholders Agreement, OMH's restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of the board of directors or the Apollo-Värde Group. These provisions provide for:•a classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms;•certain rights to the Apollo-Värde Group and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees with respect to the designation of directors for nomination and election to the board of directors, including the ability to appoint a majority of the members of the board of directors, plus one director, for so long as the Apollo-Värde Group and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees continue to beneficially own, directly or indirectly at least 33% of OMH's issued and outstanding common stock;•removal of directors only for cause and only with the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the voting interest of stockholders entitled to vote (provided, however, that for so long as the Apollo-Värde Group and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least 30% of OMH's issued and 33Table of Contents outstanding common stock, directors may be removed with or without cause with the affirmative vote of a majority of the then issued and outstanding voting interest of stockholders entitled to vote);•no ability for stockholders to call special meetings of OMH's stockholders (provided, however, that for so long as the Apollo-Värde Group and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least 20% of OMH's issued and outstanding common stock, any stockholders that collectively beneficially own at least 20% of OMH's issued and outstanding common stock may call special meetings of our stockholders);•advance notice requirements by stockholders with respect to director nominations and actions to be taken at annual meetings;•the ability for stockholders to act outside a meeting by written consent only if unanimous, provided, however, that for so long as the Apollo-Värde Group and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least 20% of OMH's issued and outstanding common stock, OMH's stockholders may act without a meeting by written consent of a majority of OMH's stockholders; and•the issuance of blank check preferred stock by the board of directors from time to time in one or more series and to establish the terms, preferences and rights of any such series of preferred stock, all without approval of OMH stockholders. Nothing in OMH's restated certificate of incorporation precludes future issuances without stockholder approval of the authorized but unissued shares of OMH's common stock.In addition, these provisions may make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a tender offer, change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by the Apollo-Värde Group, our management or the board of directors. Public stockholders who might desire to participate in these types of transactions may not have an opportunity to do so, even if the transaction is favorable to stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to benefit from a change in control or change our management and board of directors and, as a result, may adversely affect the market price of OMH's common stock and the ability of public stockholders to realize any potential change of control premium.See additional information under “Business Overview” in Item 1 of this report. The terms of the Amended and Restated Stockholders’ Agreement are described in OMH's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 25, 2018, and such Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Certain OMH's stockholders have the right to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses as us.The Apollo-Värde Group and its affiliates engage in other investments and business activities in addition to their ownership of OMH. Under OMH's restated certificate of incorporation, the Apollo-Värde Group and its affiliates have the right, and have no duty to abstain from exercising such right, to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses as us, do business with any of our clients, customers or vendors or employ or otherwise engage any of our officers, directors or employees. If the Apollo-Värde Group and its affiliates, or any of their respective officers, directors or employees acquire knowledge of a potential transaction that could be a corporate opportunity, they have no duty, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to offer such corporate opportunity to us, OMH's stockholders or our affiliates.In the event that any of our directors and officers who is also a director, officer or employee of any of the Apollo-Värde Group or its affiliates acquires knowledge of a corporate opportunity or is offered a corporate opportunity, provided that this knowledge was not acquired solely in such person’s capacity as our director or officer and such person acts in good faith, then even if the Apollo-Värde Group or its affiliates pursues or acquires the corporate opportunity or if the Apollo-Värde Group  or its affiliates do not present the corporate opportunity to us, such person is deemed to have fully satisfied such person’s fiduciary duties owed to us and is not liable to us.34Table of Contents Licensing and insurance laws and regulations may delay or impede purchases of OMH's common stock.Certain of the states in which we are licensed to originate loans and the state in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled (Texas) have laws and regulations which require regulatory approval for the acquisition of “control” of regulated entities. In addition, the Texas insurance laws and regulations generally provide that no person may acquire control, directly or indirectly, of a domiciled insurer, unless the person has provided the required information to, and the acquisition is subsequently approved or not disapproved by the Department of Insurance (“DOI”). Under state insurance laws or regulations, there exists a presumption of “control” when an acquiring party acquires as little as 10% of the voting securities of a regulated entity or of a company which itself controls (directly or indirectly) a regulated entity (the threshold is 10% under the insurance statute of Texas). Therefore, any person acquiring 10% or more of OMH's common stock may need the prior approval of the Texas insurance and/or licensing regulators, or a determination from such regulators that “control” has not been acquired, which could significantly delay or otherwise impede their ability to complete such purchase. RISKS RELATED TO FINANCIAL REPORTINGFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that we timely report information as specified in the rules and regulations of the SEC. We also maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable reports and prevent fraud.We believe that a control system, no matter how well designed and managed, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. We may not be able to identify all significant deficiencies and/or material weaknesses in our internal controls in the future, and our failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.Our valuations may include methodologies, models, estimations and assumptions which are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to financial assets and liabilities that may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.The allowance for finance receivable losses is a critical accounting estimate which requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions to determine the appropriate level of allowance. We estimate the allowance for finance receivable losses primarily on historical loss experience using a cumulative loss model applied to our finance receivable portfolio. Our gross loss expectation is offset by the estimate of future recoveries using historical recovery curves on the active portfolio along with accounts that were previously charged-off. We adjust the amounts determined by the model for the impact of management’s economic forecast, such as the levels of unemployment and personal bankruptcy filings, and the effects of model imprecision which include any changes to underwriting criteria and portfolio seasoning. If we are unable to predict certain of these assumptions accurately, our allowance for finance receivable losses may be inadequate. If actual finance receivable losses are materially greater than our allowance for finance receivable losses, our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be adversely affected. We use estimates, assumptions, and judgments when certain financial assets and liabilities are measured and reported at fair value. Fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on quoted market prices and/or other observable inputs provided by independent third-party sources, when available. During periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain assets if trading becomes less frequent or market data becomes less observable. In such cases, certain asset valuations may require significant judgment, and may include inputs and assumptions that require greater estimation, including credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and other relevant inputs. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.35Table of Contents RISKS RELATED TO OMH'S COMMON STOCKThe market price and trading volume of OMH's common stock may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for OMH's stockholders.The market price of OMH's common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations and may decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of OMH's common stock include: variations in our quarterly or annual operating results; changes in our earnings estimates (if provided) or differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts; the contents of published research reports about us or our industry or the failure of securities analysts to cover OMH's common stock in the future; additions to, or departures of, key management personnel; any increased indebtedness we may incur in the future; announcements by us or others and developments affecting us; actions by institutional stockholders or the Apollo-Värde Group; litigation and governmental investigations; changes in market valuations of similar companies; speculation or reports by the press or investment community with respect to us or our industry in general; increases in market interest rates that may lead purchasers of OMH's shares to demand a higher yield; announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments; and general market, political and economic conditions, including any such conditions and local conditions in the markets in which our borrowers are located.These broad company, market and industry factors may decrease the market price of OMH's common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Volatility in the market price of a company’s securities may result in securities class action litigation. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.Future offerings of debt or equity securities by us may adversely affect the market price of OMH's common stock.In the future, we may attempt to obtain financing or to further increase our capital resources by issuing additional shares of OMH's common stock or offering debt or other equity securities, including debt securities convertible into equity or shares of preferred stock. Future acquisitions of consumer finance portfolios and/or consumer finance lending or servicing businesses could require substantial additional capital in excess of cash from operations. We would expect to finance the capital required for acquisitions through a combination of additional issuances of equity, corporate indebtedness, asset-backed acquisition financing and/or cash from operations.Issuing additional shares of OMH's common stock or other equity securities or securities convertible into equity may dilute the economic and voting rights of OMH's stockholders at the time of such issuance or reduce the market price of OMH's common stock or both.  Upon liquidation, holders of debt securities and preferred shares, if issued, and lenders with respect to other borrowings would receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of OMH's common stock. Debt securities convertible into equity could be subject to adjustments in the conversion ratio pursuant to which certain events may increase the number of equity securities issuable upon conversion. Preferred shares, if issued, could have a preference with respect to liquidating distributions or a preference with respect to dividend payments that could limit our ability to pay dividends to the holders of OMH's common stock. Our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of OMH's common stock bear the risk that our future offerings may reduce the market price of OMH's common stock and dilute their stockholdings in us.The market price of OMH's common stock could be negatively affected by sales of substantial amounts of OMH's common stock in the public markets. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 40.9% of OMH's outstanding common stock was held by the Apollo-Värde Group and, subject to certain restrictions set forth in an amended and restated stockholders agreement, can be resold into the public markets in the future in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act. A decline in the price of OMH's common stock, whether as a result of sale of stock by the Apollo-Värde Group or otherwise, might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional common stock or other equity securities.36Table of Contents The future issuance of additional common stock in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions or otherwise will dilute all other stockholdings.OMH has an aggregate of 1,865,651,598 shares of common stock authorized but unissued as of February 1, 2021. OMH may issue all of these shares of common stock without any action or approval by OMH's stockholders, subject to certain exceptions. OMH also intends to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and may issue common stock in connection with these acquisitions. Any common stock issued in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions, the exercise of outstanding stock options or otherwise would dilute the percentage ownership held by existing OMH's stockholders.GENERAL RISKSWe are a party to various lawsuits and proceedings and may become a party to various lawsuits and proceedings in the future which, if resolved in a manner adverse to us, could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.In the normal course of business, from time to time, we have been named, and may be named in the future, as a defendant in various legal actions, including governmental investigations, examinations or other proceedings, arising in connection with our business activities. Certain of the legal actions may include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. Some of these proceedings are pending in jurisdictions that permit damage awards disproportionate to the actual economic damages alleged to have been incurred. A large judgment that is adverse to us could cause our reputation to suffer, encourage additional lawsuits against us and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. For additional information regarding pending legal proceedings and other contingencies, see Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.Certain operations rely on external vendors.We rely on third-party vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations, including a portion of our information systems, communication, data management and transaction processing. Accordingly, we are exposed to the risk that these vendors might not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements or service level agreements because of changes in the vendor’s organizational structure, financial condition, support for existing products and services, or strategic focus. Such failure to perform could be disruptive to our operations and have a materially adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. These third parties are also sources of risk associated with operational errors, system interruptions or breaches and unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If the vendors encounter any of these issues, we could be exposed to disruption of service, damage to reputation and litigation. If we lose the services of any of our key management personnel, our business could suffer.Our future success significantly depends on the continued service and performance of our key management personnel. Competition for these employees is intense and we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel. We do not maintain any “key man” or other related insurance. If we are unable to attract appropriately qualified personnel, we may not be successful in originating loans and servicing our customers, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.Employee misconduct could harm us by subjecting us to monetary loss, significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm.Our reputation is critical to developing and maintaining relationships with our existing and potential customers and third parties with whom we do business. There is a risk that our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. For example, if an employee were to engage—or be accused of engaging—in illegal or suspicious activities including fraud or theft, we could suffer direct losses from the activity, and in addition we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial condition, customer relationships, and ability to attract future customers or employees. Employee misconduct could prompt regulators to allege or to determine, based upon such misconduct, that we have not established adequate supervisory systems and procedures to inform employees of applicable rules or to detect and deter violations of such rules. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent misconduct may not be effective. Misconduct by our employees, or even unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct, could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business.37Table of Contents"

.We face a variety of risks that are inherent in our business. Accordingly, you should carefully consider the following discussion of risks of which we are currently aware that could affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition.  In addition to the factors discussed in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC that could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition, new risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our business or financial performance. Therefore, the risk factors below should not be considered a complete list of potential risks that we may face.Any risk factor described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any of our other SEC filings could by itself, or together with other factors, materially adversely affect our liquidity, competitive position, business, reputation, results of operations or financial condition, including by materially increasing our expenses or decreasing our revenues, which could result in material losses.RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSOur results of operations and financial condition and our borrowers’ ability to make payments on their loans have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by economic conditions and other factors that we cannot control.Uncertainty and deterioration in general economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad historically have created a difficult operating environment for companies involved in consumer lending. Many factors, including factors that are beyond our control, may impact our results of operations or financial condition and/or affect our borrowers’ willingness or capacity to make payments on their loans. These factors include: unemployment levels, housing markets, energy costs and interest rates; events such as natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, catastrophes; events that affect our borrowers, such as major medical expenses, divorce or death; and the quality of any collateral underlying our finance receivables. If we experience an economic downturn, or if we become affected by other events beyond our control, we may experience a significant reduction in revenues, earnings and cash flows, difficulties accessing capital and a deterioration in the value of our investments. We may also become exposed to increased credit risk from our customers and third parties who have obligations to us.Moreover, our customers are primarily non-prime borrowers, who have historically been more likely to be affected, or more severely affected, by adverse macroeconomic conditions than prime borrowers. If a borrower defaults under a finance receivable held directly by us, we will bear a risk of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral, if any, and the outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest on the finance receivable, which could adversely affect our cash flows from operations. The cost to service our loans may also increase without a corresponding increase in our finance charge income.We are exposed to geographic customer concentration risk. An economic downturn or catastrophic event that disproportionately affects certain geographic regions could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, including the performance of our finance receivables portfolio. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for quantification of our largest concentrations of net finance receivables.We cannot assure you that our policies and procedures for underwriting, processing and servicing loans will adequately adapt to adverse economic or other changes. If we fail to adapt to changing economic conditions or other factors, or if such changes adversely affect our borrowers’ willingness or capacity to repay their loans, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity would be materially adversely affected.21Table of Contents There are risks associated with the acquisition or sale of assets or businesses and the formation, termination or operation of joint ventures or other strategic alliances, including the possibility of increased delinquencies and losses, difficulties with integrating loans into our servicing platform and disruption to our ongoing business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We have previously acquired, and in the future may acquire, assets or businesses, including large portfolios of finance receivables, either through the direct purchase of such assets or the purchase of the equity of a company with such a portfolio. Since we will not have originated or serviced the loans we acquire, we may not be aware of legal or other deficiencies related to origination or servicing, and our review of the portfolio prior to purchase may not uncover those deficiencies. Further, we may have limited recourse against the seller of the portfolio.Potential difficulties we may encounter in connection with these transactions and arrangements include, but are not limited to, the following:•the integration of the assets or business into our information technology platforms and servicing systems;•the quality of servicing during any interim servicing period after we purchase a portfolio but before we assume servicing obligations from the seller or its agents;•the disruption to our ongoing businesses and distraction of our management teams from ongoing business concerns;•incomplete or inaccurate files and records;•the retention of existing customers;•the creation of uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems;•the occurrence of unanticipated expenses; and•potential unknown liabilities associated with the transactions, including legal liability related to origination and servicing prior to the acquisition.For example, in some cases loan files and other information (including servicing records) may be incomplete or inaccurate. If our employees are unable to access customer information easily, or if we are unable to produce originals or copies of documents or accurate information about the loans, collections could be materially and adversely affected, and we may not be able to enforce our right to collect in some cases. Similarly, collections could be affected by any changes to our collection practices, the restructuring of any key servicing functions, transfer of files and other changes that would result from our assumption of the servicing of the acquired portfolios.The anticipated benefits and synergies of our future acquisitions will assume a successful integration, and will be based on projections, which are inherently uncertain, as well as other assumptions. Even if integration is successful, anticipated benefits and synergies may not be achieved.If our estimates of allowance for finance receivable losses are not adequate to absorb actual losses, our provision for finance receivable losses would increase, which would adversely affect our results of operations.We maintain an allowance for finance receivable losses. To estimate the appropriate level of allowance for finance receivable losses, we consider known and relevant internal and external factors that affect finance receivable collectability, including the total amount of finance receivables outstanding, historical finance receivable charge-offs, our current collection patterns, and economic trends. Our methodology for establishing our allowance for finance receivable losses is based on the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 450, Contingencies, and, in part, on our historic loss experience. If customer behavior changes as a result of economic conditions and if we are unable to predict how the unemployment rate, housing price index, and general economic uncertainty may affect our allowance for finance receivable losses, our allowance for finance receivable losses may be inadequate. Our allowance for finance receivable losses is an estimate, and if actual finance receivable losses are materially greater than our allowance for finance receivable losses, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Neither state regulators nor federal regulators regulate our allowance for finance receivable losses.22Table of Contents In June of 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standard Update (""ASU"") 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This ASU significantly changes the way that entities are required to measure credit losses. The new standard requires that the estimated credit loss be based upon an “expected credit loss” approach rather than the “incurred loss” approach. The new approach requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable forecasts of collectability. It is anticipated that the expected credit loss model may require earlier recognition of credit losses than the incurred loss approach. This ASU is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2020. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for more information on this new accounting standard.Our risk management efforts may not be effective.We could incur substantial losses and our business operations could be disrupted if we are unable to effectively identify, manage, monitor, and mitigate financial risks, such as credit risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk, liquidity risk, and other market-related risks, as well as operational risks related to our business, assets and liabilities. To the extent our models used to assess the creditworthiness of potential borrowers do not adequately identify potential risks, the valuations produced would not adequately represent the risk profile of the borrowers and could result in a riskier finance receivables profile than originally identified. Our risk management policies, procedures, and techniques, including our scoring technology, may not be sufficient to identify all of the risks we are exposed to, mitigate the risks we have identified or identify concentrations of risk or additional risks to which we may become subject in the future.Changes in market conditions, including rising interest rates, could adversely affect the rate at which our borrowers prepay their loans and the value of our finance receivables portfolio, as well as increase our financing cost, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Changing market conditions, including but not limited to, changes in interest rates, the availability of credit, the relative economic vitality of the area in which our borrowers and their assets are located, changes in tax laws, other opportunities for investment available to our customers, homeowner mobility, and other economic, social, geographic, demographic, and legal factors beyond our control, may affect the rates at which our borrowers prepay their loans. Generally, in situations where prepayment rates have slowed, the weighted-average life of our finance receivables has increased. Any increase in interest rates may further slow the rate of prepayment for our finance receivables, which could adversely affect our liquidity by reducing the cash flows from, and the value of, the finance receivables we hold for sale or utilize as collateral in our secured funding transactions.Moreover, the vast majority of our finance receivables are fixed-rate finance receivables, which generally decline in value if interest rates increase. As such, if changing market conditions cause interest rates to increase substantially, the value of our fixed-rate finance receivables could decline. Increases in market interest rates could negatively impact our net interest income, as well as our cash flow from operations and results of operations. Because we are subject to applicable legal and regulatory restrictions in certain jurisdictions that limit the maximum interest rate that we may charge on a certain population of our loans, we are limited in our ability to increase the interest rate on our loans to offset any increases in our cost of funds as market interest rates increase. Our yield, as well as our cash flows from operations and results of operations, could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to increase the interest rates charged on newly originated loans to offset any increases in our cost of funds as market interest rates increase. Accordingly, any increase in interest rates could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We may be required to indemnify or repurchase finance receivables from purchasers of finance receivables that we have sold or securitized, or which we will sell or securitize in the future, if our finance receivables fail to meet certain criteria or characteristics or under other circumstances, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.The documents governing our finance receivable sales and securitizations contain provisions that require us to indemnify the purchasers of securitized finance receivables, or to repurchase the affected finance receivables, under certain circumstances. While our sale and securitization documents vary, they generally contain customary provisions that may require us to repurchase finance receivables if:•our representations and warranties concerning the quality and characteristics of the finance receivable are inaccurate;•there is borrower fraud; or•we fail to comply, at the individual finance receivable level or otherwise, with regulatory requirements in connection with the origination and servicing of the finance receivables.23Table of Contents Many purchasers or investors in finance receivables (including through securitizations) are particularly aware of the conditions under which originators must indemnify purchasers or repurchase finance receivables and would benefit from enforcing any repurchase remedies that they may have. At its maximum, our exposure to repurchases or our indemnification obligations under our representations and warranties could include the current unpaid balance of all finance receivables that we have sold or securitized, and which are not subject to settlement agreements with purchasers.The risk of loss on the finance receivables that we have securitized is recognized in our allowance for finance receivable losses since all of our loan securitizations are recorded on our balance sheet. If we are required to indemnify purchasers or repurchase finance receivables that we sell or have sold that result in losses that exceed our reserve for sales recourse or recognize losses on securitized finance receivables that exceed our recorded allowance for finance receivable losses associated with our securitizations, this could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our business and reputation may be materially impacted by information system failures, cyber threats, or network disruptions.Our business relies heavily on information systems to deliver products and services to our customers, and to manage our ongoing operations. These systems may encounter service disruptions due to system, network or software failure, security breaches, computer viruses, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions. In addition, denial-of-service attacks could overwhelm our internet sites and prevent us from adequately serving customers. Cyber threats are constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. We may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities, which may allow them to persist in our system environment over long periods of time. Cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our computer systems and networks and those of our third-party vendors. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and our business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient to adequately address the disruption. A disruption could impair our ability to offer and process our loans, provide customer service, perform collections or other necessary business activities, which could result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. There may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personally identifiable information, that could subject us to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.Our operations rely heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential customer and other information including, among other things, personally identifiable information (“PII”), in our computer systems and networks, as well as those of third parties. Our branch offices and centralized servicing centers, as well as our administrative and executive offices, are part of an electronic information network that is designed to permit us to originate and track finance receivables and collections and perform other tasks that are part of our everyday operations. We devote significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect our computer systems and data. These security measures may not be sufficient and may be vulnerable to hacking, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our computer systems. Any failure, interruption, or breach in our cyber security could result in reputational harm, disruption of our customer relationships, or our inability to originate, process and service our finance receivable products. Further, any of these cyber security and operational risks could expose us to lawsuits by customers for identity theft or other damages resulting from data breach involving PII or misuse of their PII and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, regulators may impose penalties and/or require remedial action if they identify weaknesses in our security systems, and we may be required to incur significant costs to increase our cyber security to address any vulnerabilities that may be discovered or to remediate the harm caused by any security breaches. As part of our business, we may share confidential customer information and proprietary information with customers, vendors, service providers, and business partners. The information systems of these third parties may be vulnerable to security breaches and, despite our best efforts, we may not be able to ensure that these third parties have appropriate security controls in place to protect the information we share with them. If our confidential information is intercepted, stolen, misused, or mishandled while in possession of a third party, it could result in reputational harm to us, loss of customer business, and additional regulatory scrutiny, and it could expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Although we have insurance that is intended to cover certain losses from such events, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate or available.24Table of Contents We are also subject to the theft or misuse of physical customer and employee records at our facilities.Our branch offices and centralized servicing centers have physical customer records necessary for day-to-day operations that contain extensive confidential information about our customers, including financial data and PII. We also retain physical records in various storage locations. The loss or theft of customer information and data from our branch offices, central servicing facilities, or other storage locations could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and penalties and could expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, if we cannot locate original documents (or copies, in some cases) for certain finance receivables, we may not be able to collect on those finance receivables.Certain of our operations rely on external vendors.We rely on third-party vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations. For example, we outsource a portion of our information systems, communication, data management and transaction processing to third parties. Accordingly, we are exposed to the risk that these vendors might not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements or service level agreements because of changes in the vendor’s organizational structure, financial condition, support for existing products and services, or strategic focus. Such failure to perform could be disruptive to our operations, and have a materially adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. These third parties are also sources of risk associated with operational errors, system interruptions or breaches and unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If the vendors encounter any of these issues, we could be exposed to disruption of service, damage to reputation and litigation. Our insurance operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including claims, catastrophic events, underwriting risks and dependence on a primary distribution channel.Insurance claims and policyholder liabilities are difficult to predict and may exceed the related reserves set aside for claims (losses) and associated expenses for claims adjudication (loss adjustment expenses). Additionally, events such as natural disasters, pandemic disease, cyber security breaches and other types of catastrophes, and prolonged economic downturns, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Other risks relating to our insurance operations include changes to laws and regulations applicable to us, as well as changes to the regulatory environment, such as: changes to laws or regulations affecting capital and reserve requirements; frequency and type of regulatory monitoring and reporting; consumer privacy, use of customer data and data security; benefits or loss ratio requirements; insurance producer licensing or appointment requirements; required disclosures to consumers; and collateral protection insurance (i.e., insurance some of our lender companies purchase, at the customer’s expense, on that customer’s loan collateral for the periods of time the customer fails to adequately, as required by the customer's loan, insure the collateral). Because our customers do not directly agree to the amount charged for collateral protection at the time it is purchased, regulators may in the future prohibit our insurance companies from providing this insurance to our lending operations. Moreover, our insurance companies are predominately dependent on our lending operations as the primary source of business and product distribution. If our lending operations discontinue offering insurance products, including as a result of regulatory requirements or rate caps, our insurance operations would need to find an alternate distribution partner for their products, of which there can be no assurance.We are a party to various lawsuits and proceedings and may become a party to various lawsuits and proceedings in the future which, if resolved in a manner adverse to us, could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.In the normal course of business, from time to time, we have been named, and may be named in the future, as a defendant in various legal actions, including governmental investigations, examinations or other proceedings, arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with our business activities. Certain of the legal actions may include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. Some of these proceedings are pending in jurisdictions that permit damage awards disproportionate to the actual economic damages alleged to have been incurred. The continued occurrences of large damage awards in general in the U.S., including large punitive damage awards in certain jurisdictions that bear little or no relation to actual economic damages incurred by plaintiffs, create the potential for an unpredictable result in any given proceeding. A large judgment that is adverse to us could cause our reputation to suffer, encourage additional lawsuits against us and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. For additional information regarding pending legal proceedings and other contingencies, see Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.25Table of Contents Our use of derivatives exposes us to credit and market risks.From time to time, we may enter into derivative financial instruments for economic hedging purposes, such as managing our exposure to interest rate risk. By using derivative instruments, we are exposed to credit and market risks, including the risk of loss associated with variations in the spread between the asset yield and the funding and/or hedge cost, default risk, and the risk of insolvency or other inability of the counterparty to a particular derivative financial instrument to perform its obligations.If we lose the services of any of our key management personnel, our business could suffer.Our future success significantly depends on the continued service and performance of our key management personnel. Competition for these employees is intense and we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel. We do not maintain any “key man” or other related insurance. If we are unable to attract appropriately qualified personnel, we may not be successful in originating loans and servicing our customers, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.Employee misconduct could harm us by subjecting us to monetary loss, significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm.Our reputation is critical to developing and maintaining relationships with our existing and potential customers and third parties with whom we do business. There is a risk that our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. For example, if an employee were to engage—or be accused of engaging—in illegal or suspicious activities including fraud or theft, we could suffer direct losses from the activity, and in addition we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial condition, customer relationships, and ability to attract future customers or employees. Employee misconduct could prompt regulators to allege or to determine, based upon such misconduct, that we have not established adequate supervisory systems and procedures to inform employees of applicable rules or to detect and deter violations of such rules. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent misconduct may not be effective in all cases. Misconduct by our employees, or even unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct, could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business.We may not be able to make technological improvements as quickly as some of our competitors, which could harm our ability to compete and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial and lending institutions to better serve customers and reduce costs. Our future success and, in particular, the success of our centralized operations, will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services as quickly as some of our competitors or be successful in marketing these products and services to our existing and new customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could harm our ability to compete with our competitors and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.As part of our growth strategy, we have committed to building our lending business. If we are unable to successfully implement our strategy, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.We believe that our future success depends on our ability to implement our strategy, the key feature of which has been to shift our primary focus to originating personal loans as well as acquiring portfolios of personal loans, pursuing acquisitions of companies, and/or establishing joint ventures or other strategic alliances. We have also expanded our digital presence in online lending through our centralized operations, which may involve additional risks associated with verifying income and customer identities.26Table of Contents We may not be able to implement our strategy successfully, and our success depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:•address the risks associated with our focus on personal loans (including direct auto loans), including, but not limited to consumer demand and changes in economic conditions and interest rates;•address the risks associated with the new centralized method of originating and servicing our loans online through our centralized operations, which represents a departure from our traditional high-touch branch-based servicing function and includes the potential for higher default and delinquency rates;•integrate, and develop the expertise required to capitalize on, our centralized operations;•obtain regulatory approval in connection with the acquisition of loan portfolios and/or companies in the business of selling loans or related products;•comply with regulations in connection with doing business and offering loan products over the internet, including various state and federal e-signature rules mandating that certain disclosures be made, and certain steps be followed in order to obtain and authenticate e-signatures, with which we have limited experience;•finance future growth; and•successfully source, underwrite and integrate new acquisitions of loan portfolios and other businesses.In order for us to realize the benefits associated with our focus on originating and servicing personal loans and growing our business, we must implement our strategic objectives in a timely and cost-effective manner as well as anticipate and address any potential risks. In any event, we may not realize these benefits for many years, or our competitors may introduce more compelling products, services or enhancements. If we are not able to realize the benefits of our personal loan focus, or if we do not do so in a timely manner, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be negatively affected which would have a material adverse effect on our business.If goodwill and other intangible assets become impaired, it could have a negative impact on our profitability.Goodwill represents the amount of acquisition cost over the fair value of net assets we acquired. If the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Any such adjustments are reflected in our results of operations in the periods in which the impairments become known. There can be no assurance that our future evaluations of goodwill and other intangible assets will not result in findings of impairments and related write-downs, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.We could face environmental liability and costs for damage caused by hazardous waste (including the cost of cleaning up contaminated property) if we foreclose upon or otherwise take title to real estate pledged as collateral.If a real estate loan goes into default, we may start foreclosure proceedings in appropriate circumstances, which could result in our taking title to the mortgaged real estate. We also consider alternatives to foreclosure, such as “short sales,” where we do not take title to mortgaged real estate. There is a risk that toxic or hazardous substances could be found on property after we take title. In addition, we own certain properties through which we operate our business, such as the buildings at our headquarters and certain servicing facilities. As the owner of any property where hazardous waste is present, we could be held liable for clean-up and remediation costs, as well as damages for any personal injuries or property damage caused by the condition of the property. We may also be responsible for these costs if we are in the chain of title for the property, even if we were not responsible for the contamination and even if the contamination is not discovered until after we have sold the property. Costs related to these activities and damages could be substantial. Although we have policies and procedures in place to investigate properties for potential hazardous substances before taking title to properties, these reviews may not always uncover potential environmental hazards.27Table of Contents RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY AND REGULATIONWe operate in a highly competitive market, and we cannot ensure that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.The consumer finance industry is highly competitive. Our profitability depends, in large part, on our ability to underwrite and originate finance receivables. We compete with other consumer finance companies as well as other types of financial institutions that offer similar consumer financial products and services. Some of these competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we possess. Some competitors may also have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that may not be available to us. Banks and credit card companies, which had focused largely on prime customers following the financial crisis, have recently resumed lending to non-prime customers. This shift could increase competition in the markets in which we operate. Increased regulatory pressure on payday lenders could cause many of those lenders to start making more traditional installment consumer loans in order to reduce regulatory scrutiny of their practices. We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our businesses are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business and failure to comply with such regulations may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our businesses are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations, and various state authorities regulate and supervise our insurance operations. The laws under which a substantial amount of our consumer and real estate businesses are conducted generally: provide for state licensing of lenders and, in some cases, licensing of employees involved in real estate loan modifications; impose limits on the terms of consumer credit, including amounts, interest rates and charges; regulate whether and under what circumstances insurance and other optional products may be offered to consumers in connection with a consumer credit transaction; regulate the manner in which we use personal data; and provide for other consumer protections. We are also subject to extensive servicing regulations with which we must comply when servicing our legacy real estate loans and servicing loan portfolios on behalf of other parties. Additionally, we will have to comply with these servicing regulations if we acquire loan portfolios in the future and assume the servicing obligations for the acquired loans or other financial assets. The extent of state regulation of our insurance business varies by product and by jurisdiction, but relates primarily to the following: licensing; conduct of business; periodic examination of the affairs of insurers; form and content of required financial reports; standards of solvency; limitations on dividend payments and other affiliate transactions; types of products offered; approval of policy forms and premium rates; formulas to calculate any unearned premium refund due to an insured customer; permissible investments; deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders; reserve requirements for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes; and claims processing.All of our operations are subject to regular examination by state regulators and, certain aspects of our business, by federal regulators. As a whole, our entities are subject to several hundred regulatory examinations in a given year. These examinations may result in requirements to change our policies or practices, and in some cases, we are required to pay monetary fines or make reimbursements to customers. Many state regulators and some federal regulators have indicated an intention to pool their resources in order to conduct examinations of licensed entities, including us, at the same time (referred to as a “multi-state” examination). This could result in more in-depth examinations, which could be costlier and lead to more significant enforcement actions.We are also subject to potential enforcement, supervisions and other actions that may be brought by state attorneys general or other state enforcement authorities and other governmental agencies. Any such actions could subject us to civil money penalties, customer remediation and increased compliance costs, as well as damage our reputation and brand and could limit or prohibit our ability to offer certain products and services or engage in certain business practices.28Table of Contents State attorneys general have stated their intention to fill any void left by diminished CFPB enforcement and have a variety of tools at their disposal to enforce state and federal consumer financial laws. First, Section 1042 of the Dodd-Frank Act grants state attorneys general the ability to enforce the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act’s authority and to secure remedies provided in the Dodd-Frank Act against entities within their jurisdiction. State attorneys general also have enforcement authority under state law with respect to unfair or deceptive practices. Generally, under these statutes, state attorneys general may conduct investigations, bring actions, and recover civil penalties or obtain injunctive relief against entities engaging in unfair, deceptive, or fraudulent acts. Attorneys general may also coordinate among themselves to enter into multi-state actions or settlements. Then, several consumer financial laws like the Truth in Lending Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act grant enforcement or litigation authority to state attorneys general. Should the CFPB decrease its enforcement activity, we expect to see an increase in actions brought by state attorneys general. The Department of Defense has made changes to the regulations that have been promulgated as a result of the Military Lending Act. Effective October 3, 2016, we are subject to the limitations of the Military Lending Act, which places a 36% “all-in” annual percentage rate limitation on certain fees, charges, interest, and credit and non-credit insurance premiums for non-purchase money loans made to active military service members, their spouses, or covered dependents. We are also no longer able to make non-purchase money loans secured by the titles of motor vehicles to these customers.We are subject to potential changes in federal and state law, which could lower the interest-rate limit that non-depository financial institutions may charge for consumer loans or could expand the definition of interest under federal and state law to include the cost of optional products, such as insurance.We believe that we maintain all material licenses and permits required for our current operations and are in substantial compliance with all applicable federal, state and local regulations, but we may not be able to maintain all requisite licenses and permits, and the failure to satisfy those and other regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, changes in laws or regulations applicable to us could subject us to additional licensing, registration and other regulatory requirements in the future or could adversely affect our ability to operate or the manner in which we conduct business.A material failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in regulatory actions, including substantial fines or penalties, lawsuits and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.For more information with respect to the regulatory framework affecting our businesses, see “Business—Regulation” included in this report.Requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and oversight by the CFPB significantly increase our regulatory costs and burdens.The Dodd-Frank Act was adopted in 2010. This law and the related regulations affect our operations in terms of increased oversight of financial services products by the CFPB, and the imposition of restrictions on the allowable terms for certain consumer credit transactions. The CFPB has significant authority to implement and enforce federal consumer finance laws, including the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act and new requirements for financial services products provided for in the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the authority to identify and prohibit unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provides the CFPB with broad supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over various consumer financial products and services, including the ability to require reimbursements and other payments to customers for alleged legal violations, and to impose significant penalties, as well as injunctive relief that prohibits lenders from engaging in allegedly unlawful practices. Further, state attorneys general and state regulators are authorized to bring civil actions to enforce certain consumer protection provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The industry investigation and enforcement provisions of Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act may adversely affect our business if the CFPB or one or more state attorneys general or state regulators believe that we have violated any federal consumer financial protection laws, including the prohibition in Title X against unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices.29Table of Contents The CFPB currently has supervisory authority over our real estate servicing activities, and may in the future have supervisory authority over at least portions of our consumer lending business. It also has the authority to bring enforcement actions for violations of laws over which it has jurisdiction regardless of whether it has supervisory authority for a given product or service. Effective in January 2014, the CFPB finalized mortgage servicing regulations, which makes it more difficult and expensive to service mortgages. The Dodd-Frank Act also gives the CFPB supervisory authority over entities that are designated as “larger participants” in certain financial services markets. The CFPB has published regulations for “larger participants” in the market of auto finance, and we have been designated as a larger participant in this market. The larger-participant rule for consumer installment loans was one of the rulemaking initiatives the CFPB designated as inactive in its Spring 2018 rulemaking agenda. It is not known if or when the CFPB may consider reactivating the rulemaking process for the larger participant rule for consumer installment loans. The CFPB’s broad supervisory and enforcement powers could affect our business and operations significantly in terms of increased operating and regulatory compliance costs, and limits on the types of products we offer and the manner in which they are offered, among other things. See “Business—Regulation” included in this report for further information on the CFPB.The CFPB and certain state regulators have acted against some lenders regarding, for instance, debt collection and the marketing of optional products offered by the lenders in connection with their loans. The products included debt cancellation/suspension products and other types of payment protection insurance. We collect on delinquent debt. We also sell optional insurance and non-insurance products in connection with our loans. Our debt collection practices and sales of optional insurance and non-insurance products could be challenged in a similar manner by the CFPB or state consumer lending regulators.Some of the rulemaking under the Dodd-Frank Act remains to be done. As a result, the complete impact of the Dodd-Frank Act remains uncertain. The CFPB issued a proposed rule addressing third party debt collection, including communication practices and consumer disclosures, in May 2019. The CFPB also announced that it is considering rulemaking to further clarify the meaning of “abusive” under section 1031 of the Dodd-Frank Act. It is not clear what form these and other remaining regulations will ultimately take, or how our business will be affected. No assurance can be given that the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations or any other new legislative changes enacted will not have a significant impact on our business.For more information with respect to the regulatory framework affecting our businesses, see “Business—Regulation” included in this report.Current and proposed regulations relating to consumer privacy, data protection and information security could increase our costs.We are subject to a number of federal and state consumer privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations. For example, we are subject to the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which governs the use of PII by financial institutions. Moreover, various state laws and regulations may require us to notify customers, employees, state attorneys general, regulators and others in the event of a security breach. Federal and state legislators and regulators are increasingly pursuing new guidance, laws, and regulations relating to consumer privacy, data protection and information security. Compliance with current or future customer privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations could result in higher compliance, technology or other operating costs. Any violations of these laws and regulations may require us to change our business practices or operational structure, and could subject us to material legal claims, monetary penalties, sanctions, and the obligation to compensate and/or notify customers, employees, state attorneys general, regulators and others or take other remedial actions.Our use of third-party vendors is subject to regulatory review.Recently, the CFPB and other regulators have issued regulatory guidance focusing on the need for financial institutions to perform due diligence and ongoing monitoring of third-party vendor relationships which increases the scope of management involvement and decreases the benefit that we receive from using third-party vendors. Moreover, if our regulators conclude that we have not met the standards for oversight of our third-party vendors, we could be subject to enforcement actions, civil monetary penalties, supervisory orders to cease and desist or other remedial actions, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and operating results. Further, federal and state regulators have been scrutinizing the practices of lead aggregators and providers recently.  If regulators place restrictions on certain practices by lead aggregators or providers, our ability to use them as a source for applicants could be affected.30Table of Contents We purchase and sell finance receivables, including charged-off receivables and receivables where the borrower is in default. This practice could subject us to heightened regulatory scrutiny, which may expose us to legal action, cause us to incur losses and/or limit or impede our collection activity.As part of our business model, we purchase and sell finance receivables. Although the borrowers for some of these finance receivables are current on their payments, other borrowers may be in default (including in bankruptcy) or the debt may have been charged off as uncollectible. The CFPB and other regulators have recently significantly increased their scrutiny of the purchase and sale of debt, and collections practices undertaken by purchasers of debt, especially delinquent and charged-off debt. The CFPB has scrutinized sellers of debt for not maintaining sufficient documentation to support and verify the validity or amount of the debt. It has also scrutinized debt collectors for, among other things, their collection tactics, attempting to collect debts that no longer are valid, misrepresenting the amount of the debt and not having sufficient documentation to verify the validity or amount of the debt. Our purchases or sales of receivables could expose us to lawsuits or fines by regulators if we do not have sufficient documentation to support and verify the validity and amount of the finance receivables underlying these transactions, or if we or purchasers of our finance receivables use collection methods that are viewed as unfair or abusive. In addition, our collections could suffer, and we may incur additional expenses if we are required to change collection practices or stop collecting on certain debts as a result of a lawsuit or action on the part of regulators.Changes in law and regulatory developments could result in significant additional compliance costs relating to securitizations.The Dodd-Frank Act and related rulemaking and regulatory developments has resulted, and will continue to result, in the incurrence of additional compliance costs in connection with securitization transactions. The Dodd-Frank Act requires, among other things, that a securitizer retain at least a 5% economic interest in the credit risk of the securitized assets; this requirement has reduced and will continue to reduce the amount of financing obtained from such transactions. Furthermore, sponsors are prohibited from diluting the required risk retention by dividing the economic interest among multiple parties or hedging or transferring the credit risk the sponsor is required to maintain. Moreover, the SEC’s significant changes to Regulation AB could result in sweeping changes to the commercial and residential mortgage loan securitization markets, as well as to the market for the re-securitization of mortgage-backed securities.Rules relating to securitizations rated by nationally-recognized statistical rating agencies require that the findings of any third-party due diligence service providers be made publicly available at least five (5) business days prior to the first sale of securities, which has led and will continue to lead us to incur additional costs in connection with each securitization.Investment Company Act considerations could affect our method of doing business.We intend to continue conducting our business operations so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”). We are a holding company that conducts its businesses primarily through wholly-owned subsidiaries and are not an investment company because our subsidiaries are primarily engaged in the non-investment company business of consumer finance. Certain of our subsidiaries rely on exemptions from registration as an investment company, including pursuant to Sections 3(c)(4) and 3(c)(5) of the Investment Company Act. We rely on guidance published by the SEC staff or on our analyses of such guidance to determine our subsidiaries’ qualification under these and other exemptions. To the extent that the SEC staff publishes new or different guidance with respect to these matters, we may be required to adjust our business operations accordingly. Any additional guidance from the SEC staff could provide additional flexibility to us, or it could inhibit our ability to conduct our business operations. There can be no assurance that the laws and regulations governing the Investment Company Act status of real estate or real estate related assets or SEC guidance regarding Investment Company Act exemptions for real estate assets will not change in a manner that adversely affects our operations. If we fail to qualify for an exemption or exception from the Investment Company Act in the future, we could be required to restructure our activities or the activities of our subsidiaries, which could negatively affect us. In addition, if we or one or more of our subsidiaries fail to maintain compliance with the applicable exemptions or exceptions and we do not have another basis available to us on which we may avoid registration, and we were therefore required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we would become subject to substantial regulation with respect to our capital structure, management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons, holdings, and other matters, which could have an adverse effect on us.31Table of Contents RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESSAn inability to access adequate sources of liquidity may adversely affect our ability to fund operational requirements and satisfy financial obligations.Our ability to access capital and credit may be significantly affected by disruption in the U.S. credit markets and the associated credit rating downgrades on our debt. In addition, the risk of volatility surrounding the global economic system and uncertainty surrounding regulatory reforms, such as the Dodd-Frank Act, continue to create uncertainty around access to the capital markets. Historically, we have funded our operations and repaid our debt and other obligations using funds collected from our finance receivable portfolio and new debt issuances. Our current corporate credit ratings are below investment grade and, as a result, our borrowing costs may further increase and our ability to borrow may be limited. In addition to issuing unsecured debt in the public and private markets, we have raised capital through securitization transactions and, although there can be no assurances that we will be able to complete additional securitizations or issue additional unsecured debt, we currently expect our near-term sources of capital markets funding to continue to derive from securitization transactions and unsecured debt offerings.Any future capital markets transactions will be dependent on our financial performance as well as market conditions, which may result in receiving financing on terms less favorable to us than our existing financings. In addition, our access to future financing and our ability to refinance existing debt will depend on a variety of factors such as our financial performance, the general availability of credit, our credit ratings and credit capacity at the time we pursue such financing.If we are unable to complete additional securitization transactions or unsecured debt offerings on a timely basis or upon terms acceptable to us or otherwise access adequate sources of liquidity, our ability to fund our own operational requirements and satisfy financial obligations may be adversely affected.Our indebtedness is significant, which could affect our ability to meet our obligations under our debt instruments and could materially and adversely affect our business and ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry.Our significant indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:•it may require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of the principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, which reduces the funds available for other purposes, including finance receivable originations and capital returns;•it could limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing regulatory, business and economic conditions;•it may limit our ability to incur additional borrowings or securitizations for working capital, capital expenditures, business development, debt service requirements, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes, or to refinance our indebtedness;•it may require us to seek to change the maturity, interest rate and other terms of our existing debt;•it may place us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors that are not as highly leveraged;•it may cause a downgrade of our debt and long-term corporate ratings; and•it may cause us to be more vulnerable to periods of negative or slow growth in the general economy or in our business.In addition, meeting our anticipated liquidity requirements is contingent upon our continued compliance with our existing debt agreements. An event of default or declaration of acceleration under one of our existing debt agreements could also result in an event of default and declaration of acceleration under certain of our other existing debt agreements. Such an acceleration of our debt would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to continue as a going concern. If our debt obligations increase, whether due to the increased cost of existing indebtedness or the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the consequences described above could be magnified.There can be no assurance that we will be able to repay or refinance our debt in the future.32Table of Contents Certain of our outstanding notes contain covenants that restrict our operations and may inhibit our ability to grow our business and increase revenues.SFC’s indenture and certain of SFC’s notes contain a covenant that limits SFC’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to create or incur liens. The restrictions may interfere with our ability to obtain new or additional financing or may affect the manner in which we structure such new or additional financing or engage in other business activities, which may significantly limit or harm our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. A default and resulting acceleration of obligations could also result in an event of default and declaration of acceleration under certain of our other existing debt agreements. Such an acceleration of our debt would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to continue as a going concern. A default could also significantly limit our alternatives to refinance the debt under which the default occurred as well as other indebtedness. This limitation may significantly restrict our financing options during times of either market distress or our financial distress, which are precisely the times when having financing options is most important.The assessment of our liquidity is based upon significant judgments and estimates that could prove to be materially incorrect.In assessing our current financial position and developing operating plans for the future, management has made significant judgments and estimates with respect to our liquidity, including but not limited to:•our ability to generate sufficient cash to service all of our outstanding debt;•our continued ability to access debt and securitization markets and other sources of funding on favorable terms;•our ability to complete on favorable terms, as needed, additional borrowings, securitizations, finance receivable portfolio sales, or other transactions to support liquidity, and the costs associated with these funding sources, including sales at less than carrying value and limits on the types of assets that can be securitized or sold, which would affect our profitability;•the potential for downgrade of our debt by rating agencies, which would have a negative impact on our cost of, and access to, capital;•our ability to comply with our debt covenants;•our ability to make capital returns to OMH's stockholders;•the amount of cash expected to be received from our finance receivable portfolio through collections (including prepayments) and receipt of finance charges, which could be materially different than our estimates;•the potential for declining financial flexibility and reduced income should we use more of our assets for securitizations and finance receivable portfolio sales; and•the potential for reduced income due to the possible deterioration of the credit quality of our finance receivable portfolios.Additionally, there are numerous risks to our financial results, liquidity, and capital raising and debt refinancing plans that are not quantified in our current liquidity forecasts. These risks include, but are not limited, to the following:•our inability to grow our personal loan portfolio with adequate profitability to fund operations, loan losses, and other expenses;•our inability to monetize assets including, but not limited to, our access to debt and securitization markets;•our inability to obtain the additional necessary funding to finance our operations;•the effect of current and potential new federal, state and local laws, regulations, or regulatory policies and practices, including the Dodd-Frank Act, on our ability to conduct business or the manner in which we conduct business, such as licensing requirements, pricing limitations or restrictions on the method of offering products, as well as changes that may result from increased regulatory scrutiny of the sub-prime lending industry;•potential liability relating to real estate and personal loans which we have sold or may sell in the future, or relating to securitized loans, if it is determined that there was a non-curable breach of a warranty made in connection with the transaction;•the potential for increasing costs and difficulty in servicing our loan portfolio as a result of heightened nationwide regulatory scrutiny of loan servicing and foreclosure practices in the industry generally, and related costs that could be passed on to us in connection with the subservicing of our real estate loans that were originated or acquired centrally;•reduced cash flows as a result of the liquidation of our real estate loan portfolio;•the potential for additional unforeseen cash demands or acceleration of obligations;33Table of Contents •reduced income due to loan modifications where the borrower’s interest rate is reduced, principal payments are deferred, or other concessions are made;•the potential for declines or volatility in bond and equity markets; and•the potential effect on us if the capital levels of our regulated and unregulated subsidiaries prove inadequate to support our current business plans.We intend to repay indebtedness with one or more of the following sources, among others: finance receivable collections, cash on hand, proceeds of additional debt financings (particularly new securitizations and possible new issuances and/or debt refinancing transactions), finance receivable portfolio sales, or a combination of the foregoing. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in undertaking any of these activities to support our operations and repay our obligations.The actual outcome of one or more of our plans could be materially different than expected or one or more of our significant judgments or estimates about the potential effects of these risks and uncertainties could prove to be materially incorrect. In the event of such an occurrence, if third-party financing is not available, our liquidity could be materially adversely affected, and as a result, substantial doubt could exist about our ability to continue as a going concern.SFC's credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to raise capital in the debt markets at attractive rates, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.S&P, Moody’s, and KBRA rate SFC’s debt. Ratings reflect the rating agencies’ opinions of a company’s financial strength, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating.The table below outlines SFC’s long-term corporate debt ratings and outlook by rating agencies:As of December 31, 2019RatingOutlookS&PBB-  Stable  Moody’sBa3  Stable  KBRABB+  Stable  Currently, no other entity has a corporate debt rating, though they may be rated in the future. If SFC’s current ratings are downgraded, it will likely increase the interest rate that we would have to pay to raise money in the capital markets, making it more expensive for us to borrow money and adversely impacting our access to capital. As a result, a downgrade of SFC's ratings could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.34Table of Contents Our securitizations may expose us to financing and other risks, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to access the securitization market in the future, which may require us to seek more costly financing.We have securitized, and may in the future securitize, certain of our finance receivables to generate cash to originate or purchase new finance receivables or repay our outstanding indebtedness. In such transactions, we typically convey a pool of finance receivables to a special purpose entity, which, in turn, conveys the finance receivables to a trust (the issuing entity). Concurrently, the trust typically issues non-recourse notes or certificates pursuant to the terms of an indenture or pooling and servicing agreement, which then are transferred to the special purpose entity in exchange for the finance receivables. The securities issued by the trust are secured by the pool of finance receivables. In exchange for the transfer of finance receivables to the issuing entity, we typically receive the cash proceeds from the sale of the trust securities, all residual interests, if any, in the cash flows from the finance receivables after payment of the trust securities, and a 100% beneficial interest in the issuing entity.Although we have successfully completed a number of securitizations since 2012, we can give no assurances that we will be able to complete additional securitizations if the securitization markets become constrained. In addition, the value of any subordinated securities that we may retain in our securitizations might be reduced or, in some cases, eliminated as a result of an adverse change in economic conditions or the financial markets.SFC, OMFG, and OMFH currently act as the servicers with respect to the personal loan securitization trusts and related series of asset-backed securities. If SFC, OMFG, or OMFH defaults in its servicing obligations, an early amortization event could occur with respect to the relevant asset-backed securities and SFC, OMFG, or OMFH, as applicable, could be replaced as servicer. Servicer defaults include, for example, the failure of the servicer to make any payment, transfer or deposit in accordance with the securitization documents, a breach of representations, warranties or agreements made by the servicer under the securitization documents and the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the servicer. Such an early amortization event could damage our reputation and have materially adverse consequences on our liquidity and cost of funds.Rating agencies may also affect our ability to execute a securitization transaction or increase the costs we expect to incur from executing securitization transactions, not only by deciding not to issue ratings for our securitization transactions, but also by altering the criteria and process they follow in issuing ratings. Rating agencies could alter their ratings processes or criteria after we have accumulated finance receivables for securitization in a manner that effectively reduces the value of those finance receivables by increasing our financing costs or otherwise requiring that we incur additional costs to comply with those processes and criteria. We have no ability to control or predict what actions the rating agencies may take in this regard.Further, other matters, such as (i) accounting standards applicable to securitization transactions and (ii) capital and leverage requirements applicable to banks and other regulated financial institutions' asset-backed securities, could result in decreased investor demand for securities issued through our securitization transactions, or increased competition from other institutions that undertake securitization transactions. In addition, compliance with certain regulatory requirements, including the Dodd-Frank Act and the Investment Company Act, may affect the type of securitizations that we are able to complete.If it is not possible or economical for us to securitize our finance receivables in the future, we would need to seek alternative financing to support our operations and to meet our existing debt obligations, which may be less efficient and more expensive than raising capital via securitizations and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.35Table of Contents RISKS RELATED TO OUR ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTUREThe Apollo-Värde Group is OMH's largest stockholder, and the Apollo-Värde Group may exercise significant influence over us, including through its ability to designate a majority of the members of the board of directors, and its interests may conflict with the interests of OMH's other stockholders.Effective June 25, 2018, OMH Holdings, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, an entity formed by the Apollo-Värde Group, an investor group led by funds managed by Apollo and Värde, completed its purchase of 54,937,500 shares of OMH's common stock formerly beneficially owned by Springleaf Financial Holdings, LLC, an entity owned primarily by a private equity fund managed by an affiliate of Fortress. The Apollo-Värde Group's holdings represent approximately 40.4% of OMH's outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2019. As a result, the Apollo-Värde Group is OMH's largest stockholder and has significant influence on all matters requiring a stockholder vote, including the election of its directors; mergers, consolidations and acquisitions; the sale of all or substantially all of OMH's assets and other decisions affecting its capital structure; the amendment of OMH's restated certificate of incorporation and its amended and restated bylaws; and its winding up and dissolution. This concentration of ownership may delay, deter or prevent acts that would be favored by OMH's other stockholders, including delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of OMH or a merger, takeover or other business combination that may be otherwise favorable to us or OMH's other stockholders. As a result, the market price of OMH's common stock could decline, or stockholders might not receive a premium over the then-current market price of OMH's common stock upon a change in control. In addition, this concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of OMH's common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in a company with a significant stockholder. See additional information under “Business Overview” in Item 1 of this report.In connection with the closing of the Apollo-Värde Transaction, OMH entered into an Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement, which provides the Apollo-Värde Group with the right to designate a majority of the members of the board of directors, plus one director, for so long as the Apollo-Värde Group and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees continue to beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least 33% of OMH's issued and outstanding common stock. With such representation on the board of directors, the Apollo-Värde Group will be able to exercise significant influence over decisions affecting OMH, including its direction and policies, the appointment of management and any action requiring the vote of its board of directors, including significant corporate action such as mergers and sales of substantially all of its assets and decisions affecting its capital structure. The interests of the Apollo-Värde Group may not always coincide with OMH's interests or the interests of OMH's other stockholders. The Apollo-Värde Group may seek to cause OMH to take courses of action that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment in OMH, but which might involve risks or adversely affect OMH or its other stockholders. The terms of the Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement are further described in OMH's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 25, 2018. The Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to that Current Report on Form 8-K, and such Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 10.1 thereto, is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.In addition, the Apollo-Värde Group and its affiliates may conduct business with any business that is competitive or in the same line of business as us, do business with any of our clients, customers or vendors, make investments in the kind of property in which we may make investments or acquire the same or similar types of assets that we may seek to acquire. Affiliates of the Apollo-Värde Group are in the business of making or advising on investments in companies and may hold, and from time to time in the future may acquire, interests in or provide advice to businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or are vendors or customers of ours. The Apollo-Värde Group may also pursue acquisitions that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.OMH and SFC are holding companies with no operations and rely on our operating subsidiaries to provide us with funds necessary to meet our financial obligations and enable us to pay dividends.OMH and SFC are holding companies with no material direct operations. Our principal assets are the equity interests we directly or indirectly hold in our operating subsidiaries, which own our operating assets. As a result, we are dependent on loans, dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations and enable OMH to pay dividends on its common stock. Our subsidiaries are legally distinct from us and certain of our subsidiaries are prohibited or restricted from paying dividends or otherwise making funds available to us under certain conditions. For example, our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit their ability to pay dividends or make loans or advances to us, principally to protect policyholders, and certain of SFC's debt agreements limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. If we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries, or if our subsidiaries do not generate sufficient cash from operations, we may be unable to meet our financial obligations or pay dividends, and the board may exercise its discretion not to pay dividends.36Table of Contents OMH may not pay dividends on its common stock in the future, even if liquidity and leverage targets are met.While OMH intends to pay regular quarterly dividends for the foreseeable future, and has announced an intention to pay semi-annual special dividends, all subsequent dividends will be reviewed quarterly and declared at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on many factors. As a result, OMH cannot provide any assurance that it will continue to pay dividends on its common stock in future periods, even if liquidity and target leverage objectives are met. See our “Dividend Policy” in Part II - Item 5 of this report for further information. Certain provisions of an amended and restated stockholders agreement with the Apollo-Värde Group, restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could hinder, delay or prevent a change in control of OMH, which could adversely affect the price of OMH's common stock.Certain provisions of the Stockholders Agreement, OMH's restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of the board of directors or the Apollo-Värde Group. These provisions provide for:•a classified board of directors consisting of nine members with staggered three-year terms;•certain rights to the Apollo-Värde Group and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees with respect to the designation of directors for nomination and election to the board of directors, including the ability to appoint a majority of the members of the board of directors, plus one director, for so long as the Apollo-Värde Group and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees continue to beneficially own, directly or indirectly at least 33% of OMH's issued and outstanding common stock;•removal of directors only for cause and only with the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the voting interest of stockholders entitled to vote (provided, however, that for so long as the Apollo-Värde Group and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least 30% of OMH's issued and outstanding common stock, directors may be removed with or without cause with the affirmative vote of a majority of the then issued and outstanding voting interest of stockholders entitled to vote);•no ability for stockholders to call special meetings of OMH's stockholders (provided, however, that for so long as the Apollo-Värde Group and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least 20% of OMH's issued and outstanding common stock, any stockholders that collectively beneficially own at least 20% of OMH's issued and outstanding common stock may call special meetings of our stockholders);•advance notice requirements by stockholders with respect to director nominations and actions to be taken at annual meetings;•no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which means that the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of OMH's common stock can elect all the directors standing for election;•the ability for stockholders to act outside a meeting by written consent only if unanimous, provided, however, that for so long as the Apollo-Värde Group and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least 20% of OMH's issued and outstanding common stock, OMH's stockholders may act without a meeting by written consent of a majority of OMH's stockholders; and•the issuance of blank check preferred stock by the board of directors from time to time in one or more series and to establish the terms, preferences and rights of any such series of preferred stock, all without approval of OMH stockholders. Nothing in OMH's restated certificate of incorporation precludes future issuances without stockholder approval of the authorized but unissued shares of OMH's common stock.In addition, these provisions may make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a tender offer, change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by the Apollo-Värde Group, our management or the board of directors. Public stockholders who might desire to participate in these types of transactions may not have an opportunity to do so, even if the transaction is favorable to stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to benefit from a change in control or change our management and board of directors and, as a result, may adversely affect the market price of OMH's common stock and the ability of public stockholders to realize any potential change of control premium.See additional information under “Business Overview” in Item 1 of this report. The terms of the Amended and Restated Stockholders’ Agreement are described in OMH's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 25, 2018, and such Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. 37Table of Contents Certain OMH's stockholders have the right to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses as us.The Apollo-Värde Group and its affiliates engage in other investments and business activities in addition to their ownership of OMH. Under OMH's restated certificate of incorporation, the Apollo-Värde Group and its affiliates have the right, and have no duty to abstain from exercising such right, to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses as us, do business with any of our clients, customers or vendors or employ or otherwise engage any of our officers, directors or employees. If the Apollo-Värde Group and its affiliates, or any of their respective officers, directors or employees acquire knowledge of a potential transaction that could be a corporate opportunity, they have no duty, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to offer such corporate opportunity to us, OMH's stockholders or our affiliates.In the event that any of our directors and officers who is also a director, officer or employee of any of the Apollo-Värde Group or its affiliates acquires knowledge of a corporate opportunity or is offered a corporate opportunity, provided that this knowledge was not acquired solely in such person’s capacity as our director or officer and such person acts in good faith, then even if the Apollo-Värde Group or its affiliates pursues or acquires the corporate opportunity or if the Apollo-Värde Group  or its affiliates do not present the corporate opportunity to us, such person is deemed to have fully satisfied such person’s fiduciary duties owed to us and is not liable to us.Licensing and insurance laws and regulations may delay or impede purchases of OMH's common stock.Certain of the states in which we are licensed to originate loans and the state in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled (Texas) have laws and regulations which require regulatory approval for the acquisition of “control” of regulated entities. In addition, the Texas insurance laws and regulations generally provide that no person may acquire control, directly or indirectly, of a domiciled insurer, unless the person has provided the required information to, and the acquisition is subsequently approved or not disapproved by the Department of Insurance (""DOI""). Under state insurance laws or regulations, there exists a presumption of “control” when an acquiring party acquires as little as 10% of the voting securities of a regulated entity or of a company which itself controls (directly or indirectly) a regulated entity (the threshold is 10% under the insurance statute of Texas). Therefore, any person acquiring 10% or more of OMH's common stock may need the prior approval of the Texas insurance and/or licensing regulators, or a determination from such regulators that “control” has not been acquired, which could significantly delay or otherwise impede their ability to complete such purchase. RISKS RELATED TO FINANCIAL REPORTINGFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that we timely report information as specified in the rules and regulations of the SEC. We also maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable reports and prevent fraud.We believe that a control system, no matter how well designed and managed, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. We may not be able to identify all significant deficiencies and/or material weaknesses in our internal controls in the future, and our failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.38Table of Contents Our valuations may include methodologies, models, estimations and assumptions which are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to financial assets and liabilities that may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.The allowance for finance receivable losses is a critical accounting estimate which requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions to determine the appropriate level of allowance. We estimate the allowance for finance receivable losses primarily on historical loss experience using a roll rate-based model applied to our finance receivable portfolio. We adjust the amounts determined by the roll rate-based model for management’s estimate of the effects of model imprecision which include any changes to underwriting criteria, portfolio seasoning, and current economic conditions, including levels of unemployment and personal bankruptcies. If we are unable to predict certain of these assumptions accurately, our allowance for finance receivable losses may be inadequate. If actual finance receivable losses are materially greater than our allowance for finance receivable losses, our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be adversely affected.We use estimates, assumptions, and judgments when certain financial assets and liabilities are measured and reported at fair value. Fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on quoted market prices and/or other observable inputs provided by independent third-party sources, when available.  During periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain assets if trading becomes less frequent or market data becomes less observable. In such cases, certain asset valuations may require significant judgment, and may include inputs and assumptions that require greater estimation, including credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and other relevant inputs. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.RISKS RELATED TO OMH'S COMMON STOCKThe market price and trading volume of OMH's common stock may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for OMH's stockholders.The market price of OMH's common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume in OMH's common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. If the market price of OMH's common stock declines significantly, public stockholders may be unable to resell their shares at or above their purchase price, if at all. The market price of OMH's common stock may fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of OMH's common stock include:•variations in our quarterly or annual operating results;•changes in our earnings estimates (if provided) or differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts;•the contents of published research reports about us or our industry or the failure of securities analysts to cover OMH's common stock in the future;•additions to, or departures of, key management personnel;•any increased indebtedness we may incur in the future;•announcements by us or others and developments affecting us;•actions by institutional stockholders or the Apollo-Värde Group;•litigation and governmental investigations;•changes in market valuations of similar companies;•speculation or reports by the press or investment community with respect to us or our industry in general;•increases in market interest rates that may lead purchasers of OMH's shares to demand a higher yield;•announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments; and•general market, political and economic conditions, including any such conditions and local conditions in the markets in which our borrowers are located.39Table of Contents These broad company, market and industry factors may decrease the market price of OMH's common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The stock market in general has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.Future offerings of debt or equity securities by us may adversely affect the market price of OMH's common stock.In the future, we may attempt to obtain financing or to further increase our capital resources by issuing additional shares of OMH's common stock or offering debt or other equity securities, including commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior or subordinated notes, debt securities convertible into equity or shares of preferred stock. In particular, we intend to continue to seek opportunities to acquire consumer finance portfolios and/or businesses that engage in consumer finance loan servicing and/or consumer finance loan originations. Future acquisitions could require substantial additional capital in excess of cash from operations. We would expect to finance the capital required for acquisitions through a combination of additional issuances of equity, corporate indebtedness, asset-backed acquisition financing and/or cash from operations.Issuing additional shares of OMH's common stock or other equity securities or securities convertible into equity may dilute the economic and voting rights of OMH's stockholders at the time of such issuance or reduce the market price of OMH's common stock or both. Upon liquidation, holders of debt securities and preferred shares, if issued, and lenders with respect to other borrowings would receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of OMH's common stock. Debt securities convertible into equity could be subject to adjustments in the conversion ratio pursuant to which certain events may increase the number of equity securities issuable upon conversion. Preferred shares, if issued, could have a preference with respect to liquidating distributions or a preference with respect to dividend payments that could limit our ability to pay dividends to the holders of OMH's common stock. Our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of OMH's common stock bear the risk that our future offerings may reduce the market price of OMH's common stock and dilute their stockholdings in us.The market price of OMH's common stock could be negatively affected by sales of substantial amounts of OMH's common stock in the public markets. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 40.4% of OMH's outstanding common stock was held by the Apollo-Värde Group and, subject to certain restrictions set forth in an amended and restated stockholders agreement, can be resold into the public markets in the future in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act. A decline in the price of OMH's common stock, whether as a result of sale of stock by the Apollo-Värde Group or otherwise, might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional common stock or other equity securities.The future issuance of additional common stock in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions or otherwise will dilute all other stockholdings.OMH has an aggregate of 1,863,805,538 shares of common stock authorized but unissued as of January 31, 2020. OMH may issue all of these shares of common stock without any action or approval by OMH's stockholders, subject to certain exceptions. OMH also intends to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and may issue common stock in connection with these acquisitions. Any common stock issued in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions, the exercise of outstanding stock options or otherwise would dilute the percentage ownership held by existing OMH's stockholders"
7,OMF,ONEMAIN HOLDINGS INC,2019-02-15,"Risk Factors
.We face a variety of risks that are inherent in our business. Accordingly, you should carefully consider the following discussion of risks of which we are currently aware that could affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition.  In addition to the factors discussed in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC that could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition, new risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our business or financial performance. Therefore, the risk factors below should not be considered a complete list of potential risks that we may face.Any risk factor described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any of our other SEC filings could by itself, or together with other factors, materially adversely affect our liquidity, competitive position, business, reputation, results of operations or financial condition, including by materially increasing our expenses or decreasing our revenues, which could result in material losses.RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSOur consolidated results of operations and financial condition and our borrowers’ ability to make payments on their loans have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by economic conditions and other factors that we cannot control.Uncertainty and negative trends in general economic conditions in the United States and abroad, including significant tightening of credit markets and a general decline in the value of real property, historically have created a difficult operating environment for our businesses and other companies in our industries. Many factors, including factors that are beyond our control, may impact our consolidated results of operations or financial condition and/or affect our borrowers’ willingness or capacity to make payments on their loans. These factors include: unemployment levels, housing markets, energy costs and interest rates; events such as natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, catastrophes; events that affect our borrowers, such as major medical expenses, divorce or death; and the quality of any collateral underlying our receivables. If we experience an economic downturn or if the U.S. economy is unable to continue or sustain its recovery from the most recent economic downturn, or if we become affected by other events beyond our control, we may experience a significant reduction in revenues, earnings and cash flows, difficulties accessing capital and a deterioration in the value of our investments. We may also become exposed to increased credit risk from our customers and third parties who have obligations to us.Moreover, our customers are primarily non-prime borrowers. Non-prime borrowers have historically been, and may in the future become, more likely to be affected, or more severely affected, by adverse macroeconomic conditions than prime borrowers. If a borrower defaults under a finance receivable held directly by us, we will bear a risk of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral, if any, and the outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest on the finance receivable, which could adversely affect our cash flows from operations. In addition, foreclosure of a real estate loan (part of our legacy real estate loan portfolio) is an expensive and lengthy process that can negatively affect our anticipated return on the foreclosed loan. The cost to service our loans may also increase without a corresponding increase in our finance charge income.Also, certain geographic concentrations of our loan portfolio may occur or increase as we adjust our risk and loss tolerance and strategy to achieve our profitability goals. Any geographic concentration may expose us to an increased risk of loss if that geographic region experiences higher unemployment rates than average, natural disasters, weak economic conditions, or other adverse economic factors that disproportionately affect that region. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for quantification of our largest concentrations of net finance receivables.If aspects of our business, including the quality of our finance receivables portfolio or our borrowers, are significantly affected by economic changes or any other conditions in the future, we cannot be certain that our policies and procedures for underwriting, processing and servicing loans will adequately adapt to such changes. If we fail to adapt to changing economic conditions or other factors, or if such changes adversely affect our borrowers’ willingness or capacity to repay their loans, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity would be materially adversely affected. 19Table of Contents  There are risks associated with the acquisition or sale of assets or businesses and the formation, termination or operation of joint ventures or other strategic alliances, including the possibility of increased delinquencies and losses, difficulties with integrating loans into our servicing platform and disruption to our ongoing business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We have previously acquired, and in the future may acquire, assets or businesses, including large portfolios of finance receivables, either through the direct purchase of such assets or the purchase of the equity of a company with such a portfolio. Since we will not have originated or serviced the loans we acquire, we may not be aware of legal or other deficiencies related to origination or servicing, and our review of the portfolio prior to purchase may not uncover those deficiencies. Further, we may have limited recourse against the seller of the portfolio.The ability to integrate and successfully service newly acquired loan portfolios will depend in large part on the success of our development and integration of expanded servicing capabilities, including additional personnel. We may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction if the integration process takes longer, or is costlier, than expected. Our failure to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating the acquired portfolios with our current business or otherwise to realize any of the anticipated benefits of the transaction could impair our operations. In addition, the integration of future large portfolio or other asset or business acquisitions and the formation, termination or operation of joint ventures or other strategic alliances are complex, time-consuming and expensive processes that, without proper planning and effective and timely implementation, could significantly disrupt our business.Potential difficulties we may encounter in connection with these transactions and arrangements include, but are not limited to, the following:•the integration of the assets or business into our information technology platforms and servicing systems;•the quality of servicing during any interim servicing period after we purchase a portfolio but before we assume servicing obligations from the seller or its agents;•the disruption to our ongoing businesses and distraction of our management teams from ongoing business concerns;•incomplete or inaccurate files and records;•the retention of existing customers;•the creation of uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems;•the occurrence of unanticipated expenses; and•potential unknown liabilities associated with the transactions, including legal liability related to origination and servicing prior to the acquisition.For example, in some cases loan files and other information (including servicing records) may be incomplete or inaccurate. If our employees are unable to access customer information easily, or if we are unable to produce originals or copies of documents or accurate information about the loans, collections could be affected significantly, and we may not be able to enforce our right to collect in some cases. Similarly, collections could be affected by any changes to our collection practices, the restructuring of any key servicing functions, transfer of files and other changes that would result from our assumption of the servicing of the acquired portfolios.The anticipated benefits and synergies of our future acquisitions will assume a successful integration, and will be based on projections, which are inherently uncertain, as well as other assumptions. Even if integration is successful, anticipated benefits and synergies may not be achieved.Our strategy of increasing the proportion of secured loan originations within our loan portfolio may lead to declines in, or slower growth than anticipated, of our personal loan net finance receivables and yield, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and growth prospects.Secured loans typically carry lower yields relative to unsecured personal loans. If we are unable to successfully convert lower credit tier customers to our secured loan products or otherwise increase new originations of secured personal loans, this will adversely affect our ability to grow personal loan net finance receivables. In addition, as secured loans continue to represent a larger proportion of our loan portfolio, our yields may be lower than our yields in prior periods. 20Table of Contents  If our estimates of allowance for finance receivable losses are not adequate to absorb actual losses, our provision for finance receivable losses would increase, which would adversely affect our results of operations.We maintain an allowance for finance receivable losses. To estimate the appropriate level of allowance for finance receivable losses, we consider known and relevant internal and external factors that affect finance receivable collectability, including the total amount of finance receivables outstanding, historical finance receivable charge-offs, our current collection patterns, and economic trends. Our methodology for establishing our allowance for finance receivable losses is based on the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 450, Contingencies, and, in part, on our historic loss experience. If customer behavior changes as a result of economic conditions and if we are unable to predict how the unemployment rate, housing foreclosures, and general economic uncertainty may affect our allowance for finance receivable losses, our allowance for finance receivable losses may be inadequate. Our allowance for finance receivable losses is an estimate, and if actual finance receivable losses are materially greater than our allowance for finance receivable losses, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Neither state regulators nor federal regulators regulate our allowance for finance receivable losses.In June of 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standard Update ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This ASU significantly changes the way that entities will be required to measure credit losses. The new standard requires that the estimated credit loss be based upon an “expected credit loss” approach rather than the “incurred loss” approach currently required. The new approach will require entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable forecasts of collectability. It is anticipated that the expected credit loss model may require earlier recognition of credit losses than the incurred loss approach. This ASU will become effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2020. We believe the adoption of this ASU will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements through an increase to the allowance for finance receivable losses, an increase to deferred tax assets and a corresponding one-time cumulative reduction to retained earnings, net of tax, in the consolidated balance sheet as of the beginning of the year of adoption. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for more information on this new accounting standard.Our risk management efforts may not be effective.We could incur substantial losses and our business operations could be disrupted if we are unable to effectively identify, manage, monitor, and mitigate financial risks, such as credit risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk, liquidity risk, and other market-related risks, as well as operational risks related to our business, assets and liabilities. To the extent our models used to assess the creditworthiness of potential borrowers do not adequately identify potential risks, the valuations produced would not adequately represent the risk profile of the borrowers and could result in a riskier finance receivables profile than originally identified. Our risk management policies, procedures, and techniques, including our scoring technology, may not be sufficient to identify all of the risks we are exposed to, mitigate the risks we have identified or identify concentrations of risk or additional risks to which we may become subject in the future.Our branch loan approval process is decentralized, which may result in variability of loan structures, and could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our branch finance receivable origination process is decentralized. We train our employees to make loans that conform to our underwriting standards. Such training includes critical aspects of state and federal regulatory compliance, cash handling, account management and customer relations. In certain circumstances, subject to approval by district managers and/or directors of operations in certain cases, our branch officers have some authority to approve and structure loans within broadly written underwriting guidelines rather than having all loan terms approved centrally. As a result, there may be variability in finance receivable structure (e.g., whether or not collateral is taken for the loan) and loan portfolios among branch offices or regions, even when underwriting policies are followed. Moreover, we cannot be certain that every loan is made in accordance with our underwriting standards and rules, and we have in the past experienced some instances of loans extended that varied from our underwriting standards. The nature of our approval process could adversely affect our operating results and variances in underwriting standards and lack of supervision could expose us to greater delinquencies and charge-offs than we have historically experienced, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 21Table of Contents  Changes in market conditions, including rising interest rates, could adversely affect the rate at which our borrowers prepay their loans and the value of our finance receivables portfolio, as well as increase our financing cost, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Changing market conditions, including but not limited to, changes in interest rates, the availability of credit, the relative economic vitality of the area in which our borrowers and their assets are located, changes in tax laws, other opportunities for investment available to our customers, homeowner mobility, and other economic, social, geographic, demographic, and legal factors beyond our control, may affect the rates at which our borrowers prepay their loans. Generally, in situations where prepayment rates have slowed, the weighted-average life of our finance receivables has increased. Any increase in interest rates may further slow the rate of prepayment for our finance receivables, which could adversely affect our liquidity by reducing the cash flows from, and the value of, the finance receivables we hold for sale or utilize as collateral in our secured funding transactions.Moreover, the vast majority of our finance receivables are fixed-rate finance receivables, which generally decline in value if interest rates increase. As such, if changing market conditions cause interest rates to increase substantially, the value of our fixed-rate finance receivables could decline. Recent increases in market interest rates could negatively impact our net interest income and further increases in market interest rates could continue to negatively impact such net interest income, as well as our cash flow from operations and results of operations. We are generally unable to increase the interest rate on our loans to offset any increases in our cost of funds as market interest rates increase. Additionally, because we are subject to applicable legal and regulatory restrictions in certain jurisdictions that limit the maximum interest rate that we may charge on certain of our loans, our yield, as well as our cash flows from operations and results of operations, could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to increase the interest rates charged on newly originated loans to offset any increases in our cost of funds as market interest rates increase. Accordingly, any increase in interest rates could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We may be required to indemnify, or repurchase finance receivables from, purchasers of finance receivables that we have sold or securitized, or which we will sell or securitize in the future, if our finance receivables fail to meet certain criteria or characteristics or under other circumstances, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We sold a portfolio of real estate loans for aggregate cash proceeds of $100 million with a carrying value of $82 million in December 2018. In 2016, we sold: (i) our interests in the SpringCastle Portfolio in the SpringCastle Interests Sale; (ii) $602 million of personal loans in the Lendmark Sale; and (iii) $308 million of our legacy real estate loan portfolio. In addition, we sold $6.4 billion of our legacy real estate loan portfolio in 2014. As of December 31, 2018, we have securitized $8.5 billion of our personal loan portfolio. The documents governing our finance receivable sales and securitizations contain provisions that require us to indemnify the purchasers of securitized finance receivables, or to repurchase the affected finance receivables, under certain circumstances. While our sale and securitization documents vary, they generally contain customary provisions that may require us to repurchase finance receivables if:•our representations and warranties concerning the quality and characteristics of the finance receivable are inaccurate;•there is borrower fraud; or•we fail to comply, at the individual finance receivable level or otherwise, with regulatory requirements in connection with the origination and servicing of the finance receivables.As a result of the current market environment, we believe that many purchasers or investors in finance receivables (including through securitizations) are particularly aware of the conditions under which originators must indemnify purchasers or repurchase finance receivables and would benefit from enforcing any repurchase remedies that they may have. At its extreme, our exposure to repurchases or our indemnification obligations under our representations and warranties could include the current unpaid balance of all finance receivables that we have sold or securitized, and which are not subject to settlement agreements with purchasers.The risk of loss on the finance receivables that we have securitized is recognized in our allowance for finance receivable losses since all of our loan securitizations are recorded on our balance sheet. If we are required to indemnify purchasers or repurchase finance receivables that we sell or have sold that result in losses that exceed our reserve for sales recourse or recognize losses on securitized finance receivables that exceed our recorded allowance for finance receivable losses associated with our securitizations, this could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 22Table of Contents  Our business and reputation may be materially impacted by information system failures or network disruptions.Our business relies heavily on information systems to deliver products and services to our customers, and to manage our ongoing operations. These systems may encounter service disruptions due to system, network or software failure, security breaches, computer viruses, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions.  In addition, denial-of-service attacks could overwhelm our internet sites and prevent us from adequately serving customers. Cyberthreats are constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. We may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities, which may allow them to persist in our system environment over long periods of time. Cyberthreats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our computer systems and networks and those of our third party vendors. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and our business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient to adequately address the disruption. A disruption could impair our ability to offer and process our loans, provide customer service, perform collections or other necessary business activities, which could result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. There may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personally identifiable information, that could subject us to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.Our operations rely heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential customer and other information including, among other things, personally identifiable information (“PII”), in our computer systems and networks, as well as those of third parties. Our branch offices and centralized servicing centers, as well as our administrative and executive offices, are part of an electronic information network that is designed to permit us to originate and track finance receivables and collections and perform other tasks that are part of our everyday operations. We devote significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect our computer systems and data. These security measures may not be sufficient and may be vulnerable to hacking, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our computer systems. Any failure, interruption, or breach in our cyber security could result in reputational harm, disruption of our customer relationships, or our inability to originate, process and service our finance receivable products. Further, any of these cyber security and operational risks could expose us to lawsuits by customers for identity theft or other damages resulting from the misuse of their PII and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, regulators may impose penalties or require remedial action if they identify weaknesses in our security systems, and we may be required to incur significant costs to increase our cyber security to address any vulnerabilities that may be discovered or to remediate the harm caused by any security breaches. As part of our business, we may share confidential customer information and proprietary information with customers, vendors, service providers, and business partners. The information systems of these third parties may be vulnerable to security breaches and, despite our best efforts, we may not be able to ensure that these third parties have appropriate security controls in place to protect the information we share with them. If our confidential information is intercepted, stolen, misused, or mishandled while in possession of a third party, it could result in reputational harm to us, loss of customer business, and additional regulatory scrutiny, and it could expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Although we have insurance that is intended to cover certain losses from such events, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate or available.We are also subject to the theft or misuse of physical customer and employee records at our facilities.Our branch offices and centralized servicing centers have physical customer records necessary for day-to-day operations that contain extensive confidential information about our customers, including financial and PII. We also retain physical records in various storage locations. The loss or theft of customer information and data from our branch offices, central servicing facilities, or other storage locations could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and penalties and could expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, if we cannot locate original documents (or copies, in some cases) for certain finance receivables, we may not be able to collect on those finance receivables. 23Table of Contents  Certain of our operations rely on external vendors.We rely on third party vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations. For example, we outsource a portion of our information systems, communication, data management and transaction processing to third parties. Accordingly, we are exposed to the risk that these vendors might not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements or service level agreements because of changes in the vendor’s organizational structure, financial condition, support for existing products and services, or strategic focus. Such failure to perform could be disruptive to our operations, and have a materially adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. These third parties are also sources of risk associated with operational errors, system interruptions or breaches and unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If the vendors encounter any of these issues, we could be exposed to disruption of service, damage to reputation and litigation. Our insurance operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including claims, catastrophic events, underwriting risks and dependence on a primary distribution channel.Insurance claims and policyholder liabilities are difficult to predict and may exceed the related reserves set aside for claims (losses) and associated expenses for claims adjudication (loss adjustment expenses). Additionally, events such as natural disasters, pandemic disease, cyber security breaches and other types of catastrophes, and prolonged economic downturns, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Other risks relating to our insurance operations include changes to laws and regulations applicable to us, as well as changes to the regulatory environment, such as: changes to laws or regulations affecting capital and reserve requirements; frequency and type of regulatory monitoring and reporting; consumer privacy, use of customer data and data security; benefits or loss ratio requirements; insurance producer licensing or appointment requirements; required disclosures to consumers; and collateral protection insurance (i.e., insurance some of our lender companies purchase, at the customer’s expense, on that customer’s loan collateral for the periods of time the customer fails to adequately, as required by his loan, insure his collateral). Because our customers do not directly agree to the amount charged for collateral protection at the time it is purchased, regulators may in the future prohibit our insurance companies from providing this insurance to our lending operations. Moreover, our insurance companies are predominately dependent on our lending operations as the primary source of business and product distribution. If our lending operations discontinue offering insurance products, including as a result of regulatory requirements, our insurance operations would need to find an alternate distribution partner for their products, of which there can be no assurance.We are a party to various lawsuits and proceedings and may become a party to various lawsuits and proceedings in the future which, if resolved in a manner adverse to us, could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.In the normal course of business, from time to time, we have been named and may be named in the future as a defendant in various legal actions, including governmental investigations, examinations or other proceedings, arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with our business activities. Certain of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. Some of these proceedings are pending in jurisdictions that permit damage awards disproportionate to the actual economic damages alleged to have been incurred. The continued occurrences of large damage awards in general in the United States, including large punitive damage awards in certain jurisdictions that bear little or no relation to actual economic damages incurred by plaintiffs, create the potential for an unpredictable result in any given proceeding. A large judgment that is adverse to us could cause our reputation to suffer, encourage additional lawsuits against us and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. For additional information regarding pending legal proceedings and other contingencies, see Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.Our use of derivatives exposes us to credit and market risks.From time to time, we may enter into derivative financial instruments for economic hedging purposes, such as managing our exposure to interest rate risk. By using derivative instruments, we are exposed to credit and market risks, including the risk of loss associated with variations in the spread between the asset yield and the funding and/or hedge cost, default risk, and the risk of insolvency or other inability of the counterparty to a particular derivative financial instrument to perform its obligations.If we lose the services of any of our key management personnel, our business could suffer.Our future success significantly depends on the continued service and performance of our key management personnel. Competition for these employees is intense and we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel. We do not maintain any “key man” or other related insurance. The loss of the service of members of our senior management or key team members, or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed, could materially harm our business. 24Table of Contents  Employee misconduct could harm us by subjecting us to monetary loss, significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm.Our reputation is critical to developing and maintaining relationships with our existing and potential customers and third parties with whom we do business. There is a risk that our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. For example, if an employee were to engage—or be accused of engaging—in illegal or suspicious activities including fraud or theft, we could suffer direct losses from the activity, and in addition we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial condition, customer relationships, and ability to attract future customers or employees. Employee misconduct could prompt regulators to allege or to determine based upon such misconduct that we have not established adequate supervisory systems and procedures to inform employees of applicable rules or to detect and deter violations of such rules. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent misconduct may not be effective in all cases. Misconduct by our employees, or even unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct, could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business.We may not be able to make technological improvements as quickly as some of our competitors, which could harm our ability to compete with our competitors and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial and lending institutions to better serve customers and reduce costs. Our future success and, in particular, the success of our centralized operations, will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services as quickly as some of our competitors or be successful in marketing these products and services to our existing and new customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could harm our ability to compete with our competitors and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.As part of our growth strategy, we have committed to building our lending business. If we are unable to successfully implement our growth strategy, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.We believe that our future success depends on our ability to implement our growth strategy, the key feature of which has been to shift our primary focus to originating personal loans as well as acquiring portfolios of personal loans, pursuing acquisitions of companies, and/or establishing joint ventures or other strategic alliances. We have also expanded into internet lending through our centralized operations.We may not be able to implement our new strategy successfully, and our success depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:•address the risks associated with our focus on personal loans (including direct auto loans), including, but not limited to consumer demand and changes in economic conditions and interest rates;•address the risks associated with the new centralized method of originating and servicing our internet loans through our centralized operations, which represents a departure from our traditional high-touch branch-based servicing function and includes the potential for higher default and delinquency rates;•integrate, and develop the expertise required to capitalize on, our centralized operations;•obtain regulatory approval in connection with the acquisition of loan portfolios and/or companies in the business of selling loans or related products;•comply with regulations in connection with doing business and offering loan products over the Internet, including various state and federal e-signature rules mandating that certain disclosures be made, and certain steps be followed in order to obtain and authenticate e-signatures, with which we have limited experience;•finance future growth; and•successfully source, underwrite and integrate new acquisitions of loan portfolios and other businesses. 25Table of Contents  In order for us to realize the benefits associated with our new focus on originating and servicing personal loans and growing our business, we must implement our strategic objectives in a timely and cost-effective manner as well as anticipate and address any risks to which we may become subject. In any event, we may not realize these benefits for many years, or our competitors may introduce more compelling products, services or enhancements. If we are not able to realize the benefits of our personal loan focus, or if we do not do so in a timely manner, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be negatively affected which would have a material adverse effect on our business.If goodwill and other intangible assets that we recorded in connection with the OneMain Acquisition become impaired, it could have a negative impact on our profitability.Goodwill represents the amount of acquisition cost over the fair value of net assets we acquired in connection with the OneMain Acquisition. If the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Any such adjustments are reflected in our results of operations in the periods in which the impairments become known. During 2018, we recorded an $8 million impairment on our other intangible assets related to indefinite-lived licenses in connection with the sale of our Yosemite insurance subsidiary. We did not record any impairment charges on our goodwill and other intangible assets during 2017 or 2016. There can be no assurance that our future evaluations of goodwill and other intangible assets will not result in findings of impairments and related write-downs, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2018, our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $1.4 billion and $388 million, respectively. We ceased real estate lending and the purchase of retail sales finance contracts in 2012 and are in the process of liquidating these portfolios, which subjects us to certain risks which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity if we do not effectively manage such risks.In connection with our plan for strategic growth and new focus on consumer lending, we have engaged in a number of restructuring initiatives, including, but not limited to, ceasing real estate lending, ceasing purchasing retail sales finance contracts and revolving retail accounts from the sale of consumer goods and services by retail merchants, closing certain of our branches and reducing our workforce.Since 2014, we entered into a series of transactions relating to the sales of our beneficial interests in our real estate loans, the related servicing of these loans, and the sales of certain performing and non-performing real estate loans, which substantially completed our plan to liquidate our real estate loans. Consequently, as of December 31, 2018, our real estate loans held for sale totaled $103 million.Moreover, if we fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the restructuring of our business and associated liquidation of our legacy portfolios or are subjected to litigation or claims for indemnification for breaches of representations or warranties made in connection with our previous real estate loan sales, we may experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We could face environmental liability and costs for damage caused by hazardous waste (including the cost of cleaning up contaminated property) if we foreclose upon or otherwise take title to real estate pledged as collateral.If a real estate loan goes into default, we may start foreclosure proceedings in appropriate circumstances, which could result in our taking title to the mortgaged real estate. We also consider alternatives to foreclosure, such as “short sales,” where we do not take title to mortgaged real estate. There is a risk that toxic or hazardous substances could be found on property after we take title. In addition, we own certain properties through which we operate our business, such as the buildings at our headquarters and certain servicing facilities. As the owner of any property where hazardous waste is present, we could be held liable for clean-up and remediation costs, as well as damages for any personal injuries or property damage caused by the condition of the property. We may also be responsible for these costs if we are in the chain of title for the property, even if we were not responsible for the contamination and even if the contamination is not discovered until after we have sold the property. Costs related to these activities and damages could be substantial. Although we have policies and procedures in place to investigate properties for potential hazardous substances before taking title to properties, these reviews may not always uncover potential environmental hazards. 26Table of Contents  Our asset valuation may include methodologies, models, estimations and assumptions which are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to asset valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We use estimates, assumptions, and judgments when certain financial assets and liabilities are measured and reported at fair value. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on quoted market prices and/or other observable inputs provided by independent third party sources, when available. When such third party information is not available, fair value is estimated primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling techniques utilizing assumptions such as credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and other relevant inputs. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these areas could materially impact our future financial condition and results of operations.During periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain assets if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be certain asset classes in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the current financial environment. In such cases, certain asset valuations may require more subjectivity and management judgment. As such, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation. Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of assets as reported within our consolidated financial statements, and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. Decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.The processes we use to estimate the fair value of financial instruments, as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations, depend upon the use of analytical and forecasting models. If these models are inadequate or inaccurate due to flaws in their design or implementation, the fair value of such financial instruments may not accurately reflect what we could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments, or we may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures. Any such failure in our analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY AND REGULATIONWe operate in a highly competitive market, and we cannot ensure that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.The consumer finance industry is highly competitive. Our profitability depends, in large part, on our ability to underwrite and originate finance receivables. We compete with other consumer finance companies as well as other types of financial institutions that offer similar consumer financial products and services. Some of these competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we possess. Some competitors may also have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that may not be available to us. While banks and credit card companies have decreased their lending to non-prime customers in recent years, there is no assurance that such lenders will not resume those lending activities. Further, because of increased regulatory pressure on payday lenders, many of those lenders are starting to make more traditional installment consumer loans in order to reduce regulatory scrutiny of their practices, which could increase competition in markets in which we operate. We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our businesses are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business and failure to comply with such regulations may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our businesses are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, and various state authorities regulate and supervise our insurance operations. The laws under which a substantial amount of our consumer and real estate businesses are conducted generally: provide for state licensing of lenders and, in some cases, licensing of employees involved in real estate loan modifications; impose limits on the terms of consumer credit, including amounts, interest rates and charges; regulate whether and under what circumstances insurance and other ancillary products may be offered to consumers in connection with a consumer credit transaction; regulate the manner in which we use personal data; and provide for other consumer protections. We are also subject to extensive servicing regulations which we must comply with when servicing our legacy real estate loans and the SpringCastle Portfolio, and which we will have to comply with if we acquire loan portfolios in the future and assume the servicing obligations for the acquired loans or other financial assets. The extent of state regulation of our insurance business varies by product and by jurisdiction, but relates primarily to the following: licensing; conduct of business; periodic examination of the affairs of insurers; form and content of required financial reports; standards of solvency; limitations on  27Table of Contents  dividend payments and other affiliate transactions; types of products offered; approval of policy forms and premium rates; formulas to calculate any unearned premium refund due to an insured customer; permissible investments; deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders; reserve requirements for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes; and claims processing.All of our operations are subject to regular examination by state and federal regulators, and as a whole, our entities are subject to several hundred regulatory examinations in a given year. These examinations may result in requirements to change our policies or practices, and in some cases, we are required to pay monetary fines or make reimbursements to customers. Many state regulators and some federal regulators have indicated an intention to pool their resources in order to conduct examinations of licensed entities, including us, at the same time (referred to as a “multi-state” examination). This could result in more in-depth examinations, which could be costlier and lead to more significant enforcement actions.We are also subject to potential enforcement, supervisions and other actions that may be brought by state attorneys general or other state enforcement authorities and other governmental agencies. Any such actions could subject us to civil money penalties, customer remediation and increased compliance costs, as well as damage our reputation and brand and could limit or prohibit our ability to offer certain products and services or engage in certain business practices.State attorneys general have stated their intention to fill any void left by diminished CFPB enforcement and have a variety of tools at their disposal to enforce state and federal consumer financial laws. First, Section 1042 of the Dodd-Frank Act grants state attorneys general the ability to enforce the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act’s authority and to secure remedies provided in the Dodd-Frank Act against entities within their jurisdiction. State attorneys general also have enforcement authority under state law with respect to unfair or deceptive practices. Generally, under these statutes, state attorneys general may conduct investigations, bring actions, and recover civil penalties or obtain injunctive relief against entities engaging in unfair, deceptive, or fraudulent acts. Attorneys general may also coordinate among themselves to enter into multi-state actions or settlements. Finally, several consumer financial laws like the Truth in Lending Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act grant enforcement or litigation authority to state attorneys general. Should the CFPB decrease its enforcement activity under the Trump administration, we expect to see an increase in actions brought by state attorneys general. The Department of Defense has made changes to the regulations that have been promulgated as a result of the Military Lending Act. Effective October 3, 2016, we are subject to the limitations of the Military Lending Act, which places a 36% “all-in” annual percentage rate limitation on certain fees, charges, interest, and credit and non-credit insurance premiums for non-purchase money loans made to active military service, their spouses, or covered dependents. We are also no longer able to make non-purchase money loans to those customers that are secured by motor vehicles.We are also subject to potential changes in state law, which could lower the interest-rate limit that non-depository financial institutions may charge for consumer loans or could expand the definition of interest under state law to include the cost of ancillary products, such as insurance.We believe that we maintain all material licenses and permits required for our current operations and are in substantial compliance with all applicable federal, state and local regulations, but we may not be able to maintain all requisite licenses and permits, and the failure to satisfy those and other regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, changes in laws or regulations applicable to us could subject us to additional licensing, registration and other regulatory requirements in the future or could adversely affect our ability to operate or the manner in which we conduct business.A material failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in regulatory actions, including substantial fines or penalties, lawsuits and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.For more information with respect to the regulatory framework affecting our businesses, see “Business—Regulation” included in this report.Requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and oversight by the CFPB significantly increase our regulatory costs and burdens.The Dodd-Frank Act was adopted in 2010. This law and the related regulations affect our operations in terms of increased oversight of financial services products by the CFPB, and the imposition of restrictions on the allowable terms for certain consumer credit transactions. The CFPB has significant authority to implement and enforce federal consumer finance laws, including the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act and new requirements for financial services products provided for in the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the authority to identify and prohibit unfair,  28Table of Contents  deceptive, or abusive acts and practices. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provides the CFPB with broad supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over various consumer financial products and services, including the ability to require reimbursements and other payments to customers for alleged legal violations, and to impose significant penalties, as well as injunctive relief that prohibits lenders from engaging in allegedly unlawful practices. Further, state attorneys general and state regulators are authorized to bring civil actions to enforce certain consumer protection provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The industry investigation and enforcement provisions of Title X of the Dodd Frank Act may adversely affect our business if the CFPB or one or more state attorneys general or state regulators believe that we have violated any federal consumer financial protection laws, including the prohibition in Title X against unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices.The CFPB currently has supervisory authority over our real estate servicing activities, and may in the future have supervisory authority over at least portions of our consumer lending business. It also has the authority to bring enforcement actions for violations of laws over which it has jurisdiction regardless of whether it has supervisory authority for a given product or service. Effective in January 2014, the CFPB finalized mortgage servicing regulations, which makes it more difficult and expensive to service mortgages. The Dodd-Frank Act also gives the CFPB supervisory authority over entities that are designated as “larger participants” in certain financial services markets, including consumer installment loans and related products. The CFPB has published regulations for “larger participants” in the market of auto finance, and we have been designated as a larger participant in this market. The larger-participant rule for consumer installment loans was one of the rulemaking initiatives the CFPB designated as inactive in its Spring 2018 rulemaking agenda. It is not known if or when the CFPB may consider reactivating the rulemaking process for the larger participant rule for consumer installment loans. The CFPB’s broad supervisory and enforcement powers could affect our business and operations significantly in terms of increased operating and regulatory compliance costs, and limits on the types of products we offer and the manner in which they are offered, among other things. See “Business—Regulation” included in this report for further information on the CFPB.The CFPB and certain state regulators have acted against some lenders regarding, for instance, debt collection and the marketing of ancillary products offered by the lenders in connection with their loans. The products included debt cancellation/suspension products and other types of payment protection insurance. We collect on delinquent debt. We also sell optional insurance and non-insurance products in connection with our loans. Our debt collection practices and sales of optional insurance and non-insurance products could be challenged in a similar manner by the CFPB or state consumer lending regulators.Some of the rule-making under the Dodd-Frank Act remains to be done. As a result, the complete impact of the Dodd-Frank Act remains uncertain. The CFPB has indicated that it expects to issue a proposed rule addressing third party debt collection, including communication practices and consumer disclosures by March 2019. The CFPB also announced that it is considering rulemaking to further clarify the meaning of “abusive” under section 1031 of the Dodd Frank Act. It is not clear what form these and other remaining regulations will ultimately take, or how our business will be affected. No assurance can be given that the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations or any other new legislative changes enacted will not have a significant impact on our business.For more information with respect to the regulatory framework affecting our businesses, see “Business—Regulation” included in this report.Current and proposed regulations relating to consumer privacy, data protection and information security could increase our costs.We are subject to a number of federal and state consumer privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations. For example, we are subject to the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which governs the use of PII by financial institutions. Moreover, various state laws and regulations may require us to notify customers, employees, state attorneys general, regulators and others in the event of a security breach. Federal and state legislators and regulators are increasingly pursuing new guidance, laws, and regulations relating to consumer privacy, data protection and information security. Compliance with current or future customer privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations could result in higher compliance, technology or other operating costs. Any violations of these laws and regulations may require us to change our business practices or operational structure, and could subject us to material legal claims, monetary penalties, sanctions, and the obligation to compensate and/or notify customers, employees, state attorneys general, regulators and others or take other remedial actions. 29Table of Contents  Our use of third party vendors is subject to regulatory review.Recently, the CFPB and other regulators have issued regulatory guidance focusing on the need for financial institutions to perform due diligence and ongoing monitoring of third party vendor relationships which increases the scope of management involvement and decreases the benefit that we receive from using third party vendors. Moreover, if our regulators conclude that we have not met the standards for oversight of our third party vendors, we could be subject to enforcement actions, civil monetary penalties, supervisory orders to cease and desist or other remedial actions, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and operating results. Further, federal and state regulators have been scrutinizing the practices of lead aggregators and providers recently.  If regulators place restrictions on certain practices by lead aggregators or providers, our ability to use them as a source for applicants could be affected.Changes in federal, state or local tax laws could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Tax Act was enacted in December 2017. The Tax Act, among other things, reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. In addition, the Tax Act limits certain deductions and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. In the long-term, we anticipate that we will realize an overall benefit from the reduction in the tax rate slightly offset by potential deductions disallowed under the current law. However, we recognized an $81 million tax charge in 2017 primarily the result of the lower corporate tax rate, which required us to remeasure our net deferred tax asset to reflect the lower corporate tax rate. We cannot predict the long-term impact of the Tax Act on the overall economy and our customers at this time. Our customers are likely to experience varying effects from the provisions of the Tax Act both positive and negative. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the Tax Act will not negatively impact our operating results, financial condition, and business operations.We purchase and sell finance receivables, including charged off receivables and receivables where the borrower is in default. This practice could subject us to heightened regulatory scrutiny, which may expose us to legal action, cause us to incur losses and/or limit or impede our collection activity.As part of our business model, we purchase and sell finance receivables. Although the borrowers for some of these finance receivables are current on their payments, other borrowers may be in default (including in bankruptcy) or the debt may have been charged off as uncollectible. The CFPB and other regulators have recently significantly increased their scrutiny of the purchase and sale of debt, and collections practices undertaken by purchasers of debt, especially delinquent and charged off debt. The CFPB has scrutinized sellers of debt for not maintaining sufficient documentation to support and verify the validity or amount of the debt. It has also scrutinized debt collectors for, among other things, their collection tactics, attempting to collect debts that no longer are valid, misrepresenting the amount of the debt and not having sufficient documentation to verify the validity or amount of the debt. Our purchases or sales of receivables could expose us to lawsuits or fines by regulators if we do not have sufficient documentation to support and verify the validity and amount of the finance receivables underlying these transactions, or if we or purchasers of our finance receivables use collection methods that are viewed as unfair or abusive. In addition, our collections could suffer, and we may incur additional expenses if we are required to change collection practices or stop collecting on certain debts as a result of a lawsuit or action on the part of regulators.Recent laws and developments could adversely affect securitizationsThe Dodd-Frank Act also has led and will continue to lead us to incur additional compliance costs in connection with securitization transactions and because it requires, among other things, that a securitizer retain at least a 5% economic interest in the credit risk of the securitized assets, has reduced and will continue to reduce the amount of financing obtained from such transactions. Furthermore, sponsors are prohibited from diluting the required risk retention by dividing the economic interest among multiple parties or hedging or transferring the credit risk the sponsor is required to maintain. Moreover, the SEC’s significant changes to Regulation AB could result in sweeping changes to the commercial and residential mortgage loan securitization markets, as well as to the market for the re-securitization of mortgage-backed securities.Rules relating to securitizations rated by nationally-recognized statistical rating agencies require that the findings of any third party due diligence service providers be made publicly available at least five (5) business days prior to the first sale of securities, which has led and will continue to lead us to incur additional costs in connection with each securitization. 30Table of Contents  Investment Company Act considerations could affect our method of doing business.We intend to continue conducting our business operations so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”). We are a holding company that conducts its businesses primarily through wholly owned subsidiaries and are not an investment company because our subsidiaries are primarily engaged in the non-investment company business of consumer finance. Certain of our subsidiaries rely on exemptions from registration as an investment company, including pursuant to Sections 3(c)(4) and 3(c)(5) of the Investment Company Act. We rely on guidance published by the SEC staff or on our analyses of such guidance to determine our subsidiaries’ qualification under these and other exemptions. To the extent that the SEC staff publishes new or different guidance with respect to these matters, we may be required to adjust our business operations accordingly. Any additional guidance from the SEC staff could provide additional flexibility to us, or it could inhibit our ability to conduct our business operations. There can be no assurance that the laws and regulations governing the Investment Company Act status of real estate or real estate related assets or SEC guidance regarding Investment Company Act exemptions for real estate assets will not change in a manner that adversely affects our operations. If we fail to qualify for an exemption or exception from the Investment Company Act in the future, we could be required to restructure our activities or the activities of our subsidiaries, which could negatively affect us. In addition, if we or one or more of our subsidiaries fail to maintain compliance with the applicable exemptions or exceptions and we do not have another basis available to us on which we may avoid registration, and we were therefore required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we would become subject to substantial regulation with respect to our capital structure, management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons, holdings, and other matters, which could have an adverse effect on us.Real estate loan servicing and loan modifications have come under increased scrutiny from government officials and others, which could make servicing our legacy real estate loan portfolio costlier and more difficult.Real estate loan servicers are under increased scrutiny. In addition, some states and municipalities have passed laws that impose additional duties on foreclosing lenders and real estate loan servicers, such as mandatory mediation or extensive requirements for maintenance of vacant properties, which, in some cases, begin even before a lender has taken title to property. These additional requirements can delay foreclosures, make it uneconomical to foreclose on mortgaged real estate or result in significant additional costs, which could materially adversely affect the value of our portfolio. The CFPB finalized mortgage servicing regulations that became effective in January 2014, which makes it more difficult and expensive to service real estate loans.The U.S. Government implemented a number of federal programs to assist homeowners, including the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), which expired on December 31, 2017. Loans sub-serviced for us by Nationstar Mortgage LLC and Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. were subject to HAMP and were eligible for modification pursuant to HAMP guidelines. We have also implemented proprietary real estate loan modification programs in order to help real estate secured customers remain current on their loans. HAMP, our proprietary loan modification programs and other existing or future legislative or regulatory actions which result in the modification of outstanding real estate loans, may adversely affect the value of, and the returns on, our existing portfolio. 31Table of Contents  RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESSAn inability to access adequate sources of liquidity may adversely affect our ability to fund operational requirements and satisfy financial obligations.Our ability to access capital and credit may be significantly affected by disruption in the U.S. credit markets and the associated credit rating downgrades on our debt. In addition, the risk of volatility surrounding the global economic system and uncertainty surrounding regulatory reforms, such as the Dodd-Frank Act, continue to create uncertainty around access to the capital markets. Historically, we have funded our operations and repaid our debt and other obligations using funds collected from our finance receivable portfolio and new debt issuances. Our current corporate credit ratings are below investment grade and, as a result, our borrowing costs may further increase and our ability to borrow may be limited. Although market conditions have improved since the financial crisis, our traditional borrowing sources, including our ability to cost-effectively issue large amounts of unsecured debt in the capital markets, have been available to us only on a limited basis. In addition to issuing unsecured debt in the public and private markets, we have raised capital through securitization transactions and, although there can be no assurances that we will be able to complete additional securitizations or issue additional unsecured debt, we currently expect our near-term sources of capital markets funding to continue to derive from securitization transactions and unsecured debt offerings.Any future capital markets transactions will be dependent on our financial performance as well as market conditions, which may result in receiving financing on terms less favorable to us than our existing financings. In addition, our access to future financing and our ability to refinance existing debt will depend on a variety of factors such as our financial performance, the general availability of credit, our credit ratings and credit capacity at the time we pursue such financing.If we are unable to complete additional securitization transactions or unsecured debt offerings on a timely basis or upon terms acceptable to us or otherwise access adequate sources of liquidity, our ability to fund our own operational requirements and satisfy financial obligations may be adversely affected.Our indebtedness is significant, which could affect our ability to meet our obligations under our debt instruments and could materially and adversely affect our business and ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry.We currently have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2018, we had $15.2 billion of indebtedness outstanding. Interest expense on our indebtedness totaled $875 million in 2018.The amount of indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:•it may require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of the principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, which reduces the funds available for other purposes, including finance receivable originations;•it could limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing regulatory, business and economic conditions;•it may limit our ability to incur additional borrowings or securitizations for working capital, capital expenditures, business development, debt service requirements, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes, or to refinance our indebtedness;•it may require us to seek to change the maturity, interest rate and other terms of our existing debt;•it may place us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors that are not as highly leveraged;•it may cause a downgrade of our debt and long-term corporate ratings; and•it may cause us to be more vulnerable to periods of negative or slow growth in the general economy or in our business.In addition, meeting our anticipated liquidity requirements is contingent upon our continued compliance with our existing debt agreements. An event of default or declaration of acceleration under one of our existing debt agreements could also result in an event of default and declaration of acceleration under certain of our other existing debt agreements. Such an acceleration of our debt would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to continue as a going concern. If our debt obligations increase, whether due to the increased cost of existing indebtedness or the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the consequences described above could be magnified. 32Table of Contents  There can be no assurance that we will be able to repay or refinance our debt in the future.Certain of our outstanding notes contain covenants that restrict our operations and may inhibit our ability to grow our business and increase revenues.SFC’s indenture and certain of SFC’s notes contain a covenant that limits SFC’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to create or incur liens. The restrictions may interfere with our ability to obtain new or additional financing or may affect the manner in which we structure such new or additional financing or engage in other business activities, which may significantly limit or harm our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. A default and resulting acceleration of obligations could also result in an event of default and declaration of acceleration under certain of our other existing debt agreements. Such an acceleration of our debt would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to continue as a going concern. A default could also significantly limit our alternatives to refinance the debt under which the default occurred as well as other indebtedness. This limitation may significantly restrict our financing options during times of either market distress or our financial distress, which are precisely the times when having financing options is most important.The assessment of our liquidity is based upon significant judgments and estimates that could prove to be materially incorrect.In assessing our current financial position and developing operating plans for the future, management has made significant judgments and estimates with respect to our liquidity, including but not limited to:•our ability to generate sufficient cash to service all of our outstanding debt;•our continued ability to access debt and securitization markets and other sources of funding on favorable terms;•our ability to complete on favorable terms, as needed, additional borrowings, securitizations, finance receivable portfolio sales, or other transactions to support liquidity, and the costs associated with these funding sources, including sales at less than carrying value and limits on the types of assets that can be securitized or sold, which would affect profitability;•the potential for downgrade of our debt by rating agencies, which would have a negative impact on our cost of, and access to, capital;•our ability to comply with our debt covenants;•the amount of cash expected to be received from our finance receivable portfolio through collections (including prepayments) and receipt of finance charges, which could be materially different than our estimates;•the potential for declining financial flexibility and reduced income should we use more of our assets for securitizations and finance receivable portfolio sales; and•the potential for reduced income due to the possible deterioration of the credit quality of our finance receivable portfolios.Additionally, there are numerous risks to our financial results, liquidity, and capital raising and debt refinancing plans that are not quantified in our current liquidity forecasts. These risks include, but are not limited, to the following:•our inability to grow our personal loan portfolio with adequate profitability to fund operations, loan losses, and other expenses;•our inability to monetize assets including, but not limited to, our access to debt and securitization markets;•our inability to obtain the additional necessary funding to finance our operations;•the effect of federal, state and local laws, regulations, or regulatory policies and practices, including the Dodd-Frank Act (which, among other things, established the CFPB with broad authority to regulate and examine financial institutions), on our ability to conduct business or the manner in which we conduct business, such as licensing requirements, pricing limitations or restrictions on the method of offering products, as well as changes that may result from increased regulatory scrutiny of the sub-prime lending industry;•potential liability relating to real estate and personal loans which we have sold or may sell in the future, or relating to securitized loans, if it is determined that there was a non-curable breach of a warranty made in connection with the transaction; 33Table of Contents  •the potential for increasing costs and difficulty in servicing our loan portfolio as a result of heightened nationwide regulatory scrutiny of loan servicing and foreclosure practices in the industry generally, and related costs that could be passed on to us in connection with the subservicing of our real estate loans that were originated or acquired centrally;•reduced cash flows as a result of the liquidation of our real estate loan portfolio;•the potential for additional unforeseen cash demands or acceleration of obligations;•reduced income due to loan modifications where the borrower’s interest rate is reduced, principal payments are deferred, or other concessions are made;•the potential for declines or volatility in bond and equity markets; and•the potential effect on us if the capital levels of our regulated and unregulated subsidiaries prove inadequate to support our current business plans.We intend to repay indebtedness with one or more of the following sources, among others: finance receivable collections, cash on hand, proceeds of additional debt financings (particularly new securitizations and possible new issuances and/or debt refinancing transactions), finance receivable portfolio sales, or a combination of the foregoing. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in undertaking any of these activities to support our operations and repay our obligations.The actual outcome of one or more of our plans could be materially different than expected or one or more of our significant judgments or estimates about the potential effects of these risks and uncertainties could prove to be materially incorrect. In the event of such an occurrence, if third party financing is not available, our liquidity could be materially adversely affected, and as a result, substantial doubt could exist about our ability to continue as a going concern.Current ratings could adversely affect our ability to raise capital in the debt markets at attractive rates, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Each of S&P, Moody’s, and KBRA rates SFC’s debt. Ratings reflect the rating agencies’ opinions of a company’s financial strength, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating.The table below outlines SFC’s long-term corporate debt ratings and outlook by rating agencies:As of December 31, 2018 Rating Outlook     S&P B+ PositiveMoody’s B1 PositiveKBRA BB+ StableCurrently, no other SFC entity has a corporate debt rating, though they may be rated in the future. If SFC’s current ratings continue in effect or our ratings are downgraded, it will likely increase the interest rate that we would have to pay to raise money in the capital markets, making it more expensive for us to borrow money and adversely impacting our access to capital. As a result, our ratings could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 34Table of Contents  Our securitizations may expose us to financing and other risks, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to access the securitization market in the future, which may require us to seek more costly financing.We have securitized, and may in the future securitize, certain of our finance receivables to generate cash to originate or purchase new finance receivables or repay our outstanding indebtedness. In such transactions, we typically convey a pool of finance receivables to a special purpose entity, which, in turn, conveys the finance receivables to a trust (the issuing entity). Concurrently, the trust typically issues non-recourse notes or certificates pursuant to the terms of an indenture or pooling and servicing agreement, which then are transferred to the special purpose entity in exchange for the finance receivables. The securities issued by the trust are secured by the pool of finance receivables. In exchange for the transfer of finance receivables to the issuing entity, we typically receive the cash proceeds from the sale of the trust securities, all residual interests, if any, in the cash flows from the finance receivables after payment of the trust securities, and a 100% beneficial interest in the issuing entity.Although we have successfully completed a number of securitizations since 2012, we can give no assurances that we will be able to complete additional securitizations if the securitization markets become constrained. In addition, the value of any subordinated securities that we may retain in our securitizations might be reduced or, in some cases, eliminated as a result of an adverse change in economic conditions or the financial markets.SFC, OMFG, and OMFH currently act as the servicers with respect to the personal loan securitization trusts and related series of asset-backed securities. If SFC, OMFG, or OMFH defaults in its servicing obligations, an early amortization event could occur with respect to the relevant asset-backed securities and SFC, OMFG, or OMFH, as applicable, could be replaced as servicer. Servicer defaults include, for example, the failure of the servicer to make any payment, transfer or deposit in accordance with the securitization documents, a breach of representations, warranties or agreements made by the servicer under the securitization documents and the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the servicer. Such an early amortization event could damage our reputation and have materially adverse consequences on our liquidity and cost of funds.Rating agencies may also affect our ability to execute a securitization transaction or increase the costs we expect to incur from executing securitization transactions, not only by deciding not to issue ratings for our securitization transactions, but also by altering the criteria and process they follow in issuing ratings. Rating agencies could alter their ratings processes or criteria after we have accumulated finance receivables for securitization in a manner that effectively reduces the value of those finance receivables by increasing our financing costs or otherwise requiring that we incur additional costs to comply with those processes and criteria. We have no ability to control or predict what actions the rating agencies may take in this regard.Further, other matters, such as (i) accounting standards applicable to securitization transactions and (ii) capital and leverage requirements applicable to banks and other regulated financial institutions holding residential mortgage-backed securities or other asset-backed securities, could result in decreased investor demand for securities issued through our securitization transactions, or increased competition from other institutions that undertake securitization transactions. In addition, compliance with certain regulatory requirements, including the Dodd-Frank Act and the Investment Company Act, may affect the type of securitizations that we are able to complete.If it is not possible or economical for us to securitize our finance receivables in the future, we would need to seek alternative financing to support our operations and to meet our existing debt obligations, which may be less efficient and more expensive than raising capital via securitizations and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.RISKS RELATED TO OUR ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTUREThe Apollo-Värde Group is our largest stockholder, and the Apollo-Värde Group may exercise significant influence over us, including through its ability to designate a majority of the members of our board of directors, and its interests may conflict with the interests of our other stockholdersEffective June 25, 2018, OMH Holdings, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (“Purchaser”), an entity formed by the Apollo-Värde Group, an investor group led by funds managed by Apollo and Värde, completed its purchase of 54,937,500 shares of OMH common stock formerly beneficially owned by Springleaf Financial Holdings, LLC, an entity owned primarily by a private equity fund managed by an affiliate of Fortress. The Apollo-Värde Group holdings represent approximately 40.5% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2018. As a result, the Apollo-Värde Group is our largest stockholder and has a significant influence on all matters requiring a stockholder vote, including the election of our directors; mergers, consolidations and acquisitions; the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other decisions affecting our capital structure; the amendment of our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws; and our winding up  35Table of Contents  and dissolution. This concentration of ownership may delay, deter or prevent acts that would be favored by our other stockholders, including delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of OMH or a merger, takeover or other business combination that may be otherwise favorable to us. As a result, the market price of our common stock could decline, or stockholders might not receive a premium over the then-current market price of our common stock upon a change in control. In addition, this concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in a company with a significant stockholder. See additional information under “Business Overview” in Item 1 of this report.Upon closing of the Apollo-Värde Transaction, we entered into an Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement, which provides the Apollo-Värde Group with the right to designate a majority of the members of our board of directors, plus one director, for so long as the Apollo-Värde Group and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees continue to beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least 33% of our issued and outstanding common stock. With such representation on our board of directors, the Apollo-Värde Group will be able to exercise significant influence over decisions affecting us, including our direction and policies, the appointment of management and any action requiring the vote of our board of directors, including significant corporate action such as mergers and sales of substantially all of our assets and decisions affecting our capital structure. The interests of the Apollo-Värde Group may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of our other stockholders. The Apollo-Värde Group may seek to cause us to take courses of action that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment in us, but which might involve risks to our other stockholders or adversely affect us or our other stockholders. The terms of the Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement are further described in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 25, 2018. The Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to that Current Report on Form 8-K, and such Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 10.1 thereto, is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.Uncertainties regarding the effects of the Apollo-Värde Transaction could adversely affect our business and financial results.The Apollo-Värde Transaction closed on June 25, 2018. Uncertainty about the effects of the Apollo-Värde Transaction on counterparties to contracts, employees and other parties may have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties could cause contract counterparties and others who deal with us to seek to change existing business relationships with us, and may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel for a period of time following the completion of the Apollo-Värde Transaction. In addition, the transition and integration process following the completion of the Apollo-Värde Transaction may place a significant burden on management and internal resources. Any significant diversion of management attention away from our ongoing business and any difficulties encountered during the transition and integration process could adversely affect our financial results following the completion of the Apollo-Värde Transaction.We are a holding company with no operations and rely on our operating subsidiaries to provide us with funds necessary to meet our financial obligations and potentially to pay dividends.We are a holding company with no material direct operations. Our principal assets are the equity interests we directly or indirectly hold in our operating subsidiaries, which own our operating assets. As a result, we are dependent on loans, dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations and potentially to pay dividends on our common stock. Our subsidiaries are legally distinct from us and certain of our subsidiaries are prohibited or restricted from paying dividends or otherwise making funds available to us under certain conditions. For example, our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit their ability to pay dividends or make loans or advances to us, principally to protect policyholders, and certain of our debt agreements limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. If we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries, or if our subsidiaries do not generate sufficient cash from operations, we may be unable to meet our financial obligations or pay dividends, and our board may exercise its discretion not to, pay dividends.We may not pay dividends on our common stock in the future, even if our liquidity and leverage targets are met.On February 11, 2019, the Company declared an initial quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, payable on March 15, 2019 to record holders of our common stock as of the close of business on February 26, 2019. While we intend to pay regular quarterly dividends for the foreseeable future, all subsequent dividends will be reviewed quarterly and declared at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors. As a result, we cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock in future periods, even if our liquidity and target leverage objectives are met. See our “Dividend Policy” in Part II - Item 5 of this report for further information.  36Table of Contents  Certain provisions of an amended and restated stockholders agreement with the Apollo-Värde Group, our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws could hinder, delay or prevent a change in control of OMH, which could adversely affect the price of OMH common stock.Certain provisions of the Stockholders Agreement, our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors or the Apollo-Värde Group. These provisions provide for:•a classified board of directors consisting of nine members with staggered three-year terms;•certain rights to the Apollo-Värde Group and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees with respect to the designation of directors for nomination and election to our board of directors, including the ability to appoint a majority of the members of our board of directors, plus one director, for so long as the Apollo-Värde Group  and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees continue to beneficially own, directly or indirectly at least 33% of our issued and outstanding common stock;•removal of directors only for cause and only with the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the voting interest of stockholders entitled to vote (provided, however, that for so long as the Apollo-Värde Group and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least 30% of our issued and outstanding common stock, directors may be removed with or without cause with the affirmative vote of a majority of the then issued and outstanding voting interest of stockholders entitled to vote);•no ability for stockholders to call special meetings of our stockholders (provided, however, that for so long as the Apollo-Värde Group and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least 20% of our issued and outstanding common stock, any stockholders that collectively beneficially own at least 20% of our issued and outstanding common stock may call special meetings of our stockholders);•advance notice requirements by stockholders with respect to director nominations and actions to be taken at annual meetings;•no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which means that the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock can elect all the directors standing for election;•the ability for stockholders to act outside a meeting by written consent only if unanimous, provided, however, that for so long as the Apollo-Värde Group and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least 20% of our issued and outstanding common stock, our stockholders may act without a meeting by written consent of a majority of our stockholders; and•the issuance of blank check preferred stock by our board of directors from time to time in one or more series and to establish the terms, preferences and rights of any such series of preferred stock, all without approval of our stockholders. Nothing in our restated certificate of incorporation precludes future issuances without stockholder approval of the authorized but unissued shares of our common stock.In addition, these provisions may make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a tender offer, change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by the Apollo-Värde Group, our management or our board of directors. Public stockholders who might desire to participate in these types of transactions may not have an opportunity to do so, even if the transaction is favorable to stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to benefit from a change in control or change our management and board of directors and, as a result, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the ability of public stockholders to realize any potential change of control premium.See additional information under “Business Overview” in Item 1 of this report. The terms of the Amended and Restated Stockholders’ Agreement are described in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 25, 2018, and such Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.  37Table of Contents  Certain of our stockholders have the right to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses as us.The Apollo-Värde Group and its affiliates engage in other investments and business activities in addition to their ownership of us. Under our restated certificate of incorporation, the Apollo-Värde Group and its affiliates have the right, and have no duty to abstain from exercising such right, to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses as us, do business with any of our clients, customers or vendors or employ or otherwise engage any of our officers, directors or employees. If the Apollo-Värde Group and its affiliates, or any of their respective officers, directors or employees acquire knowledge of a potential transaction that could be a corporate opportunity, they have no duty, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to offer such corporate opportunity to us, our stockholders or our affiliates.In the event that any of our directors and officers who is also a director, officer or employee of any of the Apollo-Värde Group or its affiliates acquires knowledge of a corporate opportunity or is offered a corporate opportunity, provided that this knowledge was not acquired solely in such person’s capacity as our director or officer and such person acts in good faith, then even if the Apollo-Värde Group or its affiliates pursues or acquires the corporate opportunity or if the Apollo-Värde Group  or its affiliates do not present the corporate opportunity to us, such person is deemed to have fully satisfied such person’s fiduciary duties owed to us and is not liable to us.Licensing and insurance laws and regulations may delay or impede purchases of our common stock.Certain of the states in which we are licensed to originate loans and the states in which Springleaf and OneMain insurance subsidiaries are domiciled (Indiana and Texas) have laws or regulations which require regulatory approval for the acquisition of “control” of regulated entities. In addition, these Indiana and Texas insurance laws and regulations generally provide that no person may acquire control, directly or indirectly, of a domiciled insurer, unless the person has provided the required information to, and the acquisition is subsequently approved or not disapproved by, the Indiana Department of Insurance and also by the Texas Department of Insurance. Under state insurance laws or regulations, there exists a presumption of “control” when an acquiring party acquires as little as 10% of the voting securities of a regulated entity or of a company which itself controls (directly or indirectly) a regulated entity (the threshold is 10% under the insurance statutes of Indiana and Texas). Therefore, any person acquiring 10% or more of our common stock may need the prior approval of these two-state insurance and/or licensing regulators, or a determination from such regulators that “control” has not been acquired, which could significantly delay or otherwise impede their ability to complete such purchase. The Apollo-Värde Transaction may be deemed a change of control for purposes of certain of our state lending and insurance licenses pursuant to which we operate our lending and insurance businesses. Accordingly, we may be required to obtain approvals for the change of control from some state lending or insurance regulators.RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCKThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our stockholders.The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. If the market price of our common stock declines significantly, public stockholders may be unable to resell their shares at or above their purchase price, if at all. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include:•variations in our quarterly or annual operating results;•changes in our earnings estimates (if provided) or differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts;•the contents of published research reports about us or our industry or the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock in the future;•additions to, or departures of, key management personnel;•any increased indebtedness we may incur in the future;•announcements by us or others and developments affecting us;•actions by institutional stockholders or the Apollo-Värde Group;•litigation and governmental investigations; 38Table of Contents  •changes in market valuations of similar companies;•speculation or reports by the press or investment community with respect to us or our industry in general;•increases in market interest rates that may lead purchasers of our shares to demand a higher yield;•announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments; and•general market, political and economic conditions, including any such conditions and local conditions in the markets in which our borrowers are located.These broad company, market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The stock market in general has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, including in recent months. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.Future offerings of debt or equity securities by us may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.In the future, we may attempt to obtain financing or to further increase our capital resources by issuing additional shares of our common stock or offering debt or other equity securities, including commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior or subordinated notes, debt securities convertible into equity or shares of preferred stock. In particular, we intend to continue to seek opportunities to acquire consumer finance portfolios and/or businesses that engage in consumer finance loan servicing and/or consumer finance loan originations. Future acquisitions could require substantial additional capital in excess of cash from operations. We would expect to finance the capital required for acquisitions through a combination of additional issuances of equity, corporate indebtedness, asset-backed acquisition financing and/or cash from operations.Issuing additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities or securities convertible into equity may dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders at the time of such issuance or reduce the market price of our common stock or both. Upon liquidation, holders of debt securities and preferred shares, if issued, and lenders with respect to other borrowings would receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. Debt securities convertible into equity could be subject to adjustments in the conversion ratio pursuant to which certain events may increase the number of equity securities issuable upon conversion. Preferred shares, if issued, could have a preference with respect to liquidating distributions or a preference with respect to dividend payments that could limit our ability to pay dividends to the holders of our common stock. Our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our common stock bear the risk that our future offerings may reduce the market price of our common stock and dilute their stockholdings in us.The market price of our common stock could be negatively affected by sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 40.5% of our outstanding common stock was held by the Apollo-Värde Group and, subject to certain restrictions set forth in an amended and restated stockholders agreement, can be resold into the public markets in the future in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). A decline in the price of our common stock, whether as a result of sale of stock by the Apollo-Värde Group or otherwise, might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional common stock or other equity securities.The future issuance of additional common stock in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions or otherwise will dilute all other stockholdings.We have an aggregate of 1,864,010,240 shares of common stock authorized but unissued as of January 31, 2019. We may issue all of these shares of common stock without any action or approval by our stockholders, subject to certain exceptions. We also intend to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and may issue common stock in connection with these acquisitions. Any common stock issued in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions, the exercise of outstanding stock options or otherwise would dilute the percentage ownership held by our existing shareholders. 39Table of Contents  Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable reports and prevent fraud.We believe that a control system, no matter how well designed and managed, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. We may not be able to identify all significant deficiencies and/or material weaknesses in our internal controls in the future, and our failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects"
5,OMF,ONEMAIN HOLDINGS INC,2018-02-21,"Risk Factors
.    We face a variety of risks that are inherent in our business. Accordingly, you should carefully consider the following discussion of risks in addition to the other information regarding our business provided in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC. These risks are subject to contingencies which may or may not occur, and we are not able to express a view on the likelihood of any such contingency occurring. New risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our business or financial performance.RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSOur consolidated results of operations and financial condition and our borrowers’ ability to make payments on their loans have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by economic conditions and other factors that we cannot control.Uncertainty and negative trends in general economic conditions in the United States and abroad, including significant tightening of credit markets and a general decline in the value of real property, historically have created a difficult operating environment for our businesses and other companies in our industries. Many factors, including factors that are beyond our control, may impact our consolidated results of operations or financial condition and/or affect our borrowers’ willingness or capacity to make payments on their loans. These factors include: unemployment levels, housing markets, energy costs and interest rates; events such as natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, catastrophes, major medical expenses, divorce or death that affect our borrowers; and the quality of the collateral underlying our receivables. If we experience an economic downturn or if the U.S. economy is unable to continue or sustain its recovery from the most recent economic downturn, or if we become affected by other events beyond our control, we may experience a significant reduction in revenues, earnings and cash flows, difficulties accessing capital and a deterioration in the value of our investments. We may also become exposed to increased credit risk from our customers and third parties who have obligations to us.Moreover, our customers are primarily non-prime borrowers. Accordingly, such borrowers have historically been, and may in the future become, more likely to be affected, or more severely affected, by adverse macroeconomic conditions. If our borrowers default under a finance receivable held directly by us, we will bear a risk of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral, if any, and the outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest of the finance receivable, which could adversely affect our cash flow from operations. In addition, foreclosure of a real estate loan (part of our legacy real estate loan portfolio) is an expensive and lengthy process that can negatively affect our anticipated return on the foreclosed loan. The cost to service our loans may also increase without a corresponding increase in our finance charge income.Also, certain geographic concentrations of our loan portfolio may occur or increase as we adjust our risk and loss tolerance and strategy to achieve our profitability goals. Any geographic concentration may expose us to an increased risk of loss if that geographic region experiences higher unemployment rates than average, natural disasters, weak economic conditions, or other adverse economic factors that disproportionately affect that region. See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for quantification of our largest concentrations of net finance receivables.If aspects of our business, including the quality of our finance receivables portfolio or our borrowers, are significantly affected by economic changes or any other conditions in the future, we cannot be certain that our policies and procedures for underwriting, processing and servicing loans will adequately adapt to such changes. If we fail to adapt to changing economic conditions or other factors, or if such changes affect our borrowers’ willingness or capacity to repay their loans, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity would be materially adversely affected.There are risks associated with the acquisition or sale of assets or businesses or the formation, termination or operation of joint ventures or other strategic alliances or arrangements, including the possibility of increased delinquencies and losses, difficulties with integrating loans into our servicing platform and disruption to our ongoing business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We have previously acquired, and in the future may acquire, assets or businesses, including large portfolios of finance receivables, either through the direct purchase of such assets or the purchase of the equity of a company with such a portfolio. Since we will not have originated or serviced the loans we acquire, we may not be aware of legal or other deficiencies related to origination or servicing, and our review of the portfolio prior to purchase may not uncover those deficiencies. Further, we may have limited recourse against the seller of the portfolio.The ability to integrate and successfully service newly acquired loan portfolios will depend in large part on the success of our development and integration of expanded servicing capabilities, including additional personnel. We may fail to realize some or 20Table of Contents all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction if the integration process takes longer, or is more costly, than expected. Our failure to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating the acquired portfolios with our current business or otherwise to realize any of the anticipated benefits of the transaction could impair our operations. In addition, the integration of future large portfolio or other asset or business acquisitions and the formation, termination or operation of joint ventures or other strategic alliances or arrangements are complex, time-consuming and expensive processes that, without proper planning and effective and timely implementation, could significantly disrupt our business.Potential difficulties we may encounter in connection with these transactions and arrangements include, but are not limited to, the following:•the integration of the assets or business into our information technology platforms and servicing systems;•the quality of servicing during any interim servicing period after we purchase a portfolio but before we assume servicing obligations from the seller or its agents;•the disruption to our ongoing businesses and distraction of our management teams from ongoing business concerns;•incomplete or inaccurate files and records;•the retention of existing customers;•the creation of uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems;•the occurrence of unanticipated expenses; and•potential unknown liabilities associated with the transactions, including legal liability related to origination and servicing prior to the acquisition.For example, in some cases loan files and other information (including servicing records) may be incomplete or inaccurate. If our employees are unable to access customer information easily, or if we are unable to produce originals or copies of documents or accurate information about the loans, collections could be affected significantly, and we may not be able to enforce our right to collect in some cases. Similarly, collections could be affected by any changes to our collection practices, the restructuring of any key servicing functions, transfer of files and other changes that would result from our assumption of the servicing of the acquired portfolios.The anticipated benefits and synergies of our future acquisitions will assume a successful integration, and will be based on projections, which are inherently uncertain, as well as other assumptions. Even if integration is successful, anticipated benefits and synergies may not be achieved.Our recent underwriting changes and strategy of increasing the proportion of secured loan originations within our loan portfolio may lead to declines in, or slower growth than anticipated of, our personal loan net finance receivables and yield, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and growth prospects.Secured loans typically carry lower yields relative to unsecured personal loans. If we are unable to successfully convert lower credit tier customers to our secured loan products or otherwise increase new originations of secured personal loans, this will adversely affect our ability to grow personal loan net finance receivables. In addition, as secured loans continue to represent a larger proportion of our loan portfolio, our yields may be lower than our historical yields in prior periods.If our estimates of allowance for finance receivable losses are not adequate to absorb actual losses, our provision for finance receivable losses would increase, which would adversely affect our results of operations.We maintain an allowance for finance receivable losses. To estimate the appropriate level of allowance for finance receivable losses, we consider known and relevant internal and external factors that affect finance receivable collectability, including the total amount of finance receivables outstanding, historical finance receivable charge-offs, our current collection patterns, and economic trends. Our methodology for establishing our allowance for finance receivable losses is based on the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 450, Contingencies, and, in part, on our historic loss experience. If customer behavior changes as a result of economic conditions and if we are unable to predict how the unemployment rate, housing foreclosures, and general economic uncertainty may affect our allowance for finance receivable losses, our allowance for finance receivable losses may be inadequate. Our allowance for finance receivable losses is an estimate, and if actual finance 21Table of Contents receivable losses are materially greater than our allowance for finance receivable losses, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Neither state regulators nor federal regulators regulate our allowance for finance receivable losses.In June of 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standard Update ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This ASU significantly changes the way that entities will be required to measure credit losses. The new standard requires that the estimated credit loss be based upon an “expected credit loss” approach rather than the “incurred loss” approach currently required. The new approach will require entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable forecasts of collectability. It is anticipated that the expected credit loss model may require earlier recognition of credit losses than the incurred loss approach. This ASU will become effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2020. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2019. We believe the adoption of this ASU will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for more information on this new accounting standard.Our risk management efforts may not be effective.We could incur substantial losses and our business operations could be disrupted if we are unable to effectively identify, manage, monitor, and mitigate financial risks, such as credit risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk, liquidity risk, and other market-related risks, as well as operational risks related to our business, assets and liabilities. To the extent our models used to assess the creditworthiness of potential borrowers do not adequately identify potential risks, the valuations produced would not adequately represent the risk profile of the borrower and could result in a riskier finance receivable profile than originally identified. Our risk management policies, procedures, and techniques, including our scoring technology, may not be sufficient to identify all of the risks we are exposed to, mitigate the risks we have identified or identify concentrations of risk or additional risks to which we may become subject in the future.Our branch loan approval process is decentralized, which may result in variability of loan structures, and could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our branch finance receivable origination process is decentralized. We train our employees individually on-site in the branch to make loans that conform to our underwriting standards. Such training includes critical aspects of state and federal regulatory compliance, cash handling, account management and customer relations. In certain circumstances, subject to approval by district managers and/or directors of operations in certain cases, our branch officers have some authority to approve and structure loans within broadly written underwriting guidelines rather than having all loan terms approved centrally. As a result, there may be variability in finance receivable structure (e.g., whether or not collateral is taken for the loan) and loan portfolios among branch offices or regions, even when underwriting policies are followed. Moreover, we cannot be certain that every loan is made in accordance with our underwriting standards and rules, and we have in the past experienced some instances of loans extended that varied from our underwriting standards. The nature of our approval process could adversely affect our operating results and variances in underwriting standards and lack of supervision could expose us to greater delinquencies and charge-offs than we have historically experienced, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Changes in market conditions, including rising interest rates, could adversely affect the rate at which our borrowers prepay their loans and the value of our finance receivables portfolio, as well as increase our financing cost, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Changing market conditions, including but not limited to, changes in interest rates, the availability of credit, the relative economic vitality of the area in which our borrowers and their assets are located, changes in tax laws, other opportunities for investment available to our customers, homeowner mobility, and other economic, social, geographic, demographic, and legal factors beyond our control, may affect the rates at which our borrowers prepay their loans. Generally, in situations where prepayment rates have slowed, the weighted-average life of our finance receivables has increased. Any increase in interest rates may further slow the rate of prepayment for our finance receivables, which could adversely affect our liquidity by reducing the cash flows from, and the value of, the finance receivables we hold for sale or utilize as collateral in our secured funding transactions.Moreover, the vast majority of our finance receivables are fixed-rate finance receivables, which generally decline in value if interest rates increase. As such, if changing market conditions cause interest rates to increase substantially, the value of our fixed-rate finance receivables could decline. Recent increases in market interest rates could negatively impact our net interest income and further increases in market interest rates could continue to negatively impact such net interest income, as well as our cash flow from operations and results of operations. Our consumer loans generally bear interest at a fixed rate and, 22Table of Contents accordingly, we are generally unable to increase the interest rate on such loans to offset any increases in our cost of funds as market interest rates increase. Additionally, because we are subject to applicable legal and regulatory restrictions in certain jurisdictions that limit the maximum interest rate that we may charge on certain of our consumer loans, our yield, as well as our cash flows from operations and results of operations, could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to increase the interest rates charged on newly originated loans to offset any increases in our cost of funds as market interest rates increase. Accordingly, any increase in interest rates could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We may be required to indemnify, or repurchase finance receivables from, purchasers of finance receivables that we have sold or securitized, or which we will sell or securitize in the future, if our finance receivables fail to meet certain criteria or characteristics or under other circumstances, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.In 2016, we sold our interests in the SpringCastle Portfolio as a result of the SpringCastle Interests Sale, $602 million of personal loans in connection with the Lendmark Sale, and $308 million of our legacy real estate loan portfolio. We securitized $9.8 billion of our consumer loan portfolio as of December 31, 2017. In addition, we sold $6.4 billion of our legacy real estate loan portfolio in 2014. The documents governing our finance receivable sales and securitizations contain provisions that require us to indemnify the purchasers of securitized finance receivables, or to repurchase the affected finance receivables, under certain circumstances. While our sale and securitization documents vary, they generally contain customary provisions that may require us to repurchase finance receivables if:•our representations and warranties concerning the quality and characteristics of the finance receivable are inaccurate;•there is borrower fraud; or•we fail to comply, at the individual finance receivable level or otherwise, with regulatory requirements in connection with the origination and servicing of the finance receivables.As a result of the current market environment, we believe that many purchasers of real estate loans (including through securitizations) are particularly aware of the conditions under which originators must indemnify purchasers or repurchase finance receivables, and would benefit from enforcing any repurchase remedies that they may have. At its extreme, our exposure to repurchases or our indemnification obligations under our representations and warranties could include the current unpaid balance of all finance receivables that we have sold or securitized and which are not subject to settlement agreements with purchasers.The risk of loss on the finance receivables that we have securitized is recognized in our allowance for finance receivable losses since all of our consumer loan securitizations are recorded on-balance sheet. If we are required to indemnify purchasers or repurchase finance receivables that we sell that result in losses that exceed our reserve for sales recourse, or recognize losses on securitized finance receivables that exceed our recorded allowance for finance receivable losses associated with our securitizations, this could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our insurance operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including claims, catastrophic events, underwriting risks and dependence on a primary distribution channel.Insurance claims and policyholder liabilities are difficult to predict and may exceed the related reserves set aside for claims (losses) and associated expenses for claims adjudication (loss adjustment expenses). Additionally, events such as hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes, pandemic disease, cyber security breaches and other types of catastrophes, and prolonged economic downturns, could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Other risks relating to our insurance operations include changes to laws and regulations applicable to us, as well as changes to the regulatory environment. Examples include changes to laws or regulations affecting capital and reserve requirements; frequency and type of regulatory monitoring and reporting; consumer privacy, use of customer data and data security; benefits or loss ratio requirements; insurance producer licensing or appointment requirements; required disclosures to consumers; and collateral protection insurance (i.e., insurance some of our lender companies purchase, at the customer’s expense, on that customer’s loan collateral for the periods of time the customer fails to adequately, as required by his loan, insure his collateral). Because our customers do not affirmatively consent to collateral protection insurance at the time it is purchased, and hence do not directly agree to the amount charged for it, regulators may in the future prohibit our insurance companies from providing this insurance to our lending operations. Moreover, our insurance companies are predominately dependent on our lending operations as the primary source of business and product distribution. If our lending operations discontinue offering insurance products, including as a result of regulatory requirements, our insurance operations would need to find an alternate distribution partner for their products.23Table of Contents We are a party to various lawsuits and proceedings and may become a party to various lawsuits and proceedings in the future which, if resolved in a manner adverse to us, could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.In the normal course of business, from time to time, we have been named and may be named in the future as a defendant in various legal actions, including governmental investigations, examinations or other proceedings, arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with our business activities. Certain of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages, or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. Some of these proceedings are pending in jurisdictions that permit damage awards disproportionate to the actual economic damages alleged to have been incurred. The continued occurrences of large damage awards in general in the United States, including large punitive damage awards in certain jurisdictions that bear little or no relation to actual economic damages incurred by plaintiffs, create the potential for an unpredictable result in any given proceeding. A large judgment that is adverse to us could cause our reputation to suffer, encourage additional lawsuits against us and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. For additional information regarding pending legal proceedings and other contingencies, see Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.If we lose the services of any of our key management personnel, our business could suffer.Our future success significantly depends on the continued service and performance of our key management personnel. Competition for these employees is intense and we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel. We do not maintain any “key man” or other related insurance. The loss of the service of members of our senior management or key team members, or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed, could materially harm our business.Employee misconduct could harm us by subjecting us to monetary loss, significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm.Our reputation is critical to maintaining and developing relationships with our existing and potential customers and third parties with whom we do business. There is a risk that our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. For example, if an employee were to engage—or be accused of engaging—in illegal or suspicious activities including fraud or theft, we could suffer direct losses from the activity, and in addition we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial condition, customer relationships, and ability to attract future customers or employees. Employee misconduct could prompt regulators to allege or to determine based upon such misconduct that we have not established adequate supervisory systems and procedures to inform employees of applicable rules or to detect and deter violations of such rules. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent misconduct may not be effective in all cases. Misconduct by our employees, or even unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct, could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business.Current and proposed regulations relating to consumer privacy, data protection and information security could increase our costs.We are subject to a number of federal and state consumer privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations. For example, we are subject to the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which governs the use of personal financial information by financial institutions. Moreover, various federal and state regulatory agencies require us to notify customers in the event of a security breach. Federal and state legislators and regulators are increasingly pursuing new guidance, laws, and regulation. Compliance with current or future customer privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations could result in higher compliance, technology or other operating costs. Any violations of these laws and regulations may require us to change our business practices or operational structure, and could subject us to legal claims, monetary penalties, sanctions, and the obligation to indemnify and/or notify customers or take other remedial actions.Significant disruptions in the operation of our information systems could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our business relies heavily on information systems to deliver products and services to our customers, and to manage our ongoing operations. These systems may encounter service disruptions due to system, network or software failure, security breaches, computer viruses, natural disasters or other reasons. There can be no assurance that our policies and procedures addressing these issues will adequately address the disruption. A disruption could impair our ability to offer and process consumer loans, provide customer service, perform collections activities or perform other necessary business activities, which could result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability.24Table of Contents Security breaches in our information systems, in the information systems of third parties or in our branches, central servicing facilities, or our internet lending platform or our proprietary company data held by third parties could adversely affect our reputation and could subject us to significant costs and regulatory penalties.Our operations rely heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential customer and other information in our computer systems and networks. Our branch offices and centralized servicing centers, as well as our administrative and executive offices, are part of an electronic information network that is designed to permit us to originate and track finance receivables and collections, and perform several other tasks that are part of our everyday operations. Our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious code that could result in disruption to our business, or the loss or theft of confidential information, including customer information. Any failure, interruption, or breach in our cyber security, including through employee misconduct or any failure of our back-up systems or failure to maintain adequate security surrounding customer information, could result in reputational harm, disruption in the management of our customer relationships, or the inability to originate, process and service our finance receivable products. Further, any of these cyber security and operational risks could result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to lawsuits by customers for identity theft or other damages resulting from the misuse of their personal information and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, regulators may impose penalties or require remedial action if they identify weaknesses in our security systems, and we may be required to incur significant costs to increase our cyber security to address any vulnerabilities that may be discovered or to remediate the harm caused by any security breaches. As part of our business, we may share confidential customer information and proprietary information with clients, vendors, service providers, and business partners. The information systems of these third parties may be vulnerable to security breaches and we may not be able to ensure that these third parties have appropriate security controls in place to protect the information we share with them. If our confidential information is intercepted, stolen, misused, or mishandled while in possession of a third party, it could result in reputational harm to us, loss of customer business, and additional regulatory scrutiny, and it could expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Although we have insurance that is intended to cover certain losses from such events, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate or available.Our branch offices and centralized servicing centers have physical customer records necessary for day-to-day operations that contain extensive confidential information about our customers, including financial and personally identifiable information. We also retain physical records in various storage locations outside of these locations. The loss or theft of customer information and data from our branch offices, central servicing facilities, or other storage locations could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and penalties, and could expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, if we cannot locate original documents (or copies, in some cases), we may not be able to collect on the finance receivables for which we do not have documents.We may not be able to make technological improvements as quickly as some of our competitors, which could harm our ability to compete with our competitors and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial and lending institutions to better serve customers and reduce costs. Our future success and, in particular, the success of our centralized operations, will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services as quickly as some of our competitors or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could harm our ability to compete with our competitors and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We could face environmental liability and costs for damage caused by hazardous waste (including the cost of cleaning up contaminated property) if we foreclose upon or otherwise take title to real estate pledged as collateral.If a real estate loan goes into default, we may start foreclosure proceedings in appropriate circumstances, which could result in our taking title to the mortgaged real estate. We also consider alternatives to foreclosure, such as “short sales,” where we do not take title to mortgaged real estate. There is a risk that toxic or hazardous substances could be found on property after we take title. In addition, we own certain properties through which we operate our business, such as the buildings at our headquarters and certain servicing facilities. As the owner of any property where hazardous waste is present, we could be held liable for clean-up and remediation costs, as well as damages for any personal injuries or property damage caused by the condition of the property. We may also be responsible for these costs if we are in the chain of title for the property, even if we were not 25Table of Contents responsible for the contamination and even if the contamination is not discovered until after we have sold the property. Costs related to these activities and damages could be substantial. Although we have policies and procedures in place to investigate properties for potential hazardous substances before taking title to properties, these reviews may not always uncover potential environmental hazards.If goodwill and other intangible assets that we recorded in connection with the OneMain Acquisition becomes impaired, it could have a negative impact on our profitability.Goodwill represents the amount of acquisition cost over the fair value of net assets we acquired in connection with the OneMain Acquisition. If the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Any such adjustments are reflected in our results of operations in the periods in which the impairments become known. At December 31, 2017, our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $1.4 billion and $440 million, respectively. While we have recorded no impairment charges on our goodwill and other intangible assets during 2017 and 2016, there can be no assurance that our future evaluations of goodwill and other intangible assets will not result in findings of impairments and related write-downs, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We ceased real estate lending and the purchase of retail finance contracts in 2012 and are in the process of liquidating these portfolios, which subjects us to certain risks which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity if we do not effectively manage such risks.In connection with our plan for strategic growth and new focus on consumer lending, we have engaged in a number of restructuring initiatives, including, but not limited to, ceasing real estate lending, ceasing purchasing retail sales contracts and revolving retail accounts from the sale of consumer goods and services by retail merchants, closing certain of our branches and reducing our workforce.In 2014, we entered into a series of transactions relating to the sales of our beneficial interests in our real estate loans, the related servicing of these loans, and the sales of certain performing and non-performing real estate loans, which substantially completed our plan to liquidate our real estate loans. Consequently, as of December 31, 2017, our real estate loans held for investment and held for sale totaled $128 million and $132 million, respectively. Moreover, if we fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the restructuring of our business and associated liquidation of our legacy portfolios or are subjected to litigation or claims for indemnification for breaches of representations or warranties made in connection with our previous real estate loan sales, we may experience an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.As part of our growth strategy, we have committed to building our consumer lending business. If we are unable to successfully implement our growth strategy, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.We believe that our future success depends on our ability to implement our growth strategy, the key feature of which has been to shift our primary focus to originating consumer loans as well as acquiring portfolios of consumer loans, pursuing acquisitions of companies, and/or establishing joint ventures or other strategic alliances or arrangements. We have also expanded into internet lending through our centralized operations.We may not be able to implement our new strategy successfully, and our success depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:•address the risks associated with our focus on personal loans (including direct auto loans), including, but not limited to consumer demand for finance receivables, and changes in economic conditions and interest rates;•address the risks associated with the new centralized method of originating and servicing our internet loans through our centralized operations, which represents a departure from our traditional high-touch branch-based servicing function and includes the potential for higher default and delinquency rates;•integrate, and develop the expertise required to capitalize on, our centralized operations;•obtain regulatory approval in connection with the acquisition of consumer loan portfolios and/or companies in the business of selling consumer loans or related products;26Table of Contents •comply with regulations in connection with doing business and offering loan products over the Internet, including various state and federal e-signature rules mandating that certain disclosures be made and certain steps be followed in order to obtain and authenticate e-signatures, with which we have limited experience;•finance future growth; and•successfully source, underwrite and integrate new acquisitions of loan portfolios and other businesses.In order for us to realize the benefits associated with our new focus on originating and servicing consumer loans and growing our business, we must implement our strategic objectives in a timely and cost-effective manner as well as anticipate and address any risks to which we may become subject. In any event, we may not realize these benefits for many years, or our competitors may introduce more compelling products, services or enhancements. If we are not able to realize the benefits, or if we do not do so in a timely manner, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be negatively affected which would have a material adverse effect on business.RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY AND REGULATIONWe operate in a highly competitive market, and we cannot ensure that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.The consumer finance industry is highly competitive. Our profitability depends, in large part, on our ability to originate finance receivables. We compete with other consumer finance companies as well as other types of financial institutions that offer similar products and services in originating finance receivables. Some of these competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we possess. Some competitors may also have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that may not be available to us. While banks and credit card companies have decreased their lending to non-prime customers in recent years, there is no assurance that such lenders will not resume those lending activities. Further, because of increased regulatory pressure on payday lenders, many of those lenders are starting to make more traditional installment consumer loans in order to reduce regulatory scrutiny of their practices, which could increase competition in markets in which we operate. In addition, in July 2013, the Dodd-Frank Act’s three-year moratorium on banks affiliated with non-financial businesses expired. When the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted in 2010, a moratorium was imposed that prohibited the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation from approving deposit insurance for certain banks controlled by non-financial commercial enterprises. The expiration of the moratorium could result in an increase of traditionally non-financial enterprises entering the banking space, which could increase the number of our competitors. There can be no assurance that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our businesses are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business.Our businesses are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, and various state authorities regulate and supervise our insurance operations. The laws under which a substantial amount of our consumer and real estate businesses are conducted generally: provide for state licensing of lenders and, in some cases, licensing of employees involved in real estate loan modifications; impose limits on the term of a finance receivable, amounts, interest rates and charges on the finance receivables; regulate whether and under what circumstances insurance and other ancillary products may be offered to consumers in connection with a lending transaction; regulate the manner in which we use personal data; and provide for other consumer protections. We are also subject to extensive servicing regulations which we must comply with when servicing our legacy real estate loans and the SpringCastle Portfolio, and which we will have to comply with if we acquire loan portfolios in the future and assume the servicing obligations for the acquired loans or other financial assets. The extent of state regulation of our insurance business varies by product and by jurisdiction, but relates primarily to the following: licensing; conduct of business; periodic examination of the affairs of insurers; form and content of required financial reports; standards of solvency; limitations on dividend payments and other related party transactions; types of products offered; approval of policy forms and premium rates; permissible investments; deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders; reserve requirements for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes; and claims processing.All of our operations are subject to regular examination by state and federal regulators, and as a whole, our entities are subject to several hundred regulatory examinations in a given year. These examinations may result in requirements to change our policies or practices, and in some cases, we are required to pay monetary fines or make reimbursements to customers. Many state regulators and some federal regulators have indicated an intention to pool their resources in order to conduct examinations of licensed entities, including us, at the same time (referred to as a “multi-state” examination). This could result in more in-depth examinations, which could be more costly and lead to more significant enforcement actions.27Table of Contents The CFPB has outlined several proposals under consideration for the purpose of requiring lenders to take steps to ensure consumers have the financial ability to repay their loans. The proposals under consideration would require lenders to determine at the outset of each loan whether a consumer can afford to borrow from the lender and would require that lenders comply with various restrictions designed to ensure that consumers can affordably repay their debt to the lender. To date, the proposals under consideration by the CFPB have not been adopted. If adopted, the proposals outlined by the CFPB may require the Company to make significant changes to its lending practices to develop compliant procedures.We are also subject to potential enforcement, supervisions and other actions that may be brought by state attorneys general or other state enforcement authorities and other governmental agencies. Any such actions could subject us to civil money penalties, customer remediation and increased compliance costs, as well as damage our reputation and brand and could limit or prohibit our ability to offer certain products and services or engage in certain business practices.State attorneys general have stated their intention to fill any void left by diminished CFPB enforcement and have a variety of tools at their disposal to enforce state and federal consumer financial laws. First, Section 1042 of the Dodd-Frank Act grants state attorneys general the ability to enforce the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act’s authority and to secure remedies provided in the Dodd-Frank Act against entities within their jurisdiction. Even if an overhaul of the Dodd-Frank Act eliminates Section 1042, state attorneys general will retain their enforcement authority under state law with respect to unfair or deceptive practices. Under these statutes, state attorneys general may generally conduct investigations, bring actions, and recover civil penalties or obtain injunctive relief against entities engaging in unfair, deceptive, or fraudulent acts. Attorneys general may also coordinate among themselves to enter into multi-state actions or settlements. Finally, several consumer financial laws like the Truth in Lending Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act grant enforcement or litigation authority to state attorneys general. Should the CFPB decrease its enforcement activity under the Trump administration, we expect to see an increase in actions brought by state attorneys general. The Department of Defense has made changes to the regulations that have been promulgated as a result of the Military Lending Act. Effective October 3, 2016, we are subject to the limitations of the Military Lending Act, which places a 36% limitation on all fees, charges, interest rate and credit and non-credit insurance premiums for loans made to members of the military or their dependents. We are also no longer able to make non-purchase money loans secured by motor vehicles to service members and their dependents.We are also subject to potential changes in state law, which could lower the interest-rate limit that non-depository financial institutions may charge for consumer loans or could expand the definition of interest under state law to include the cost of ancillary products, such as insurance.We believe that we maintain all material licenses and permits required for our current operations and are in substantial compliance with all applicable federal, state and local regulations, but we may not be able to maintain all requisite licenses and permits, and the failure to satisfy those and other regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, changes in laws or regulations applicable to us could subject us to additional licensing, registration and other regulatory requirements in the future or could adversely affect our ability to operate or the manner in which we conduct business.A material failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in regulatory actions, including substantial fines or penalties, lawsuits and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.The Apollo-Värde Transaction may be deemed a change of control for purposes of certain of our state lending and insurance licenses pursuant to which we operate our lending and insurance businesses. Accordingly, we may be required to obtain approvals for the change of control from some state lending or insurance regulators.For more information with respect to the regulatory framework affecting our businesses, see “Business—Regulation” included in this report.The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act and the creation of the CFPB significantly increases our regulatory costs and burdens.The Dodd-Frank Act was adopted in 2010. This law and the related regulations affect our operations in terms of increased oversight of financial services products by the CFPB, and the imposition of restrictions on the allowable terms for certain consumer credit transactions. The CFPB has significant authority to implement and enforce federal consumer finance laws, including the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act and new requirements for 28Table of Contents financial services products provided for in the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the authority to identify and prohibit unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provides the CFPB with broad supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over various consumer financial products and services, including the ability to require reimbursements and other payments to customers for alleged legal violations, and to impose significant penalties, as well as injunctive relief that prohibits lenders from engaging in allegedly unlawful practices. Further, state attorneys general and state regulators are authorized to bring civil actions to enforce certain consumer protection provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act and accompanying regulations are being phased in over time, and while some regulations have been promulgated, many others have not yet been proposed or finalized. We cannot predict the terms of all of the final regulations, their intended consequences or how such regulations will affect us or our industry.The CFPB currently has supervisory authority over our real estate servicing activities, and likely will have supervisory authority over our consumer lending business. It also has the authority to bring enforcement actions for violations of laws over which it has jurisdiction regardless of whether it has supervisory authority for a given product or service. Effective in January 2014, the CFPB finalized mortgage servicing regulations, which makes it more difficult and expensive to service mortgages. The Dodd-Frank Act also gives the CFPB supervisory authority over entities that are designated as “larger participants” in certain financial services markets, including consumer installment loans and related products. The CFPB has not yet promulgated regulations that designate “larger participants” for consumer finance companies. If we are designated as a “larger participant” for this market, we also will be subject to supervision and examination by the CFPB with respect to our consumer loan business. The CFPB has published regulations for “larger participants” in the market of auto finance, and we have been designated as a larger participant in this market. The CFPB’s broad supervisory and enforcement powers could affect our business and operations significantly in terms of increased operating and regulatory compliance costs, and limits on the types of products we offer and the manner in which they are offered, among other things. See “Business—Regulation” included in this report for further information on the CFPB.The CFPB and certain state regulators have taken action against select lenders regarding the marketing of products offered by the lenders in connection with their loans. The products included debt cancellation/suspension products written by the lenders which forgave a borrower’s debt or monthly minimum payment upon the occurrence of certain events in the life of the borrower (e.g., death, disability, marriage, divorce, birth of a child, etc.). We sell insurance and non-insurance products in connection with our loans. While insurance products are actively regulated by state insurance departments, sales of insurance and non-insurance products could be challenged in a similar manner by the CFPB or state consumer lending regulators.Our use of third-party vendors is subject to increasing regulatory attention.Recently, the CFPB and other regulators have issued regulatory guidance that has focused on the need for financial institutions to perform increased due diligence and ongoing monitoring of third-party vendor relationships, thus increasing the scope of management involvement and decreasing the benefit that we receive from using third-party vendors. Moreover, if our regulators conclude that we have not met the heightened standards for oversight of our third-party vendors, we could be subject to enforcement actions, civil monetary penalties, supervisory orders to cease and desist or other remedial actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.Changes in federal, state or local tax laws could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. On December 22, 2017, the President signed Public Law 115-97 (the “Tax Act”) into law. The Tax Act contains substantial changes to the U.S. federal income tax code effective January 1, 2018, including a reduction in the federal corporate rate from 35% to 21%. In the long-term, we anticipate that we will have an overall benefit from the reduction in the tax rate slightly offset by potential deductions disallowed under the current law. However, we recognized an $81 million tax charge in 2017. This charge is primarily the result of the lower corporate tax rate, which required us to remeasure our net deferred tax asset to reflect the lower corporate tax rate.  Although we are not aware of any provision in the Tax Act or any other pending tax legislation that would have a material adverse impact on our financial performance, the ultimate impact of the Tax Act may differ from our current assessment due to changes in interpretations and assumptions made by us as well as the issuance of any further regulations or guidance that may alter the operation of the U.S. federal income tax code. At this time, it is unclear how many U.S. states will incorporate these federal law changes, or portions thereof, into their tax codes.  Further, the long-term impact of the Tax Act on the overall economy and our customers cannot be predicted so soon after the implementation of the Tax Act. Our customers are likely to experience varying effects from the provisions of the Tax Act both positive and negative. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the Tax Act will not negatively impact our operating results, financial condition, and future business operations.29Table of Contents We purchase and sell finance receivables, including charged off receivables and receivables where the borrower is in default. This practice could subject us to heightened regulatory scrutiny, which may expose us to legal action, cause us to incur losses and/or limit or impede our collection activity.As part of our business model, we purchase and sell finance receivables. Although the borrowers for some of these finance receivables are current on their payments, other borrowers may be in default (including in bankruptcy) or the debt may have been charged off as uncollectible. The CFPB and other regulators have recently significantly increased their scrutiny of the purchase and sale of debt, and collections practices undertaken by purchasers of debt, especially delinquent and charged off debt. The CFPB has scrutinized sellers of debt for not maintaining sufficient documentation to support and verify the validity or amount of the debt. It has also scrutinized debt collectors for, among other things, their collection tactics, attempting to collect debts that no longer are valid, misrepresenting the amount of the debt and not having sufficient documentation to verify the validity or amount of the debt. Our purchases or sales of receivables could expose us to lawsuits or fines by regulators if we do not have sufficient documentation to support and verify the validity and amount of the finance receivables underlying these transactions, or if we or purchasers of our finance receivables use collection methods that are viewed as unfair or abusive. In addition, our collections could suffer and we may incur additional expenses if we are required to change collection practices or stop collecting on certain debts as a result of a lawsuit or action on the part of regulators.The Dodd-Frank Act also may adversely affect the securitization market because it requires, among other things, that a securitizer must retain at least a 5% economic interest in the credit risk of the securitized assets. Furthermore, sponsors are prohibited from diluting the required risk retention by dividing the economic interest among multiple parties, or hedging or transferring the credit risk the sponsor is required to maintain. Moreover, the SEC’s significant changes to Regulation AB could result in sweeping changes to the commercial and residential mortgage loan securitization markets, as well as to the market for the re-securitization of mortgage-backed securities.Rules relating to securitizations rated by nationally-recognized statistical rating agencies require that the findings of any third-party due diligence service providers be made publicly available at least five (5) business days prior to the first sale of securities, which has led and will continue to lead us to incur additional costs in connection with each securitization.A certain amount of the rule-making under the Dodd-Frank Act remains to be done. As a result, the complete impact of the Dodd-Frank Act remains uncertain. It is not clear what form some of these remaining regulations will ultimately take, or how our business will be affected. No assurance can be given that the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations or any other new legislative changes enacted will not have a significant impact on our business.For more information with respect to the regulatory framework affecting our businesses, see “Business—Regulation” included in this report.Investment Company Act considerations could affect our method of doing business.We intend to continue conducting our business operations so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”). We are a holding company that conducts its businesses primarily through wholly owned subsidiaries and are not an investment company because our subsidiaries are primarily engaged in the non-investment company business of consumer finance. Certain of our subsidiaries rely on exemptions from registration as an investment company, including pursuant to Sections 3(c)(4) and 3(c)(5) of the Investment Company Act. We rely on guidance published by the SEC staff or on our analyses of such guidance to determine our subsidiaries’ qualification under these and other exemptions. To the extent that the SEC staff publishes new or different guidance with respect to these matters, we may be required to adjust our business operations accordingly. Any additional guidance from the SEC staff could provide additional flexibility to us, or it could inhibit our ability to conduct our business operations. There can be no assurance that the laws and regulations governing the Investment Company Act status of real estate or real estate related assets or SEC guidance regarding Investment Company Act exemptions for real estate assets will not change in a manner that adversely affects our operations. If we fail to qualify for an exemption or exception from the Investment Company Act in the future, we could be required to restructure our activities or the activities of our subsidiaries, which could negatively affect us. In addition, if we or one or more of our subsidiaries fail to maintain compliance with the applicable exemptions or exceptions and we do not have another basis available to us on which we may avoid registration, and we were therefore required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we would become subject to substantial regulation with respect to our capital structure, management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons, holdings, and other matters, which could have an adverse effect on us.30Table of Contents Real estate loan servicing and loan modifications have come under increased scrutiny from government officials and others, which could make servicing our legacy real estate loan portfolio more costly and difficult.Real estate loan servicers are under increased scrutiny. In addition, some states and municipalities have passed laws that impose additional duties on foreclosing lenders and real estate loan servicers, such as mandatory mediation or extensive requirements for maintenance of vacant properties, which, in some cases, begin even before a lender has taken title to property. These additional requirements can delay foreclosures, make it uneconomical to foreclose on mortgaged real estate or result in significant additional costs, which could materially adversely affect the value of our portfolio. The CFPB finalized mortgage servicing regulations that became effective in January 2014, which makes it more difficult and expensive to service real estate loans.The U.S. Government implemented a number of federal programs to assist homeowners, including the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), which expired on December 31, 2017. Loans subserviced for us by Nationstar Mortgage LLC and Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. were subject to HAMP and were eligible for modification pursuant to HAMP guidelines. We have also implemented proprietary real estate loan modification programs in order to help real estate secured customers remain current on their loans. HAMP, our proprietary loan modification programs and other existing or future legislative or regulatory actions which result in the modification of outstanding real estate loans, may adversely affect the value of, and the returns on, our existing portfolio.RISKS RELATED TO THE APOLLO-VÄRDE TRANSACTIONFailure to complete the Apollo-Värde Transaction could negatively affect our share price, future business and financial results.Completion of the Apollo-Värde Transaction is not assured and is subject to risks, including the risks that necessary regulatory approvals and clearances will not be obtained or that other closing conditions will not be satisfied. If the Apollo-Värde Transaction is not completed, our ongoing business and financial results may be adversely affected and we will be subject to several risks, including:• our share price may decline to the extent that the current market prices reflect an assumption by the market that the Apollo-Värde Transaction will be completed; and• we may be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Apollo-Värde Transaction.We will be subject to various uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Apollo-Värde Transaction is pending that could adversely affect our financial results.Uncertainty about the effect of the Apollo-Värde Transaction on counterparties to contracts, employees and other parties may have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties could cause contract counterparties and others who deal with us to seek to change existing business relationships with us, and may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Apollo-Värde Transaction is completed and for a period of time thereafter. Employee retention and recruitment may be particularly challenging prior to completion of the Apollo-Värde Transaction, as our employees and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us following the Apollo-Värde Transaction.The pursuit of the Apollo-Värde Transaction and the preparation involved may place a significant burden on management and internal resources. Any significant diversion of management attention away from ongoing business and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could affect our financial results prior to and/or following the completion of the Apollo-Värde Transaction and could limit us from pursuing attractive business opportunities and making other changes to our business prior to completion of the Apollo-Värde Transaction.In addition, the Share Purchase Agreement entered into in connection with the Apollo-Värde Transaction imposes certain restrictions on us. Without the consent of the Apollo-Värde Group, we are restricted from making certain acquisitions and divestitures, entering into certain contracts, incurring certain indebtedness and expenditures, paying certain dividends, repurchasing or issuing securities outside of existing share repurchase and equity award programs, and taking other specified actions until the earlier of the completion of the Apollo-Värde Transaction or the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement. These restrictions may prevent or delay pursuit of strategic corporate or business opportunities that may arise prior to the consummation of the Apollo-Värde Transaction. Adverse effects arising during the pendency of the Apollo-Värde Transaction could be exacerbated by any delays in consummation of the Apollo-Värde Transaction or termination of the related Share Purchase Agreement.31Table of Contents RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESSAn inability to access adequate sources of liquidity may adversely affect our ability to fund operational requirements and satisfy financial obligations.Our ability to access capital and credit may be significantly affected by disruption in the U.S. credit markets and the associated credit rating downgrades on our debt. In addition, the risk of volatility surrounding the global economic system and uncertainty surrounding regulatory reforms, such as the Dodd-Frank Act, continue to create uncertainty around access to the capital markets. Historically, we funded our operations and repaid our debt and other obligations using funds collected from our finance receivable portfolio and new debt issuances. Although market conditions have improved since the financial crisis, our traditional borrowing sources, including our ability to cost-effectively issue large amounts of unsecured debt in the capital markets, particularly issuances of commercial paper, have generally not been available to us. We have primarily raised capital through securitization transactions and, although there can be no assurances that we will be able to complete additional securitizations, we currently expect our near-term sources of capital markets funding to continue to derive from securitization transactions and unsecured debt offerings.If we are unable to complete additional securitization transactions on a timely basis or upon terms acceptable to us or otherwise access adequate sources of liquidity, our ability to fund our own operational requirements and satisfy financial obligations may be adversely affected.Our indebtedness is significant, which could affect our ability to meet our obligations under our debt instruments and could materially and adversely affect our business and ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry.We currently have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2017, we had $15.1 billion of indebtedness outstanding. Interest expense on our indebtedness totaled $816 million in 2017.The amount of indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:•it may require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of the principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, which reduces the funds available for other purposes, including finance receivable originations;•it could limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing regulatory, business and economic conditions;•it may limit our ability to incur additional borrowings or securitizations for working capital, capital expenditures, business development, debt service requirements, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes, or to refinance our indebtedness;•it may require us to seek to change the maturity, interest rate and other terms of our existing debt;•it may place us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors that are proportionately not as highly leveraged;•it may cause a downgrade of our debt and long-term corporate ratings; and•it may cause us to be more vulnerable to periods of negative or slow growth in the general economy or in our business.In addition, meeting our anticipated liquidity requirements is contingent upon our continued compliance with our existing debt agreements. An event of default or declaration of acceleration under one of our existing debt agreements could also result in an event of default and declaration of acceleration under certain of our other existing debt agreements. Such an acceleration of our debt would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to continue as a going concern. If our debt obligations increase, whether due to the increased cost of existing indebtedness or the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the consequences described above could be magnified.There can be no assurance that we will be able to repay or refinance our debt in the future.32Table of Contents Certain of our outstanding notes contain covenants that restrict our operations and may inhibit our ability to grow our business and increase revenues.SFC’s indenture and certain of SFC’s notes contain a covenant that limits SFC’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to create or incur liens. The restrictions may interfere with our ability to obtain new or additional financing or may affect the manner in which we structure such new or additional financing or engage in other business activities, which may significantly limit or harm our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. A default and resulting acceleration of obligations could also result in an event of default and declaration of acceleration under certain of our other existing debt agreements. Such an acceleration of our debt would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to continue as a going concern. A default could also significantly limit our alternatives to refinance both the debt under which the default occurred and other indebtedness. This limitation may significantly restrict our financing options during times of either market distress or our financial distress, which are precisely the times when having financing options is most important.The indenture governing OneMain’s unsecured debt (the OMFH Indenture) contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on OneMain and may limit our ability to integrate OneMain’s operations, including, but not limited to, restrictions on OMFH’s and its restricted subsidiaries’ ability to:•incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock;•make dividend payments or distributions on or purchases of OMFH’s equity interests;•make other restricted payments or investments;•create or permit to exist certain liens;•make certain dispositions of assets;•engage in certain transactions with affiliates;•sell certain securities of our subsidiaries;•in the case of such restricted subsidiaries, incur limitations on the ability to pay dividends or make other payments; and•merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of OneMain’s properties and assets.In addition, the OMFH Indenture includes a change of control repurchase provision which could require us to offer to repurchase all of the outstanding existing notes of OMFH issued thereunder if a change of control occurs and a corporate rating of OMFH is downgraded by both S&P and Moody’s as a result of such change of control. The assessment of our liquidity is based upon significant judgments and estimates that could prove to be materially incorrect.In assessing our current financial position and developing operating plans for the future, management has made significant judgments and estimates with respect to our liquidity, including but not limited to:•our ability to generate sufficient cash to service all of our outstanding debt;•our continued ability to access debt and securitization markets and other sources of funding on favorable terms;•our ability to complete on favorable terms, as needed, additional borrowings, securitizations, finance receivable portfolio sales, or other transactions to support liquidity, and the costs associated with these funding sources, including sales at less than carrying value and limits on the types of assets that can be securitized or sold, which would affect profitability;•the potential for downgrade of our debt by rating agencies, which would have a negative impact on our cost of, and access to, capital;•our ability to comply with our debt covenants;33Table of Contents •the amount of cash expected to be received from our finance receivable portfolio through collections (including prepayments) and receipt of finance charges, which could be materially different than our estimates;•the potential for declining financial flexibility and reduced income should we use more of our assets for securitizations and finance receivable portfolio sales; and•the potential for reduced income due to the possible deterioration of the credit quality of our finance receivable portfolios.Additionally, there are numerous risks to our financial results, liquidity, and capital raising and debt refinancing plans that are not quantified in our current liquidity forecasts. These risks include, but are not limited, to the following:•our inability to grow our personal loan portfolio with adequate profitability to fund operations, loan losses, and other expenses;•our inability to monetize assets including, but not limited to, our access to debt and securitization markets;•our inability to obtain the additional necessary funding to finance our operations;•the effect of federal, state and local laws, regulations, or regulatory policies and practices, including the Dodd-Frank Act (which, among other things, established the CFPB with broad authority to regulate and examine financial institutions), on our ability to conduct business or the manner in which we conduct business, such as licensing requirements, pricing limitations or restrictions on the method of offering products, as well as changes that may result from increased regulatory scrutiny of the sub-prime lending industry;•potential liability relating to real estate and personal loans which we have sold or may sell in the future, or relating to securitized loans, if it is determined that there was a non-curable breach of a warranty made in connection with the transaction;•the potential for increasing costs and difficulty in servicing our loan portfolio as a result of heightened nationwide regulatory scrutiny of loan servicing and foreclosure practices in the industry generally, and related costs that could be passed on to us in connection with the subservicing of our real estate loans that were originated or acquired centrally;•reduced cash receipts as a result of the liquidation of our real estate loan portfolio;•the potential for additional unforeseen cash demands or accelerations of obligations;•reduced income due to loan modifications where the borrower’s interest rate is reduced, principal payments are deferred, or other concessions are made;•the potential for declines or volatility in bond and equity markets; and•the potential effect on us if the capital levels of our regulated and unregulated subsidiaries prove inadequate to support current business plans.We intend to repay indebtedness with one or more of the following activities, among others: finance receivable collections, cash on hand, additional debt financings (particularly new securitizations and possible new issuances and/or debt refinancing transactions), finance receivable portfolio sales, or a combination of the foregoing. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in undertaking any of these activities to support our operations and repay our obligations.The actual outcome of one or more of our plans could be materially different than expected or one or more of our significant judgments or estimates about the potential effects of these risks and uncertainties could prove to be materially incorrect. In the event of such an occurrence, if third-party financing is not available, our liquidity could be substantially and materially affected, and as a result, substantial doubt could exist about our ability to continue as a going concern.34Table of Contents Current ratings could adversely affect our ability to raise capital in the debt markets at attractive rates, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Each of S&P, Moody’s, and Fitch rates SFC’s and OMFH’s debt. Ratings reflect the rating agencies’ opinions of a company’s financial strength, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet our obligations. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating.The table below outlines SFC’s and OMFH’s long-term corporate debt ratings and outlook by rating agencies:As of December 31, 2017 Rating Outlook     SFC:    S&P B StableMoody’s B2 PositiveFitch B Positive     OMFH:    S&P B StableMoody’s B1 PositiveFitch B+ PositiveCurrently, no other OneMain or Springleaf entity has a corporate debt rating, though they may be rated in the future. If SFC’s or OMFH’s current ratings continue in effect or our ratings are downgraded, it will likely increase the interest rate that we would have to pay to raise money in the capital markets, making it more expensive for us to borrow money and adversely impacting our access to capital. As a result, our ratings could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our securitizations may expose us to financing and other risks, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to access the securitization market in the future, which may require us to seek more costly financing.We have securitized, and may in the future securitize, certain of our finance receivables to generate cash to originate or purchase new finance receivables or pay our outstanding indebtedness. In such transactions, we typically convey a pool of finance receivables to a special purpose entity, which, in turn, conveys the finance receivables to a trust (the issuing entity). Concurrently, the trust typically issues non-recourse notes or certificates pursuant to the terms of an indenture or pooling and servicing agreement, which then are transferred to the special purpose entity in exchange for the finance receivables. The securities issued by the trust are secured by the pool of finance receivables. In exchange for the transfer of finance receivables to the issuing entity, we typically receive the cash proceeds from the sale of the trust securities, all residual interests, if any, in the cash flows from the finance receivables after payment of the trust securities, and a 100% beneficial interest in the issuing entity.Although we have successfully completed a number of securitizations since 2012, we can give no assurances that we will be able to complete additional securitizations if the securitization markets become constrained. In addition, the value of any subordinated securities that we may retain in our securitizations might be reduced or, in some cases, eliminated as a result of an adverse change in economic conditions.SFC, OMFG, and OMFH currently act as the servicers with respect to the consumer loan securitization trusts and related series of asset-backed securities. If SFC, OMFG, or OMFH defaults in its servicing obligations, an early amortization event could occur with respect to the relevant asset-backed securities and SFC, OMFG, or OMFH, as applicable, could be replaced as servicer. Servicer defaults include, for example, the failure of the servicer to make any payment, transfer or deposit in accordance with the securitization documents, a breach of representations, warranties or agreements made by the servicer under the securitization documents and the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the servicer. Such an early amortization event could have materially adverse consequences on our liquidity and cost of funds.Rating agencies may also affect our ability to execute a securitization transaction, or increase the costs we expect to incur from executing securitization transactions, not only by deciding not to issue ratings for our securitization transactions, but also by 35Table of Contents altering the criteria and process they follow in issuing ratings. Rating agencies could alter their ratings processes or criteria after we have accumulated finance receivables for securitization in a manner that effectively reduces the value of those finance receivables by increasing our financing costs or otherwise requiring that we incur additional costs to comply with those processes and criteria. We have no ability to control or predict what actions the rating agencies may take.Further, other matters, such as (i) accounting standards applicable to securitization transactions and (ii) capital and leverage requirements applicable to banks and other regulated financial institutions holding residential mortgage-backed securities or other asset-backed securities, could result in decreased investor demand for securities issued through our securitization transactions, or increased competition from other institutions that undertake securitization transactions. In addition, compliance with certain regulatory requirements, including the Dodd-Frank Act and the Investment Company Act, may affect the type of securitizations that we are able to complete.If it is not possible or economical for us to securitize our finance receivables in the future, we would need to seek alternative financing to support our operations and to meet our existing debt obligations, which may be less efficient and more expensive than raising capital via securitizations and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.RISKS RELATED TO OUR ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTUREIf the ownership of our common stock continues to be highly concentrated, it may prevent minority stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and may result in conflicts of interest.The Initial Stockholder, which is primarily owned by a private equity fund managed by an affiliate of Fortress, owned approximately 44% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2017. As a result, the Initial Stockholder may have a significant influence on all matters requiring a stockholder vote, including: the election of directors; mergers, consolidations and acquisitions; the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other decisions affecting our capital structure; the amendment of our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws; and our winding up and dissolution. This concentration of ownership may delay, deter or prevent acts that would be favored by our other stockholders. The interests of the Initial Stockholder may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of our other stockholders. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of us. Also, the Initial Stockholder may seek to cause us to take courses of action that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment in us, but which might involve risks to our other stockholders or adversely affect us or our other stockholders. As a result, the market price of our common stock could decline or stockholders might not receive a premium over the then-current market price of our common stock upon a change in control. In addition, this concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in a company with significant stockholders. On December 27, 2017, SoftBank acquired Fortress. There are no assurances that the acquisition of Fortress by SoftBank will not have an impact on us.On January 3, 2018, the Apollo-Värde Group entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with the Initial Stockholder and the Company to acquire from the Initial Stockholder 54,937,500 shares of our common stock that was issued and outstanding as of such date, representing the entire holdings of our stock beneficially owned by Fortress. See additional information under “Business Overview” in Item 1 of this report. The Share Purchase Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 4, 2018, and such Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 10.1 thereto, is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Upon closing of the Apollo-Värde Transaction, we expect to enter into an Amended and Restated Stockholders’ Agreement, the expected terms of which are described in such Current Report on Form 8-K.  We are a holding company with no operations and rely on our operating subsidiaries to provide us with funds necessary to meet our financial obligations and to pay dividends.We are a holding company with no material direct operations. Our principal assets are the equity interests we directly or indirectly hold in our operating subsidiaries, which own our operating assets. As a result, we are dependent on loans, dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock. Our subsidiaries are legally distinct from us and certain of our subsidiaries are prohibited or restricted from paying dividends or otherwise making funds available to us under certain conditions. For example, our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit their ability to pay dividends or make loans or advances to us, principally to protect policyholders, and certain of our debt agreements limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. In addition, OMFH’s debt covenants restrict its ability to pay dividends. If we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to, or our board may exercise its discretion not to, pay dividends.36Table of Contents We do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock until leverage targets are met.We have no plans to pay regular dividends on our common stock, and we anticipate that a significant amount of any free cash flow generated from our operations will be utilized to redeem or prepay outstanding indebtedness, and accordingly would not be available for dividends.  See our “Dividend Policy” in Part II - Item 5 of this report for further information. Certain provisions of a stockholders agreement with our Initial Stockholder (the “Stockholders Agreement”), our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws could hinder, delay or prevent a change in control of us, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.Certain provisions of the Stockholders Agreement, our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors or Fortress. These provisions provide for:•a classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms;•removal of directors only for cause and only with the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the voting interest of stockholders entitled to vote (provided, however, that for so long as Fortress and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least 30% of our issued and outstanding common stock (including Fortress’ proportionate interest in shares of our common stock held by the Initial Stockholder), directors may be removed with or without cause with the affirmative vote of a majority of the then issued and outstanding voting interest of stockholders entitled to vote);•provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws prevent stockholders from calling special meetings of our stockholders (provided, however, that for so long as Fortress and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least 20% of our issued and outstanding common stock (including Fortress’s proportionate interest in shares of our common stock held by the Initial Stockholder), any stockholders that collectively beneficially own at least 20% of our issued and outstanding common stock may call special meetings of our stockholders);•advance notice requirements by stockholders with respect to director nominations and actions to be taken at annual meetings;•certain rights to Fortress and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees with respect to the designation of directors for nomination and election to our board of directors, including the ability to appoint a majority of the members of our board of directors, plus one director, for so long as Fortress and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees continue to beneficially own, directly or indirectly at least 30% of our issued and outstanding common stock (including Fortress’s proportionate interest in shares of our common stock held by the Initial Stockholder);•no provision in our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws permits cumulative voting in the election of directors, which means that the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock can elect all the directors standing for election;•our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws only permit action by our stockholders outside a meeting by unanimous written consent, provided, however, that for so long as Fortress and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least 20% of our issued and outstanding common stock (including Fortress’s proportionate interest in shares of our common stock held by the Initial Stockholder), our stockholders may act without a meeting by written consent of a majority of our stockholders; and•under our restated certificate of incorporation, our board of directors has authority to cause the issuance of preferred stock from time to time in one or more series and to establish the terms, preferences and rights of any such series of preferred stock, all without approval of our stockholders. Nothing in our restated certificate of incorporation precludes future issuances without stockholder approval of the authorized but unissued shares of our common stock.In addition, these provisions may make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a tender offer, change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by Fortress, our management or our board of directors. Public stockholders who might desire to participate in these types of transactions may not have an opportunity to do so, even if the transaction is favorable to 37Table of Contents stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to benefit from a change in control or change our management and board of directors and, as a result, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the ability of public stockholders to realize any potential change of control premium.Upon closing of the Apollo-Värde Transaction, we expect to enter into an Amended and Restated Stockholders’ Agreement. See additional information under “Business Overview” in Item 1 of this report. The expected terms of the Amended and Restated Stockholders’ Agreement are described in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 4, 2018, and such Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Certain of our stockholders have the right to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses as us.Fortress and its affiliates, including the Initial Stockholder, engage in other investments and business activities in addition to their ownership of us. Under our restated certificate of incorporation, Fortress and its affiliates, including the Initial Stockholder, have the right, and have no duty to abstain from exercising such right, to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses as us, do business with any of our clients, customers or vendors or employ or otherwise engage any of our officers, directors or employees. If Fortress and its affiliates, including the Initial Stockholder, or any of their officers, directors or employees acquire knowledge of a potential transaction that could be a corporate opportunity, they have no duty, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to offer such corporate opportunity to us, our stockholders or our affiliates.In the event that any of our directors and officers who is also a director, officer or employee of any of Fortress or its affiliates, including the Initial Stockholder, acquires knowledge of a corporate opportunity or is offered a corporate opportunity, provided that this knowledge was not acquired solely in such person’s capacity as our director or officer and such person acts in good faith, then even if Fortress or its affiliates, including the Initial Stockholder, pursues or acquires the corporate opportunity or if Fortress or its affiliates, including the Initial Stockholder, do not present the corporate opportunity to us such person is deemed to have fully satisfied such person’s fiduciary duties owed to us and is not liable to us.Licensing and insurance laws and regulations may delay or impede purchases of our common stock.Certain of the states in which we are licensed to originate loans and the states in which Springleaf and OneMain insurance subsidiaries are domiciled (Indiana and Texas) have laws or regulations which require regulatory approval for the acquisition of “control” of regulated entities. In addition, these Indiana and Texas insurance laws and regulations generally provide that no person may acquire control, directly or indirectly, of a domiciled insurer, unless the person has provided the required information to, and the acquisition is subsequently approved or not disapproved by, the Indiana Department of Insurance and also by the Texas Department of Insurance. Under state insurance laws or regulations, there exists a presumption of “control” when an acquiring party acquires as little as 10% of the voting securities of a regulated entity or of a company which itself controls (directly or indirectly) a regulated entity (the threshold is 10% under the insurance statutes of Indiana and Texas). Therefore, any person acquiring 10% or more of our common stock may need the prior approval of these two state insurance and/or licensing regulators, or a determination from such regulators that “control” has not been acquired, which could significantly delay or otherwise impede their ability to complete such purchase. The Apollo-Värde Transaction may be deemed a change of control for purposes of certain of our state lending and insurance licenses pursuant to which we operate our lending and insurance businesses. Accordingly, we may be required to obtain approvals for the change of control from some state lending or insurance regulators.RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCKThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our stockholders.The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. If the market price of our common stock declines significantly, public stockholders may be unable to resell their shares at or above their purchase price, if at all. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include:•variations in our quarterly or annual operating results;•changes in our earnings estimates (if provided) or differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts;38Table of Contents •the contents of published research reports about us or our industry or the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock in the future;•additions to, or departures of, key management personnel;•any increased indebtedness we may incur in the future;•announcements by us or others and developments affecting us;•actions by institutional stockholders or our Initial Stockholder or Fortress;•litigation and governmental investigations;•changes in market valuations of similar companies;•speculation or reports by the press or investment community with respect to us or our industry in general;•increases in market interest rates that may lead purchasers of our shares to demand a higher yield;•announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments; and•general market, political and economic conditions, including any such conditions and local conditions in the markets in which our borrowers are located.These broad company, market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The stock market in general has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, including in recent months. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.Future offerings of debt or equity securities by us may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.In the future, we may attempt to obtain financing or to further increase our capital resources by issuing additional shares of our common stock or offering debt or other equity securities, including commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior or subordinated notes, debt securities convertible into equity or shares of preferred stock. In particular, we intend to continue to seek opportunities to acquire consumer finance portfolios and/or businesses that engage in consumer finance loan servicing and/or consumer finance loan originations. Future acquisitions could require substantial additional capital in excess of cash from operations. We would expect to finance the capital required for acquisitions through a combination of additional issuances of equity, corporate indebtedness, asset-backed acquisition financing and/or cash from operations.Issuing additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities or securities convertible into equity may dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders at the time of such issuance or reduce the market price of our common stock or both. Upon liquidation, holders of debt securities and preferred shares, if issued, and lenders with respect to other borrowings would receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. Debt securities convertible into equity could be subject to adjustments in the conversion ratio pursuant to which certain events may increase the number of equity securities issuable upon conversion. Preferred shares, if issued, could have a preference with respect to liquidating distributions or a preference with respect to dividend payments that could limit our ability to pay dividends to the holders of our common stock. Our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our common stock bear the risk that our future offerings may reduce the market price of our common stock and dilute their stockholdings in us.39Table of Contents The market price of our common stock could be negatively affected by sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets or the failure to close the Apollo-Värde Transaction. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 44% of our outstanding common stock was held by the Initial Stockholder and, subject to the rights of the Apollo-Värde Group, can be resold into the public markets in the future in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). A decline in the price of our common stock, whether as a result of sale of stock by the Initial Stockholder, the failure to close the Apollo-Värde Transaction or otherwise, might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional common stock or other equity securities.The future issuance of additional common stock in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions or otherwise will dilute all other stockholdings.We have an aggregate of 1,864,395,771 shares of common stock authorized but unissued as of February 14, 2018. We may issue all of these shares of common stock without any action or approval by our stockholders, subject to certain exceptions. We also intend to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and may issue common stock in connection with these acquisitions. Any common stock issued in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions, the exercise of outstanding stock options or otherwise would dilute the percentage ownership held by our existing shareholders.Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable reports and prevent fraud.We believe that a control system, no matter how well designed and managed, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. We may not be able to identify all significant deficiencies and/or material weaknesses in our internal control in the future, and our failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects"
1,OMF,ONEMAIN HOLDINGS INC,2017-02-21,"Risk Factors
.    We face a variety of risks that are inherent in our business. Accordingly, you should carefully consider the following discussion of risks in addition to the other information regarding our business provided in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC. These risks are subject to contingencies which may or may not occur, and we are not able to express a view on the likelihood of any such contingency occurring. New risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our business or financial performance.RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSOur consolidated results of operations and financial condition and our borrowers’ ability to make payments on their loans have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by economic conditions and other factors that we cannot control.Uncertainty and negative trends in general economic conditions in the United States and abroad, including significant tightening of credit markets and a general decline in the value of real property, historically have created a difficult operating 14Table of Contentsenvironment for our businesses and other companies in our industries. Many factors, including factors that are beyond our control, may impact our consolidated results of operations or financial condition and/or affect our borrowers’ willingness or capacity to make payments on their loans. These factors include: unemployment levels, housing markets, energy costs and interest rates; events such as natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, catastrophes, major medical expenses, divorce or death that affect our borrowers; and the quality of the collateral underlying our receivables. If we experience an economic downturn or if the U.S. economy is unable to continue or sustain its recovery from the most recent economic downturn, or if we become affected by other events beyond our control, we may experience a significant reduction in revenues, earnings and cash flows, difficulties accessing capital and a deterioration in the value of our investments. We may also become exposed to increased credit risk from our customers and third parties who have obligations to us.Moreover, our customers are primarily non-prime borrowers. Accordingly, such borrowers have historically been, and may in the future become, more likely to be affected, or more severely affected, by adverse macroeconomic conditions. If our borrowers default under a finance receivable held directly by us, we will bear a risk of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral, if any, and the outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest of the finance receivable, which could adversely affect our cash flow from operations. In addition, foreclosure of a real estate loan (part of our legacy real estate loan portfolio) is an expensive and lengthy process that can negatively affect our anticipated return on the foreclosed loan. The cost to service our loans may also increase without a corresponding increase in our finance charge income.Also, certain geographic concentrations of our loan portfolio may occur or increase as we adjust our risk and loss tolerance and strategy to achieve our profitability goals. Any geographic concentration may expose us to an increased risk of loss if that geographic region experiences higher unemployment rates than average, natural disasters, weak economic conditions, or other adverse economic factors that disproportionately affect that region. See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for quantification of our largest concentrations of net finance receivables.If aspects of our business, including the quality of our finance receivables portfolio or our borrowers, are significantly affected by economic changes or any other conditions in the future, we cannot be certain that our policies and procedures for underwriting, processing and servicing loans will adequately adapt to such changes. If we fail to adapt to changing economic conditions or other factors, or if such changes affect our borrowers’ willingness or capacity to repay their loans, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity would be materially adversely affected.There are risks associated with the acquisition or sale of assets or businesses or the formation, termination or operation of joint ventures or other strategic alliances or arrangements, including the possibility of increased delinquencies and losses, difficulties with integrating loans into our servicing platform and disruption to our ongoing business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.In the future, we may acquire assets or businesses, including large portfolios of finance receivables, either through the direct purchase of such assets or the purchase of the equity of a company with such a portfolio. Since we will not have originated or serviced the loans we acquire, we may not be aware of legal or other deficiencies related to origination or servicing, and our review of the portfolio prior to purchase may not uncover those deficiencies. Further, we may have limited recourse against the seller of the portfolio.The ability to integrate and successfully service newly acquired loan portfolios will depend in large part on the success of our development and integration of expanded servicing capabilities, including additional personnel. We may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction if the integration process takes longer, or is more costly, than expected. Our failure to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating the acquired portfolios with our current business or otherwise to realize any of the anticipated benefits of the transaction could impair our operations. In addition, the integration of future large portfolio or other asset or business acquisitions and the formation, termination or operation of joint ventures or other strategic alliances or arrangements are complex, time-consuming and expensive processes that, without proper planning and effective and timely implementation, could significantly disrupt our business.Potential difficulties we may encounter in connection with these transactions and arrangements include, but are not limited to, the following:•the integration of the assets or business into our information technology platforms and servicing systems;•the quality of servicing during any interim servicing period after we purchase a portfolio but before we assume servicing obligations from the seller or its agents;15Table of Contents•the disruption to our ongoing businesses and distraction of our management teams from ongoing business concerns;•incomplete or inaccurate files and records;•the retention of existing customers;•the creation of uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems;•the occurrence of unanticipated expenses; and•potential unknown liabilities associated with the transactions, including legal liability related to origination and servicing prior to the acquisition.For example, in some cases loan files and other information (including servicing records) may be incomplete or inaccurate. If our employees are unable to access customer information easily, or if we are unable to produce originals or copies of documents or accurate information about the loans, collections could be affected significantly, and we may not be able to enforce our right to collect in some cases. Similarly, collections could be affected by any changes to our collection practices, the restructuring of any key servicing functions, transfer of files and other changes that would result from our assumption of the servicing of the acquired portfolios.The anticipated benefits and synergies of our future acquisitions will assume a successful integration, and will be based on projections, which are inherently uncertain, as well as other assumptions. Even if integration is successful, anticipated benefits and synergies may not be achieved.There are risks associated with our ability to expand our centralized loan servicing capabilities through integration of the Springleaf and OneMain servicing facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.A key part of our efforts to expand our centralized loan servicing capacity will depend in large part on the success of management’s efforts to integrate the Springleaf and OneMain servicing facilities. We may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of these facilities if the integration process takes longer, or is more costly, than expected. Our failure to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating these facilities with our current business or to realize other anticipated benefits could impair our operations. In addition, the integration is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process that, without proper planning and effective and timely implementation, could significantly disrupt our business. Potential difficulties we may encounter during the integration process may include, but are not limited to, the following:•the integration of the personnel with certain of our management teams, strategies, operations, products and services;•the integration of the physical facilities with our information technology platforms and servicing systems; and•the disruption to our ongoing businesses and distraction of our management teams from ongoing business concerns.Our recent underwriting changes and strategy of increasing the proportion of secured loan originations within our loan portfolio may lead to declines in, or slower growth than anticipated of, our personal loan net finance receivables and yield, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and growth prospects.During the third quarter of 2016, in response to an increase in unsecured credit availability for our target customer base from online lenders and various other unsecured credit providers, as well as an increase in our early stage 30-89 day delinquencies for loans originated in 2016, we tightened our underwriting criteria for unsecured personal loans to lower credit tier customers. As a result of these changes to our underwriting criteria, we are generally not underwriting new personal loans to this segment of our customer base absent collateral. We have also continued to execute on our strategy of increasing the proportion of our loan originations that are secured loans, particularly within the former OneMain branches where secured loan originations have historically represented a smaller proportion of total loan originations than those of the former Springleaf branches. Secured loans typically carry lower yields relative to unsecured personal loans. If we are unable to successfully convert lower credit tier customers to our secured loan products or otherwise increase new originations of secured personal loans, this will adversely affect our ability to grow personal loan net finance receivables. In addition, as secured loans continue to represent a larger proportion of our loan portfolio, our yields may be lower than our historical yields in prior periods.16Table of ContentsIf our estimates of finance receivable losses are not adequate to absorb actual losses, our provision for finance receivable losses would increase, which would adversely affect our results of operations.We maintain an allowance for finance receivable losses. To estimate the appropriate level of allowance for finance receivable losses, we consider known and relevant internal and external factors that affect finance receivable collectability, including the total amount of finance receivables outstanding, historical finance receivable charge-offs, our current collection patterns, and economic trends. Our methodology for establishing our allowance for finance receivable losses is based on the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification 450, Contingencies, and, in part, on our historic loss experience. If customer behavior changes as a result of economic conditions and if we are unable to predict how the unemployment rate, housing foreclosures, and general economic uncertainty may affect our allowance for finance receivable losses, our provision may be inadequate. Our allowance for finance receivable losses is an estimate, and if actual finance receivable losses are materially greater than our allowance for finance receivable losses, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Neither state regulators nor federal regulators regulate our allowance for finance receivable losses.In June of 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This ASU significantly changes the way that entities will be required to measure credit losses. The new standard requires that the estimated credit loss be based upon an “expected credit loss” approach rather than the “incurred loss” approach currently required. The new approach will require entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable forecasts of collectability. It is anticipated that the expected credit loss model may require earlier recognition of credit losses than the incurred loss approach. This ASU will become effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2020. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2019. We believe the adoption of this ASU will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for more information on this new accounting standard.Our risk management efforts may not be effective.We could incur substantial losses and our business operations could be disrupted if we are unable to effectively identify, manage, monitor, and mitigate financial risks, such as credit risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk, liquidity risk, and other market-related risks, as well as operational risks related to our business, assets and liabilities. To the extent our models used to assess the creditworthiness of potential borrowers do not adequately identify potential risks, the valuations produced would not adequately represent the risk profile of the borrower and could result in a riskier finance receivable profile than originally identified. Our risk management policies, procedures, and techniques, including our scoring technology, may not be sufficient to identify all of the risks we are exposed to, mitigate the risks we have identified or identify concentrations of risk or additional risks to which we may become subject in the future.Our branch loan approval process is decentralized, which may result in variability of loan structures, and could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our branch finance receivable origination process is decentralized. We train our employees individually on-site in the branch to make loans that conform to our underwriting standards. Such training includes critical aspects of state and federal regulatory compliance, cash handling, account management and customer relations. In certain circumstances, subject to approval by district managers and/or directors of operations in certain cases, our branch officers have the authority to approve and structure loans within broadly written underwriting guidelines rather than having all loan terms approved centrally. As a result, there may be variability in finance receivable structure (e.g., whether or not collateral is taken for the loan) and loan portfolios among branch offices or regions, even when underwriting policies are followed. Moreover, we cannot be certain that every loan is made in accordance with our underwriting standards and rules, and we have in the past experienced some instances of loans extended that varied from our underwriting standards. The nature of our approval process could adversely affect our operating results and variances in underwriting standards and lack of supervision could expose us to greater delinquencies and charge-offs than we have historically experienced, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Changes in market conditions, including rising interest rates, could adversely affect the rate at which our borrowers prepay their loans and the value of our finance receivables portfolio, as well as increase our financing cost, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Changing market conditions, including but not limited to, changes in interest rates, the availability of credit, the relative economic vitality of the area in which our borrowers and their assets are located, changes in tax laws, other opportunities for investment available to our customers, homeowner mobility, and other economic, social, geographic, demographic, and legal 17Table of Contentsfactors beyond our control, may affect the rates at which our borrowers prepay their loans. Generally, in situations where prepayment rates have slowed, the weighted-average life of our finance receivables has increased. Any increase in interest rates may further slow the rate of prepayment for our finance receivables, which could adversely affect our liquidity by reducing the cash flows from, and the value of, the finance receivables we hold for sale or utilize as collateral in our secured funding transactions.Moreover, the vast majority of our finance receivables are fixed-rate finance receivables, which generally decline in value if interest rates increase. As such, if changing market conditions cause interest rates to increase substantially, the value of our fixed-rate finance receivables could decline. Recent increases in market interest rates have negatively impacted our net interest income and further increases in market interest rates could continue to negatively impact such net interest income, as well as our cash flow from operations and results of operations. Our consumer loans generally bear interest at a fixed rate and, accordingly, we are generally unable to increase the interest rate on such loans to offset any increases in our cost of funds as market interest rates increase. Additionally, because we are subject to applicable legal and regulatory restrictions in certain jurisdictions that limit the maximum interest rate that we may charge on certain of our consumer loans, our yield, as well as our cash flows from operations and results of operations, could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to increase the interest rates charged on newly originated loans to offset any increases in our cost of funds as market interest rates increase. Accordingly, any increase in interest rates could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We may be required to indemnify, or repurchase finance receivables from, purchasers of finance receivables that we have sold or securitized, or which we will sell or securitize in the future, if our finance receivables fail to meet certain criteria or characteristics or under other circumstances, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.In 2016, we sold $1.6 billion of our interests in the SpringCastle Portfolio as a result of the SpringCastle Interests Sale, $602 million of personal loans in connection with the Lendmark Sale (as defined in “Recent Developments and Outlook” in Part II - Item 7 of this report), and $308 million of our legacy real estate loan portfolio. We securitized $9.5 billion of our consumer loan portfolio as of December 31, 2016. In addition, we sold $6.4 billion of our legacy real estate loan portfolio in 2014. The documents governing our finance receivable sales and securitizations contain provisions that require us to indemnify the purchasers of securitized finance receivables, or to repurchase the affected finance receivables, under certain circumstances. While our sale and securitization documents vary, they generally contain customary provisions that may require us to repurchase finance receivables if:•our representations and warranties concerning the quality and characteristics of the finance receivable are inaccurate;•there is borrower fraud; or•we fail to comply, at the individual finance receivable level or otherwise, with regulatory requirements in connection with the origination and servicing of the finance receivables.As a result of the current market environment, we believe that many purchasers of real estate loans (including through securitizations) are particularly aware of the conditions under which originators must indemnify purchasers or repurchase finance receivables, and would benefit from enforcing any repurchase remedies that they may have. At its extreme, our exposure to repurchases or our indemnification obligations under our representations and warranties could include the current unpaid balance of all finance receivables that we have sold or securitized and which are not subject to settlement agreements with purchasers.The risk of loss on the finance receivables that we have securitized is recognized in our allowance for finance receivable losses since all of our consumer loan securitizations are recorded on-balance sheet. If we are required to indemnify purchasers or repurchase finance receivables that we sell that result in losses that exceed our reserve for sales recourse, or recognize losses on securitized finance receivables that exceed our recorded allowance for finance receivable losses associated with our securitizations, this could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our insurance operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including claims, catastrophic events, underwriting risks and dependence on a primary distribution channel.Insurance claims and policyholder liabilities are difficult to predict and may exceed the related reserves set aside for claims (losses) and associated expenses for claims adjudication (loss adjustment expenses). Additionally, events such as hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes, pandemic disease, cyber security breaches and other types of catastrophes, and prolonged economic 18Table of Contentsdownturns, could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Other risks relating to our insurance operations include changes to laws and regulations applicable to us, as well as changes to the regulatory environment. Examples include changes to laws or regulations affecting capital and reserve requirements; frequency and type of regulatory monitoring and reporting; consumer privacy, use of customer data and data security; benefits or loss ratio requirements; insurance producer licensing or appointment requirements; required disclosures to consumers; and collateral protection insurance (i.e., insurance some of our lender companies purchase, at the customer’s expense, on that customer’s loan collateral for the periods of time the customer fails to adequately, as required by his loan, insure his collateral). Because our customers do not affirmatively consent to collateral protection insurance at the time it is purchased, and hence do not directly agree to the amount charged for it, regulators may in the future prohibit our insurance companies from providing this insurance to our lending operations. Moreover, our insurance companies are predominately dependent on our lending operations as the primary source of business and product distribution. If our lending operations discontinue offering insurance products, including as a result of regulatory requirements, our insurance operations would basically have no method of distribution for their products.We are a party to various lawsuits and proceedings and may become a party to various lawsuits and proceedings in the future which, if resolved in a manner adverse to us, could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.In the normal course of business, from time to time, we have been named and may be named in the future as a defendant in various legal actions, including governmental investigations, examinations or other proceedings, arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with our business activities. Certain of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages, or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. Some of these proceedings are pending in jurisdictions that permit damage awards disproportionate to the actual economic damages alleged to have been incurred. The continued occurrences of large damage awards in general in the United States, including large punitive damage awards in certain jurisdictions that bear little or no relation to actual economic damages incurred by plaintiffs, create the potential for an unpredictable result in any given proceeding. A large judgment that is adverse to us could cause our reputation to suffer, encourage additional lawsuits against us and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. For additional information regarding pending legal proceedings and other contingencies, see Notes 19 and 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report.If we lose the services of any of our key management personnel, our business could suffer.Our future success significantly depends on the continued service and performance of our key management personnel. Competition for these employees is intense and we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel. We do not maintain any “key man” or other related insurance. The loss of the service of members of our senior management or key team members, or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed, could materially harm our business.Employee misconduct could harm us by subjecting us to monetary loss, significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm.Our reputation is critical to maintaining and developing relationships with our existing and potential customers and third parties with whom we do business. There is a risk that our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. For example, if an employee were to engage—or be accused of engaging—in illegal or suspicious activities including fraud or theft, we could suffer direct losses from the activity, and in addition we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial condition, customer relationships, and ability to attract future customers or employees. Employee misconduct could prompt regulators to allege or to determine based upon such misconduct that we have not established adequate supervisory systems and procedures to inform employees of applicable rules or to detect and deter violations of such rules. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent misconduct may not be effective in all cases. Misconduct by our employees, or even unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct, could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business.Current and proposed regulations relating to consumer privacy, data protection and information security could increase our costs.We are subject to a number of federal and state consumer privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations. For example, we are subject to the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which governs the use of personal financial information by financial institutions. Moreover, various federal and state regulatory agencies require us to notify customers in the event of a security breach. Federal and state legislators and regulators are increasingly pursuing new guidance, laws, and regulation. Compliance with current or future customer privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations could result in higher compliance, technology or other operating costs. Any violations of these laws and regulations may 19Table of Contentsrequire us to change our business practices or operational structure, and could subject us to legal claims, monetary penalties, sanctions, and the obligation to indemnify and/or notify customers or take other remedial actions.Significant disruptions in the operation of our information systems could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our business relies heavily on information systems to deliver products and services to our customers, and to manage our ongoing operations. These systems may encounter service disruptions due to system, network or software failure, security breaches, computer viruses, natural disasters or other reasons. There can be no assurance that our policies and procedures addressing these issues will adequately address the disruption. A disruption could impair our ability to offer and process consumer loans, provide customer service, perform collections activities or perform other necessary business activities, which could result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability.Security breaches in our information systems, in the information systems of third parties or in our branches, central servicing facilities, or our internet lending platform could adversely affect our reputation and could subject us to significant costs and regulatory penalties.Our operations rely heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential customer and other information in our computer systems and networks. Our branch offices and centralized servicing centers, as well as our administrative and executive offices, are part of an electronic information network that is designed to permit us to originate and track finance receivables and collections, and perform several other tasks that are part of our everyday operations. Our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious code that could result in disruption to our business, or the loss or theft of confidential information, including customer information. Any failure, interruption, or breach in our cyber security, including through employee misconduct or any failure of our back-up systems or failure to maintain adequate security surrounding customer information, could result in reputational harm, disruption in the management of our customer relationships, or the inability to originate, process and service our finance receivable products. Further, any of these cyber security and operational risks could result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to lawsuits by customers for identity theft or other damages resulting from the misuse of their personal information and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, regulators may impose penalties or require remedial action if they identify weaknesses in our security systems, and we may be required to incur significant costs to increase our cyber security to address any vulnerabilities that may be discovered or to remediate the harm caused by any security breaches. As part of our business, we may share confidential customer information and proprietary information with clients, vendors, service providers, and business partners. The information systems of these third parties may be vulnerable to security breaches and we may not be able to ensure that these third parties have appropriate security controls in place to protect the information we share with them. If our confidential information is intercepted, stolen, misused, or mishandled while in possession of a third party, it could result in reputational harm to us, loss of customer business, and additional regulatory scrutiny, and it could expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Although we have insurance that is intended to cover certain losses from such events, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate or available.Our branch offices and centralized servicing centers have physical customer records necessary for day-to-day operations that contain extensive confidential information about our customers, including financial and personally identifiable information. We also retain physical records in various storage locations outside of these locations. The loss or theft of customer information and data from our branch offices, central servicing facilities, or other storage locations could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and penalties, and could expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, if we cannot locate original documents (or copies, in some cases), we may not be able to collect on the finance receivables for which we do not have documents.We may not be able to make technological improvements as quickly as some of our competitors, which could harm our ability to compete with our competitors and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial and lending institutions to better serve customers and reduce costs. Our future success and, in particular, the success of our centralized operations, will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services as quickly as some of our competitors or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological 20Table of Contentschange affecting the financial services industry could harm our ability to compete with our competitors and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We could face environmental liability and costs for damage caused by hazardous waste (including the cost of cleaning up contaminated property) if we foreclose upon or otherwise take title to real estate pledged as collateral.If a real estate loan goes into default, we may start foreclosure proceedings in appropriate circumstances, which could result in our taking title to the mortgaged real estate. We also consider alternatives to foreclosure, such as “short sales,” where we do not take title to mortgaged real estate. There is a risk that toxic or hazardous substances could be found on property after we take title. In addition, we own certain properties through which we operate our business, such as the buildings at our headquarters and certain servicing facilities. As the owner of any property where hazardous waste is present, we could be held liable for clean-up and remediation costs, as well as damages for any personal injuries or property damage caused by the condition of the property. We may also be responsible for these costs if we are in the chain of title for the property, even if we were not responsible for the contamination and even if the contamination is not discovered until after we have sold the property. Costs related to these activities and damages could be substantial. Although we have policies and procedures in place to investigate properties for potential hazardous substances before taking title to properties, these reviews may not always uncover potential environmental hazards.We ceased real estate lending and the purchase of retail finance contracts in 2012 and are in the process of liquidating these portfolios, which subjects us to certain risks which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity if we do not effectively manage such risks.In connection with our plan for strategic growth and new focus on consumer lending, we have engaged in a number of restructuring initiatives, including, but not limited to, ceasing real estate lending, ceasing purchasing retail sales contracts and revolving retail accounts from the sale of consumer goods and services by retail merchants, closing certain of our branches and reducing our workforce.Since terminating our real estate lending business at the beginning of 2012, which historically accounted for in excess of 50% of the interest income of our business, and ceasing retail sales purchases, we have been liquidating these legacy portfolios. In 2014, we entered into a series of transactions relating to the sales of our beneficial interests in our non-core real estate loans, the related servicing of these loans, and the sales of certain performing and non-performing real estate loans, which substantially completed our plan to liquidate our non-core real estate loans. Consequently, as of December 31, 2016, our real estate loans held for investment and held for sale totaled $144 million and $153 million, respectively. Due to the fact that we are no longer able to offer our remaining legacy real estate lending customers the same range of loan restructuring alternatives in delinquency situations that we may historically have extended to them, such customers may be less able, and less likely, to repay their loans.Moreover, if we fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the restructuring of our business and associated liquidation of our legacy portfolios, we may experience an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.As part of our growth strategy, we have committed to building our consumer lending business. If we are unable to successfully implement our growth strategy, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.We believe that our future success depends on our ability to implement our growth strategy, the key feature of which has been to shift our primary focus to originating consumer loans as well as acquiring portfolios of consumer loans, pursuing acquisitions of companies, and/or establishing joint ventures or other strategic alliances or arrangements. We have also recently expanded into internet lending through our centralized operations.We may not be able to implement our new strategy successfully, and our success depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:•address the risks associated with our focus on personal loans (including direct auto loans), including, but not limited to consumer demand for finance receivables, and changes in economic conditions and interest rates;•address the risks associated with the new centralized method of originating and servicing our internet loans through our centralized operations, which represents a departure from our traditional high-touch branch-based servicing function and includes the potential for higher default and delinquency rates;21Table of Contents•integrate, and develop the expertise required to capitalize on, our centralized operations;•obtain regulatory approval in connection with our internet lending;•obtain regulatory approval in connection with the acquisition of consumer loan portfolios and/or companies in the business of selling consumer loans or related products;•comply with regulations in connection with doing business and offering loan products over the Internet, including various state and federal e-signature rules mandating that certain disclosures be made and certain steps be followed in order to obtain and authenticate e-signatures, with which we have limited experience;•finance future growth;•successfully source, underwrite and integrate new acquisitions of loan portfolios and other businesses; and•successfully integrate Springleaf and OneMain.In order for us to realize the benefits associated with our new focus on originating and servicing consumer loans and grow our business, we must implement our strategic objectives in a timely and cost-effective manner as well as anticipate and address any risks to which we may become subject. In any event, we may not realize these benefits for many years, or our competitors may introduce more compelling products, services or enhancements. If we are not able to realize the benefits, or if we do not do so in a timely manner, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be negatively affected which would have a material adverse effect on business.RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY AND REGULATIONWe operate in a highly competitive market, and we cannot ensure that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.The consumer finance industry is highly competitive. Our profitability depends, in large part, on our ability to originate finance receivables. We compete with other consumer finance companies as well as other types of financial institutions that offer similar products and services in originating finance receivables. Some of these competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we possess. Some competitors may also have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that may not be available to us. While banks and credit card companies have decreased their lending to non-prime customers in recent years, there is no assurance that such lenders will not resume those lending activities. Further, because of increased regulatory pressure on payday lenders, many of those lenders are starting to make more traditional installment consumer loans in order to reduce regulatory scrutiny of their practices, which could increase competition in markets in which we operate. In addition, in July 2013, the Dodd-Frank Act’s three-year moratorium on banks affiliated with non-financial businesses expired. When the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted in 2010, a moratorium was imposed that prohibited the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation from approving deposit insurance for certain banks controlled by non-financial commercial enterprises. The expiration of the moratorium could result in an increase of traditionally non-financial enterprises entering the banking space, which could increase the number of our competitors. There can be no assurance that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our businesses are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business.Our businesses are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, and various state authorities regulate and supervise our insurance operations. The laws under which a substantial amount of our consumer and real estate businesses are conducted generally: provide for state licensing of lenders and, in some cases, licensing of employees involved in real estate loan modifications; impose limits on the term of a finance receivable, amounts, interest rates and charges on the finance receivables; regulate whether and under what circumstances insurance and other ancillary products may be offered to consumers in connection with a lending transaction; regulate the manner in which we use personal data; and provide for other consumer protections. We are also subject to extensive servicing regulations which we must comply with when servicing our legacy real estate loans and the SpringCastle Portfolio, and which we will have to comply with if we acquire loan portfolios in the future and assume the servicing obligations for the acquired loans or other financial assets. The extent of state regulation of our insurance business varies by product and by jurisdiction, but relates primarily to the following: licensing; conduct of business; periodic examination of the affairs of insurers; form and content of required financial reports; standards of solvency; limitations on dividend payments and other related party transactions; types of products offered; approval of policy forms and 22Table of Contentspremium rates; permissible investments; deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders; reserve requirements for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes; and claims processing.All of our operations are subject to regular examination by state and federal regulators, and as a whole, our entities are subject to several hundred regulatory examinations in a given year. These examinations may result in requirements to change our policies or practices, and in some cases, we are required to pay monetary fines or make reimbursements to customers. Many state regulators and some federal regulators have indicated an intention to pool their resources in order to conduct examinations of licensed entities, including us, at the same time (referred to as a “multi-state” examination). This could result in more in-depth examinations, which could be more costly and lead to more significant enforcement actions.The CFPB has outlined several proposals under consideration for the purpose of requiring lenders to take steps to ensure consumers have the financial ability to repay their loans. The proposals under consideration would require lenders to determine at the outset of each loan whether a consumer can afford to borrow from the lender and would require that lenders comply with various restrictions designed to ensure that consumers can affordably repay their debt to the lender. To date, the proposals under consideration by the CFPB have not been adopted. If adopted, the proposals outlined by the CFPB may require the Company to make significant changes to its lending practices to develop compliant procedures.We are also subject to potential enforcement, supervisions and other actions that may be brought by state attorneys general or other state enforcement authorities and other governmental agencies. Any such actions could subject us to civil money penalties, customer remediation and increased compliance costs, as well as damage our reputation and brand and could limit or prohibit our ability to offer certain products and services or engage in certain business practices.The Department of Defense has made changes to the regulations that have been promulgated as a result of the Military Lending Act. Effective October 3, 2016, we are subject to the limitations of the Military Lending Act, which places a 36% limitation on all fees, charges, interest rate and credit and non-credit insurance premiums for loans made to members of the military or their dependents. We are also no longer able to make non-purchase money loans secured by motor vehicles to service members and their dependents.We are also subject to potential changes in state law, which could lower the interest-rate limit that non-depository financial institutions may charge for consumer loans or could expand the definition of interest under state law to include the cost of ancillary products, such as insurance.We believe that we maintain all material licenses and permits required for our current operations and are in substantial compliance with all applicable federal, state and local regulations, but we may not be able to maintain all requisite licenses and permits, and the failure to satisfy those and other regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, changes in laws or regulations applicable to us could subject us to additional licensing, registration and other regulatory requirements in the future or could adversely affect our ability to operate or the manner in which we conduct business.A material failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in regulatory actions, including substantial fines or penalties, lawsuits and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.For more information with respect to the regulatory framework affecting our businesses, see “Business—Regulation” included in Part I - Item 1 of this report.The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act and the creation of the CFPB significantly increases our regulatory costs and burdens.The Dodd-Frank Act was adopted in 2010. This law and the related regulations affect our operations in terms of increased oversight of financial services products by the CFPB, and the imposition of restrictions on the allowable terms for certain consumer credit transactions. The CFPB has significant authority to implement and enforce federal consumer finance laws, including the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act and new requirements for financial services products provided for in the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the authority to identify and prohibit unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provides the CFPB with broad supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over various consumer financial products and services, including the ability to require reimbursements and other payments to customers for alleged legal violations, and to impose significant penalties, as well as injunctive relief that prohibits lenders from engaging in allegedly unlawful practices. Further, state attorneys general and state regulators are authorized to bring civil actions to enforce certain consumer protection provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The 23Table of ContentsDodd-Frank Act and accompanying regulations are being phased in over time, and while some regulations have been promulgated, many others have not yet been proposed or finalized. We cannot predict the terms of all of the final regulations, their intended consequences or how such regulations will affect us or our industry.The CFPB currently has supervisory authority over our real estate servicing activities, and likely will have supervisory authority over our consumer lending business. It also has the authority to bring enforcement actions for violations of laws over which it has jurisdiction regardless of whether it has supervisory authority for a given product or service. Effective in January 2014, the CFPB finalized mortgage servicing regulations, which makes it more difficult and expensive to service mortgages. The Dodd-Frank Act also gives the CFPB supervisory authority over entities that are designated as “larger participants” in certain financial services markets, including consumer installment loans and related products. The CFPB has not yet promulgated regulations that designate “larger participants” for consumer finance companies. If we are designated as a “larger participant” for this market, we also will be subject to supervision and examination by the CFPB with respect to our consumer loan business. The CFPB has published regulations for “larger participants” in the market of auto finance, and we have been designated as a larger participant in this market. The CFPB’s broad supervisory and enforcement powers could affect our business and operations significantly in terms of increased operating and regulatory compliance costs, and limits on the types of products we offer and the manner in which they are offered, among other things. See “Business—Regulation” in Part I - Item 1 of this report for further information on the CFPB.The CFPB and certain state regulators have taken action against select lenders regarding the marketing of products offered by the lenders in connection with their loans. The products included debt cancellation/suspension products written by the lenders which forgave a borrower’s debt or monthly minimum payment upon the occurrence of certain events in the life of the borrower (e.g., death, disability, marriage, divorce, birth of a child, etc.). We sell insurance and non-insurance products in connection with our loans. While insurance products are actively regulated by state insurance departments, sales of insurance and non-insurance products could be challenged in a similar manner by the CFPB or state consumer lending regulators.Our use of third-party vendors is subject to increasing regulatory attention.Recently, the CFPB and other regulators have issued regulatory guidance that has focused on the need for financial institutions to perform increased due diligence and ongoing monitoring of third-party vendor relationships, thus increasing the scope of management involvement and decreasing the benefit that we receive from using third-party vendors. Moreover, if our regulators conclude that we have not met the heightened standards for oversight of our third-party vendors, we could be subject to enforcement actions, civil monetary penalties, supervisory orders to cease and desist or other remedial actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.U.S. tax code reform proposals, if enacted into law, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.The new presidential administration and several members of the U.S. Congress have indicated significant reform of various aspects of the U.S. tax code as a top legislative priority. A number of proposals for tax reform, including significant changes to corporate tax provisions, are currently under consideration. Such changes could have a material adverse impact on our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows, depending on the nature and extent of any changes to the U.S. tax code that are ultimately enacted into law. Additionally, changes to the U.S. tax code could more broadly impact the U.S. economy, which could potentially result in a material adverse impact on the demand for our products and services and the ability of our customers to repay their loans. There is a substantial lack of clarity around the likelihood, timing and details of any such tax reform and the impact of any potential tax reform on us or an investment in our securities. We cannot predict if or when any of these proposals to reform the U.S. tax code will be enacted into law and, accordingly, no assurance can be given as to whether or to what extent any changes to the U.S. tax code will impact us or our customers or our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.We purchase and sell finance receivables, including charged off receivables and receivables where the borrower is in default. This practice could subject us to heightened regulatory scrutiny, which may expose us to legal action, cause us to incur losses and/or limit or impede our collection activity.As part of our business model, we purchase and sell finance receivables. Although the borrowers for some of these finance receivables are current on their payments, other borrowers may be in default (including in bankruptcy) or the debt may have been charged off as uncollectible. The CFPB and other regulators have recently significantly increased their scrutiny of the purchase and sale of debt, and collections practices undertaken by purchasers of debt, especially delinquent and charged off debt. The CFPB has scrutinized sellers of debt for not maintaining sufficient documentation to support and verify the validity or amount of the debt. It has also scrutinized debt collectors for, among other things, their collection tactics, attempting to collect 24Table of Contentsdebts that no longer are valid, misrepresenting the amount of the debt and not having sufficient documentation to verify the validity or amount of the debt. Our purchases or sales of receivables could expose us to lawsuits or fines by regulators if we do not have sufficient documentation to support and verify the validity and amount of the finance receivables underlying these transactions, or if we or purchasers of our finance receivables use collection methods that are viewed as unfair or abusive. In addition, our collections could suffer and we may incur additional expenses if we are required to change collection practices or stop collecting on certain debts as a result of a lawsuit or action on the part of regulators.The Dodd-Frank Act also may adversely affect the securitization market because it requires, among other things, that a securitizer must retain at least a 5% economic interest in the credit risk of the securitized assets. Furthermore, sponsors are prohibited from diluting the required risk retention by dividing the economic interest among multiple parties, or hedging or transferring the credit risk the sponsor is required to maintain. Moreover, the SEC’s significant changes to Regulation AB could result in sweeping changes to the commercial and residential mortgage loan securitization markets, as well as to the market for the re-securitization of mortgage-backed securities.Rules relating to securitizations rated by nationally-recognized statistical rating agencies require that the findings of any third-party due diligence service providers be made publicly available at least five (5) business days prior to the first sale of securities, which may lead us to incur additional costs in connection with each securitization.On September 19, 2011, the SEC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking intended to implement the prohibition regarding material conflicts of interest relating to certain securitizations pursuant to Section 621 of the Dodd-Frank Act. At this time, we cannot predict what form the final rules and any related interpretive guidance from the SEC will take, or whether such rules would materially impact our business.A certain amount of the rule-making under the Dodd-Frank Act remains to be done. As a result, the complete impact of the Dodd-Frank Act remains uncertain. It is not clear what form some of these remaining regulations will ultimately take, or how our business will be affected. No assurance can be given that the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations or any other new legislative changes enacted will not have a significant impact on our business.For more information with respect to the regulatory framework affecting our businesses, see “Business—Regulation” included in Part I - Item 1 of this report.Investment Company Act considerations could affect our method of doing business.We intend to continue conducting our business operations so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”). We are a holding company that conducts its businesses primarily through wholly owned subsidiaries and are not an investment company because our subsidiaries are primarily engaged in the non-investment company business of consumer finance. Certain of our subsidiaries rely on exemptions from registration as an investment company, including pursuant to Sections 3(c)(4) and 3(c)(5) of the Investment Company Act. We rely on guidance published by the SEC staff or on our analyses of such guidance to determine our subsidiaries’ qualification under these and other exemptions. To the extent that the SEC staff publishes new or different guidance with respect to these matters, we may be required to adjust our business operations accordingly. Any additional guidance from the SEC staff could provide additional flexibility to us, or it could inhibit our ability to conduct our business operations. There can be no assurance that the laws and regulations governing the Investment Company Act status of real estate or real estate related assets or SEC guidance regarding Investment Company Act exemptions for real estate assets will not change in a manner that adversely affects our operations. If we fail to qualify for an exemption or exception from the Investment Company Act in the future, we could be required to restructure our activities or the activities of our subsidiaries, which could negatively affect us. In addition, if we or one or more of our subsidiaries fail to maintain compliance with the applicable exemptions or exceptions and we do not have another basis available to us on which we may avoid registration, and we were therefore required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we would become subject to substantial regulation with respect to our capital structure, management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons, holdings, and other matters, which could have an adverse effect on us.Real estate loan servicing and loan modifications have come under increasing scrutiny from government officials and others, which could make servicing our legacy real estate loan portfolio more costly and difficult.Real estate loan servicers have recently come under increasing scrutiny. In addition, some states and municipalities have passed laws that impose additional duties on foreclosing lenders and real estate loan servicers, such as mandatory mediation or extensive requirements for maintenance of vacant properties, which, in some cases, begin even before a lender has taken title to property. These additional requirements can delay foreclosures, make it uneconomical to foreclose on mortgaged real estate or 25Table of Contentsresult in significant additional costs, which could materially adversely affect the value of our portfolio. The CFPB finalized mortgage servicing regulations that became effective in January 2014, which makes it more difficult and expensive to service real estate loans.The U.S. Government has implemented a number of federal programs to assist homeowners, including the Home Affordable Modification Program (“HAMP”), which expired on December 31, 2016. Loans subserviced for us by Nationstar Mortgage LLC and Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. were subject to HAMP and were eligible for modification pursuant to HAMP guidelines. We have also implemented proprietary real estate loan modification programs in order to help real estate secured customers remain current on their loans. HAMP, our proprietary loan modification programs and other existing or future legislative or regulatory actions which result in the modification of outstanding real estate loans, may adversely affect the value of, and the returns on, our existing portfolio.RISKS RELATED TO THE ONEMAIN ACQUISITION AND THE LENDMARK SALEWe have incurred substantial transaction fees and costs in connection with the OneMain Acquisition and integration.We have incurred a significant amount of costs in connection with the OneMain Acquisition and integration, including legal, accounting and other expenses. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the course of the integration of the businesses of Springleaf and OneMain. We cannot be certain that the elimination of duplicative costs or the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the two businesses will offset the transaction and integration costs in the near term, or at all.The OneMain Acquisition may not achieve its intended results, and we may be unable to successfully integrate Springleaf’s and OneMain’s operations.We acquired OneMain with the expectation that the OneMain Acquisition will result in various benefits, including, among other things, cost savings and operating efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the OneMain Acquisition is subject to a number of uncertainties (many of which are outside our control), including whether our business and the business of OneMain can be integrated in an efficient and effective manner.The integration of OneMain is a complex, costly and time-consuming process, and the significant size and scale of OneMain increases the risks to which we are subject relative to other acquired businesses. Such risks include the following, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the OneMain Acquisition:•The integration process could take longer than anticipated and result in the loss of valuable employees, additional and unforeseen expenses, the disruption of our ongoing business, processes and systems, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, policies and compensation arrangements.•There may be increased risk due to integrating financial reporting and internal control systems.•Difficulties in combining operations of Springleaf and OneMain could also result in the loss of contract counterparties or other persons with whom Springleaf or OneMain conduct business and potential disputes or litigation with contract counterparties or other persons with whom Springleaf or OneMain conduct business.•The integration process could result in the diversion of management and employee attention and resources or other disruptions that may adversely affect our ability to grow our business, pursue loan monitoring and collection activities, or achieve the anticipated benefits of the OneMain Acquisition.If we experience difficulties or delays with the OneMain integration process, or if our assumptions underlying expectations regarding the OneMain Acquisition prove to be inaccurate, the anticipated benefits, expense savings and synergies may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, increased credit losses or decreases in the amount of expected revenues, any of which could adversely affect our future business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. Our results of operations following the OneMain Acquisition could also be adversely affected by any issues attributable to either Springleaf’s or OneMain’s operations that arise or are based on events or actions that occurred prior to the closing of the OneMain Acquisition.Additionally, since the closing of the OneMain Acquisition, we remain reliant on Citigroup, the former parent company of OMFH, to provide certain operational services and support to OneMain, and a failure by Citigroup to perform such services 26Table of Contentscould materially increase our costs or disrupt our business, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.If the goodwill and other intangible assets that we recorded in connection with the OneMain Acquisition becomes impaired, it could have a negative impact on our profitability.Goodwill represents the amount of acquisition cost over the fair value of net assets we acquired in connection with the OneMain Acquisition. If the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Any such adjustments are reflected in our results of operations in the periods in which the impairments become known. At December 31, 2016, our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $1.4 billion and $492 million, respectively. While we have recorded no impairment charges on our goodwill and other intangible assets during 2016 and 2015, there can be no assurance that our future evaluations of goodwill and other intangible assets will not result in findings of impairment and related write-downs, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.The DOJ may impose additional conditions or penalties relating to the Lendmark Sale that could adversely affect us.Pursuant to the Final Judgment entered into in connection with the Settlement Agreement (as defined in “Recent Developments and Outlook” in Part II - Item 7 of this report), we are subject to various ongoing obligations, including a prohibition on entering into certain employee non-compete agreements and obligations under a transition services agreement with Lendmark Financial Services, LLC (“Lendmark”) dated as of May 2, 2016. Notwithstanding the consummation of the Lendmark Sale (as defined in “Recent Developments and Outlook” in Part II - Item 7 of this report), we could be subject to certain penalties, including but not limited to fines and/or injunctions, in the event we violate the terms of the Final Judgment or Settlement Agreement. There can be no assurance that we will not be assessed fines or penalties or subjected to additional actions by the DOJ.RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESSAn inability to access adequate sources of liquidity may adversely affect our ability to fund operational requirements and satisfy financial obligations.Our ability to access capital and credit was significantly affected by the substantial disruption in the U.S. credit markets and the associated credit rating downgrades on our debt. In addition, the risk of volatility surrounding the global economic system and uncertainty surrounding regulatory reforms, such as the Dodd-Frank Act, continue to create uncertainty around access to the capital markets. Historically, we funded our operations and repaid our debt and other obligations using funds collected from our finance receivable portfolio and new debt issuances. Although market conditions have improved since the financial crisis, our traditional borrowing sources, including our ability to cost-effectively issue large amounts of unsecured debt in the capital markets, particularly issuances of commercial paper, have generally not been available to us. Instead we have primarily raised capital through securitization transactions and, although there can be no assurances that we will be able to complete additional securitizations, we currently expect our near-term sources of capital markets funding to continue to derive from securitization transactions and unsecured debt offerings.If we are unable to complete additional securitization transactions on a timely basis or upon terms acceptable to us or otherwise access adequate sources of liquidity, our ability to fund our own operational requirements and satisfy financial obligations may be adversely affected.Our indebtedness is significant, which could affect our ability to meet our obligations under our debt instruments and could materially and adversely affect our business and ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry.We currently have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2016, we had $14.0 billion of indebtedness outstanding. Interest expense on our indebtedness totaled $856 million in 2016.The amount of indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:•it may require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of the principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, which reduces the funds available for other purposes, including finance receivable originations;27Table of Contents•it could limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing regulatory, business and economic conditions;•it may limit our ability to incur additional borrowings or securitizations for working capital, capital expenditures, business development, debt service requirements, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes, or to refinance our indebtedness;•it may require us to seek to change the maturity, interest rate and other terms of our existing debt;•it may place us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors that are proportionately not as highly leveraged;•it may cause a downgrade of our debt and long-term corporate ratings; and•it may cause us to be more vulnerable to periods of negative or slow growth in the general economy or in our business.In addition, meeting our anticipated liquidity requirements is contingent upon our continued compliance with our existing debt agreements. An event of default or declaration of acceleration under one of our existing debt agreements could also result in an event of default and declaration of acceleration under certain of our other existing debt agreements. Such an acceleration of our debt would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to continue as a going concern. If our debt obligations increase, whether due to the increased cost of existing indebtedness or the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the consequences described above could be magnified.There can be no assurance that we will be able to repay or refinance our debt in the future.Certain of our outstanding notes contain covenants that restrict our operations and may inhibit our ability to grow our business and increase revenues.SFC’s indenture and certain of SFC’s notes contain a covenant that limits SFC’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to create or incur liens. These restrictions do not apply to OMFH and its other subsidiaries, although OMFH and its other subsidiaries are subject to similar restrictions under their debt covenants as described below. The restrictions may interfere with our ability to obtain new or additional financing or may affect the manner in which we structure such new or additional financing or engage in other business activities, which may significantly limit or harm our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. A default and resulting acceleration of obligations could also result in an event of default and declaration of acceleration under certain of our other existing debt agreements. Such an acceleration of our debt would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to continue as a going concern. A default could also significantly limit our alternatives to refinance both the debt under which the default occurred and other indebtedness. This limitation may significantly restrict our financing options during times of either market distress or our financial distress, which are precisely the times when having financing options is most important.The indenture governing OneMain’s unsecured debt (the “OMFH Indenture”) contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on OneMain and may limit our ability to integrate OneMain’s operations, including, but not limited to, restrictions on OMFH’s and its restricted subsidiaries’ ability to:•incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock;•make dividend payments or distributions on or purchases of OMFH’s equity interests;•make other restricted payments or investments;•create or permit to exist certain liens;•make certain dispositions of assets;•engage in certain transactions with affiliates;•sell certain securities of our subsidiaries;28Table of Contents•in the case of such restricted subsidiaries, incur limitations on the ability to pay dividends or make other payments; and•merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of OneMain’s properties and assets.In addition, the OMFH Indenture includes a change of control repurchase provision which could require us to offer to repurchase all of the outstanding existing notes of OMFH issued thereunder if a change of control occurs and a corporate rating of OMFH is downgraded by both Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) as a result of such change of control. Although we believe that a repurchase event is unlikely to occur, there can be no assurance that a repurchase event will not occur as a result of the SoftBank-Fortress transaction.The assessment of our liquidity is based upon significant judgments and estimates that could prove to be materially incorrect.In assessing our current financial position and developing operating plans for the future, management has made significant judgments and estimates with respect to our liquidity, including but not limited to:•our ability to generate sufficient cash to service all of our outstanding debt;•our continued ability to access debt and securitization markets and other sources of funding on favorable terms;•our ability to complete on favorable terms, as needed, additional borrowings, securitizations, finance receivable portfolio sales, or other transactions to support liquidity, and the costs associated with these funding sources, including sales at less than carrying value and limits on the types of assets that can be securitized or sold, which would affect profitability;•the potential for downgrade of our debt by rating agencies, which would have a negative impact on our cost of, and access to, capital;•our ability to comply with our debt covenants;•the amount of cash expected to be received from our finance receivable portfolio through collections (including prepayments) and receipt of finance charges, which could be materially different than our estimates;•the potential for declining financial flexibility and reduced income should we use more of our assets for securitizations and finance receivable portfolio sales; and•the potential for reduced income due to the possible deterioration of the credit quality of our finance receivable portfolios.Additionally, there are numerous risks to our financial results, liquidity, and capital raising and debt refinancing plans that are not quantified in our current liquidity forecasts. These risks include, but are not limited, to the following:•our inability to grow our personal loan portfolio with adequate profitability to fund operations, loan losses, and other expenses;•our inability to monetize assets including, but not limited to, our access to debt and securitization markets;•our inability to obtain the additional necessary funding to finance our operations;•the effect of federal, state and local laws, regulations, or regulatory policies and practices, including the Dodd-Frank Act (which, among other things, established the CFPB with broad authority to regulate and examine financial institutions), on our ability to conduct business or the manner in which we conduct business, such as licensing requirements, pricing limitations or restrictions on the method of offering products, as well as changes that may result from increased regulatory scrutiny of the sub-prime lending industry;•potential liability relating to real estate and personal loans which we have sold or may sell in the future, or relating to securitized loans, if it is determined that there was a non-curable breach of a warranty made in connection with the transaction;29Table of Contents•the potential for increasing costs and difficulty in servicing our loan portfolio as a result of heightened nationwide regulatory scrutiny of loan servicing and foreclosure practices in the industry generally, and related costs that could be passed on to us in connection with the subservicing of our real estate loans that were originated or acquired centrally;•reduced cash receipts as a result of the liquidation of our real estate loan portfolio;•the potential for additional unforeseen cash demands or accelerations of obligations;•reduced income due to loan modifications where the borrower’s interest rate is reduced, principal payments are deferred, or other concessions are made;•the potential for declines or volatility in bond and equity markets; and•the potential effect on us if the capital levels of our regulated and unregulated subsidiaries prove inadequate to support current business plans.We intend to repay indebtedness with one or more of the following activities, among others: finance receivable collections, cash on hand, additional debt financings (particularly new securitizations and possible new issuances and/or debt refinancing transactions), finance receivable portfolio sales, or a combination of the foregoing. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in undertaking any of these activities to support our operations and repay our obligations.However, the actual outcome of one or more of our plans could be materially different than expected or one or more of our significant judgments or estimates about the potential effects of these risks and uncertainties could prove to be materially incorrect. In the event of such an occurrence, if third-party financing is not available, our liquidity could be substantially and materially affected, and as a result, substantial doubt could exist about our ability to continue as a going concern.Current ratings could adversely affect our ability to raise capital in the debt markets at attractive rates, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Each of S&P, Moody’s, and Fitch, Inc. (“Fitch”) rates SFC’s and OMFH’s debt. As of December 31, 2016, SFC’s long term corporate debt rating was rated B with a stable outlook by S&P, B- with a positive outlook by Fitch and B3 with a positive outlook by Moody’s. As of December 31, 2016, OMFH’s long term corporate debt rating was rated B with a stable outlook by S&P, B with a positive outlook by Fitch and B2 with a positive outlook by Moody’s. Currently, no other OneMain or Springleaf entity has a corporate debt rating, though they may be rated in the future. Ratings reflect the rating agencies’ opinions of a company’s financial strength, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet our obligations. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating.If SFC’s or OMFH’s current ratings continue in effect or our ratings are downgraded, it will likely increase the interest rate that we would have to pay to raise money in the capital markets, making it more expensive for us to borrow money and adversely impacting our access to capital. As a result, our ratings could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our securitizations may expose us to financing and other risks, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to access the securitization market in the future, which may require us to seek more costly financing.We have securitized, and may in the future securitize, certain of our finance receivables to generate cash to originate or purchase new finance receivables or pay our outstanding indebtedness. In such transactions, we typically convey a pool of finance receivables to a special purpose entity (“SPE”), which, in turn, conveys the finance receivables to a trust (the issuing entity). Concurrently, the trust typically issues non-recourse notes or certificates pursuant to the terms of an indenture or pooling and servicing agreement, which then are transferred to the SPE in exchange for the finance receivables. The securities issued by the trust are secured by the pool of finance receivables. In exchange for the transfer of finance receivables to the issuing entity, we typically receive the cash proceeds from the sale of the trust securities, all residual interests, if any, in the cash flows from the finance receivables after payment of the trust securities, and a 100% beneficial interest in the issuing entity.Although we have successfully completed a number of securitizations since 2012, we can give no assurances that we will be able to complete additional securitizations if the securitization markets become constrained. In addition, the value of any 30Table of Contentssubordinated securities that we may retain in our securitizations might be reduced or, in some cases, eliminated as a result of an adverse change in economic conditions.SFC and OneMain Financial Group, LLC (“OMFG”) currently act as the servicers with respect to the consumer loan securitization trusts and related series of asset-backed securities. If SFC or OMFG defaults in its servicing obligations, an early amortization event could occur with respect to the relevant asset-backed securities and SFC or OMFG could be replaced as servicer. Servicer defaults include, for example, the failure of the servicer to make any payment, transfer or deposit in accordance with the securitization documents, a breach of representations, warranties or agreements made by the servicer under the securitization documents and the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the servicer. Such an early amortization event could have materially adverse consequences on our liquidity and cost of funds.Rating agencies may also affect our ability to execute a securitization transaction, or increase the costs we expect to incur from executing securitization transactions, not only by deciding not to issue ratings for our securitization transactions, but also by altering the criteria and process they follow in issuing ratings. Rating agencies could alter their ratings processes or criteria after we have accumulated finance receivables for securitization in a manner that effectively reduces the value of those finance receivables by increasing our financing costs or otherwise requiring that we incur additional costs to comply with those processes and criteria. We have no ability to control or predict what actions the rating agencies may take.Further, other matters, such as (i) accounting standards applicable to securitization transactions and (ii) capital and leverage requirements applicable to banks and other regulated financial institutions holding residential mortgage-backed securities or other asset-backed securities, could result in decreased investor demand for securities issued through our securitization transactions, or increased competition from other institutions that undertake securitization transactions. In addition, compliance with certain regulatory requirements, including the Dodd-Frank Act and the Investment Company Act, may affect the type of securitizations that we are able to complete.If it is not possible or economical for us to securitize our finance receivables in the future, we would need to seek alternative financing to support our operations and to meet our existing debt obligations, which may be less efficient and more expensive than raising capital via securitizations and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.RISKS RELATED TO OUR ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTUREIf the ownership of our common stock continues to be highly concentrated, it may prevent minority stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and may result in conflicts of interest.The Initial Stockholder, which is primarily owned by a private equity fund managed by an affiliate of Fortress, owned approximately 58% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2016. As a result, the Initial Stockholder owns shares sufficient for the majority vote over all matters requiring a stockholder vote, including: the election of directors; mergers, consolidations and acquisitions; the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other decisions affecting our capital structure; the amendment of our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws; and our winding up and dissolution. This concentration of ownership may delay, deter or prevent acts that would be favored by our other stockholders. The interests of the Initial Stockholder may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of our other stockholders. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of us. Also, the Initial Stockholder may seek to cause us to take courses of action that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment in us, but which might involve risks to our other stockholders or adversely affect us or our other stockholders. As a result, the market price of our common stock could decline or stockholders might not receive a premium over the then-current market price of our common stock upon a change in control. In addition, this concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in a company with significant stockholders. On February 14, 2017, SoftBank and Fortress announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement under which SoftBank intends to acquire Fortress. There are no assurances that the acquisition of Fortress by SoftBank will not have an impact on us.We are a holding company with no operations and rely on our operating subsidiaries to provide us with funds necessary to meet our financial obligations and to pay dividends.We are a holding company with no material direct operations. Our principal assets are the equity interests we directly or indirectly hold in our operating subsidiaries, which own our operating assets. As a result, we are dependent on loans, dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock. Our subsidiaries are legally distinct from us and certain of our subsidiaries are prohibited or restricted 31Table of Contentsfrom paying dividends or otherwise making funds available to us under certain conditions. For example, our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit their ability to pay dividends or make loans or advances to us, principally to protect policyholders, and certain of our debt agreements limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. In addition, OMFH’s debt covenants restrict its ability to pay dividends. If we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to, or our board may exercise its discretion not to, pay dividends.We do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.We have no plans to pay regular dividends on our common stock, and we anticipate that a significant amount of any free cash flow generated from our operations will be utilized to redeem or prepay outstanding indebtedness, and accordingly would not be available for dividends. Any declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant. Until such time that we pay a dividend, our investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. In addition, the OMFH Indenture contains certain restrictions on OMFH’s and its restricted subsidiaries’ ability to make dividend payments.Certain provisions of a stockholders agreement with our Initial Stockholder (the “Stockholders Agreement”), our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws could hinder, delay or prevent a change in control of us, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.Certain provisions of the Stockholders Agreement, our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors or Fortress. These provisions provide for:•a classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms;•removal of directors only for cause and only with the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the voting interest of stockholders entitled to vote (provided, however, that for so long as Fortress and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least 30% of our issued and outstanding common stock (including Fortress’ proportionate interest in shares of our common stock held by the Initial Stockholder), directors may be removed with or without cause with the affirmative vote of a majority of the then issued and outstanding voting interest of stockholders entitled to vote);•provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws prevent stockholders from calling special meetings of our stockholders (provided, however, that for so long as Fortress and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least 20% of our issued and outstanding common stock (including Fortress’s proportionate interest in shares of our common stock held by the Initial Stockholder), any stockholders that collectively beneficially own at least 20% of our issued and outstanding common stock may call special meetings of our stockholders);•advance notice requirements by stockholders with respect to director nominations and actions to be taken at annual meetings;•certain rights to Fortress and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees with respect to the designation of directors for nomination and election to our board of directors, including the ability to appoint a majority of the members of our board of directors, plus one director, for so long as Fortress and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees continue to beneficially own, directly or indirectly at least 30% of our issued and outstanding common stock (including Fortress’s proportionate interest in shares of our common stock held by the Initial Stockholder);•no provision in our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws permits cumulative voting in the election of directors, which means that the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock can elect all the directors standing for election;•our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws only permit action by our stockholders outside a meeting by unanimous written consent, provided, however, that for so long as Fortress and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least 20% of our issued and 32Table of Contentsoutstanding common stock (including Fortress’s proportionate interest in shares of our common stock held by the Initial Stockholder), our stockholders may act without a meeting by written consent of a majority of our stockholders; and•under our restated certificate of incorporation, our board of directors has authority to cause the issuance of preferred stock from time to time in one or more series and to establish the terms, preferences and rights of any such series of preferred stock, all without approval of our stockholders. Nothing in our restated certificate of incorporation precludes future issuances without stockholder approval of the authorized but unissued shares of our common stock.In addition, these provisions may make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a tender offer, change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by Fortress, our management or our board of directors. Public stockholders who might desire to participate in these types of transactions may not have an opportunity to do so, even if the transaction is favorable to stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to benefit from a change in control or change our management and board of directors and, as a result, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the ability of public stockholders to realize any potential change of control premium.Certain of our stockholders have the right to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses as us.Fortress and its affiliates, including the Initial Stockholder, engage in other investments and business activities in addition to their ownership of us. Under our restated certificate of incorporation, Fortress and its affiliates, including the Initial Stockholder, have the right, and have no duty to abstain from exercising such right, to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses as us, do business with any of our clients, customers or vendors or employ or otherwise engage any of our officers, directors or employees. If Fortress and its affiliates, including the Initial Stockholder, or any of their officers, directors or employees acquire knowledge of a potential transaction that could be a corporate opportunity, they have no duty, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to offer such corporate opportunity to us, our stockholders or our affiliates.In the event that any of our directors and officers who is also a director, officer or employee of any of Fortress or its affiliates, including the Initial Stockholder, acquires knowledge of a corporate opportunity or is offered a corporate opportunity, provided that this knowledge was not acquired solely in such person’s capacity as our director or officer and such person acts in good faith, then even if Fortress or its affiliates, including the Initial Stockholder, pursues or acquires the corporate opportunity or if Fortress or its affiliates, including the Initial Stockholder, do not present the corporate opportunity to us such person is deemed to have fully satisfied such person’s fiduciary duties owed to us and is not liable to us.Licensing and insurance laws and regulations may delay or impede purchases of our common stock.Certain of the states in which we are licensed to originate loans and the states in which Springleaf and OneMain insurance subsidiaries are domiciled (Indiana and Texas) have laws or regulations which require regulatory approval for the acquisition of “control” of regulated entities. In addition, these Indiana and Texas insurance laws and regulations generally provide that no person may acquire control, directly or indirectly, of a domiciled insurer, unless the person has provided the required information to, and the acquisition is subsequently approved or not disapproved by, the Indiana Department of Insurance and also by the Texas Department of Insurance. Under state insurance laws or regulations, there exists a presumption of “control” when an acquiring party acquires as little as 10% of the voting securities of a regulated entity or of a company which itself controls (directly or indirectly) a regulated entity (the threshold is 10% under the insurance statutes of Indiana and Texas). Therefore, any person acquiring 10% or more of our common stock may need the prior approval of these two state insurance and/or licensing regulators, or a determination from such regulators that “control” has not been acquired, which could significantly delay or otherwise impede their ability to complete such purchase. The acquisition of Fortress by SoftBank may be deemed a change of control for purposes of certain of our state lending and insurance licenses pursuant to which we operate our lending and insurance businesses. Accordingly, we may be required to obtain approvals for the change of control from some state lending or insurance regulators.33Table of ContentsRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCKThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our stockholders.The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. If the market price of our common stock declines significantly, public stockholders may be unable to resell their shares at or above their purchase price, if at all. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include:•variations in our quarterly or annual operating results;•changes in our earnings estimates (if provided) or differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts;•the contents of published research reports about us or our industry or the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock in the future;•additions to, or departures of, key management personnel;•any increased indebtedness we may incur in the future;•announcements by us or others and developments affecting us;•actions by institutional stockholders or our Initial Stockholder or Fortress;•litigation and governmental investigations;•changes in market valuations of similar companies;•speculation or reports by the press or investment community with respect to us or our industry in general;•increases in market interest rates that may lead purchasers of our shares to demand a higher yield;•announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments; and•general market, political and economic conditions, including any such conditions and local conditions in the markets in which our borrowers are located.These broad company, market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The stock market in general has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, including in recent months. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.Future offerings of debt or equity securities by us may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.In the future, we may attempt to obtain financing or to further increase our capital resources by issuing additional shares of our common stock or offering debt or other equity securities, including commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior or subordinated notes, debt securities convertible into equity or shares of preferred stock. In particular, we intend to continue to seek opportunities to acquire consumer finance portfolios and/or businesses that engage in consumer finance loan servicing and/or consumer finance loan originations. Future acquisitions could require substantial additional capital in excess of cash from operations. We would expect to finance the capital required for acquisitions through a combination of additional issuances of equity, corporate indebtedness, asset-backed acquisition financing and/or cash from operations.34Table of ContentsIssuing additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities or securities convertible into equity may dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders at the time of such issuance or reduce the market price of our common stock or both. Upon liquidation, holders of debt securities and preferred shares, if issued, and lenders with respect to other borrowings would receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. Debt securities convertible into equity could be subject to adjustments in the conversion ratio pursuant to which certain events may increase the number of equity securities issuable upon conversion. Preferred shares, if issued, could have a preference with respect to liquidating distributions or a preference with respect to dividend payments that could limit our ability to pay dividends to the holders of our common stock. Our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our common stock bear the risk that our future offerings may reduce the market price of our common stock and dilute their stockholdings in us.The market price of our common stock could be negatively affected by sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets.As of December 31, 2016, approximately 58% of our outstanding common stock is held by the Initial Stockholder and can be resold into the public markets in the future in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). A decline in the price of our common stock might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional common stock or other equity securities.The future issuance of additional common stock in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions or otherwise will dilute all other stockholdings.We have an aggregate of 1,864,775,073 shares of common stock authorized but unissued as of February 14, 2017. We may issue all of these shares of common stock without any action or approval by our stockholders, subject to certain exceptions. We also intend to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and may issue common stock in connection with these acquisitions. Any common stock issued in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions, the exercise of outstanding stock options or otherwise would dilute the percentage ownership held by our existing shareholders.Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable reports and prevent fraud.We believe that a control system, no matter how well designed and managed, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. We may not be able to identify all significant deficiencies and/or material weaknesses in our internal control in the future, and our failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects"
2,OMF,ONEMAIN HOLDINGS INC,2016-02-29,"Risk Factors
.    We face a variety of risks that are inherent in our business. Accordingly, you should carefully consider the following discussion of risks in addition to the other information regarding our business provided in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC. These risks are subject to contingencies which may or may not occur, and we are not able to express a view on the likelihood of any such contingency occurring. New risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our business or financial performance.13Table of ContentsRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSOur consolidated results of operations and financial condition and our borrowers’ ability to make payments on their loans have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by economic conditions and other factors that we cannot control.Uncertainty and negative trends in general economic conditions in the United States and abroad, including significant tightening of credit markets and a general decline in the value of real property, historically have created a difficult operating environment for our businesses and other companies in our industries. Many factors, including factors that are beyond our control, may impact our consolidated results of operations or financial condition and/or affect our borrowers’ willingness or capacity to make payments on their loans. These factors include: unemployment levels, housing markets, energy costs and interest rates; events such as natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, catastrophes, major medical expenses, divorce or death that affect our borrowers; and the quality of the collateral underlying our receivables. If we experience an economic downturn or if the U.S. economy is unable to continue or sustain its recovery from the most recent economic downturn, or if we become affected by other events beyond our control, we may experience a significant reduction in revenues, earnings and cash flows, difficulties accessing capital and a deterioration in the value of our investments. We may also become exposed to increased credit risk from our customers and third parties who have obligations to us.Moreover, our customers are primarily non-prime borrowers. Accordingly, such borrowers have historically been, and may in the future become, more likely to be affected, or more severely affected, by adverse macroeconomic conditions. If our borrowers default under a finance receivable held directly by us, we will bear a risk of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral, if any, and the outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest of the finance receivable, which could adversely affect our cash flow from operations. In addition, foreclosure of a real estate loan (part of our legacy real estate portfolio) is an expensive and lengthy process that can negatively affect our anticipated return on the foreclosed loan. The cost to service our loans may also increase without a corresponding increase in our finance charge income.Also, certain geographic concentrations of our loan portfolio may occur or increase as we adjust our risk and loss tolerance and strategy to achieve our profitability goals. Any geographic concentration may expose us to an increased risk of loss if that geographic region experiences higher unemployment rates than average, natural disasters, weak economic conditions, or other adverse economic factors that disproportionately affect that region. See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for quantification of our largest concentrations of net finance receivables.If aspects of our business, including the quality of our finance receivables portfolio or our borrowers, are significantly affected by economic changes or any other conditions in the future, we cannot be certain that our policies and procedures for underwriting, processing and servicing loans will adequately adapt to such changes. If we fail to adapt to changing economic conditions or other factors, or if such changes affect our borrowers’ willingness or capacity to repay their loans, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity would be materially adversely affected.There are risks associated with the acquisition of large loan portfolios, including the possibility of increased delinquencies and losses, difficulties with integrating the loans into our servicing platform and disruption to our ongoing business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We may acquire large portfolios of finance receivables in the future either through the direct purchase of such assets or the purchase of the equity of a company with such a portfolio. Since we will not have originated or serviced the loans we acquire, we may not be aware of legal or other deficiencies related to origination or servicing, and our review of the portfolio prior to purchase may not uncover those deficiencies. Further, we may have limited recourse against the seller of the portfolio.The ability to integrate and successfully service newly acquired loan portfolios will depend in large part on the success of our development and integration of expanded servicing capabilities, including additional personnel. We may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction if the integration process takes longer, or is more costly, than expected. Our failure to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating the acquired portfolios with our current business or otherwise to realize any of the anticipated benefits of the transaction, could impair our operations. In addition, the integration of future large portfolio acquisitions are complex, time-consuming and expensive processes that, without proper planning and effective and timely implementation, could significantly disrupt our business.14Table of ContentsPotential difficulties we may encounter during the integration process with future acquisitions include, but are not limited to, the following:•the integration of the portfolio into our information technology platforms and servicing systems;•the quality of servicing during any interim servicing period after we purchase a portfolio but before we assume servicing obligations from the seller or its agents;•the disruption to our ongoing businesses and distraction of our management teams from ongoing business concerns;•incomplete or inaccurate files and records;•the retention of existing customers;•the creation of uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems;•the occurrence of unanticipated expenses; and•potential unknown liabilities associated with the transactions, including legal liability related to origination and servicing prior to the acquisition.For example, in some cases loan files and other information (including servicing records) may be incomplete or inaccurate. If our employees are unable to access customer information easily, or if we are unable to produce originals or copies of documents or accurate information about the loans, collections could be affected significantly, and we may not be able to enforce our right to collect in some cases. Similarly, collections could be affected by any changes to our collection practices, the restructuring of any key servicing functions, transfer of files and other changes that would result from our assumption of the servicing of the acquired portfolios.The anticipated benefits and synergies of our future acquisitions will assume a successful integration, and will be based on projections, which are inherently uncertain, as well as other assumptions. Even if integration is successful, anticipated benefits and synergies may not be achieved.There are risks associated with our ability to expand our centralized loan servicing capabilities through integration of the Springleaf and OneMain servicing facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.A key part of our efforts to expand our centralized loan servicing capacity will depend in large part on the success of management’s efforts to integrate the Springleaf and OneMain servicing facilities. We may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of these facilities if the integration process takes longer, or is more costly, than expected. Our failure to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating these facilities with our current business or otherwise to realize any of the anticipated benefits could impair our operations. In addition, the integration is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process that, without proper planning and effective and timely implementation, could significantly disrupt our business. Potential difficulties we may encounter during the integration process may include, but are not limited to, the following:•the integration of the personnel with certain of our management teams, strategies, operations, products and services;•the integration of the physical facilities with our information technology platforms and servicing systems; and•the disruption to our ongoing businesses and distraction of our management teams from ongoing business concerns.If our estimates of finance receivable losses are not adequate to absorb actual losses, our provision for finance receivable losses would increase, which would adversely affect our results of operations.We maintain an allowance for finance receivable losses. To estimate the appropriate level of allowance for finance receivable losses, we consider known and relevant internal and external factors that affect finance receivable collectability, including the total amount of finance receivables outstanding, historical finance receivable charge-offs, our current collection patterns, and economic trends. Our methodology for establishing our allowance for finance receivable losses is based on the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 450 and, in part, on our historic loss experience. If customer behavior changes as a result of economic conditions and if we are unable to predict how the unemployment rate, housing foreclosures, and general 15Table of Contentseconomic uncertainty may affect our allowance for finance receivable losses, our provision may be inadequate. Our allowance for finance receivable losses is an estimate, and if actual finance receivable losses are materially greater than our allowance for finance receivable losses, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Neither state regulators nor federal regulators regulate our allowance for finance receivable losses. Additional information regarding our allowance for finance receivable losses is included in the section captioned “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Allowance for Finance Receivable Losses.”Our risk management efforts may not be effective.We could incur substantial losses and our business operations could be disrupted if we are unable to effectively identify, manage, monitor, and mitigate financial risks, such as credit risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk, liquidity risk, and other market-related risks, as well as operational risks related to our business, assets and liabilities. To the extent our models used to assess the creditworthiness of potential borrowers do not adequately identify potential risks, the valuations produced would not adequately represent the risk profile of the borrower and could result in a riskier finance receivable profile than originally identified. Our risk management policies, procedures, and techniques, including our scoring technology, may not be sufficient to identify all of the risks we are exposed to, mitigate the risks we have identified or identify concentrations of risk or additional risks to which we may become subject in the future.Our branch loan approval process is decentralized, which may result in variability of loan structures, and could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our branch finance receivable origination process is decentralized. We train our employees individually on-site in the branch to make loans that conform to our underwriting standards. Such training includes critical aspects of state and federal regulatory compliance, cash handling, account management and customer relations. In certain circumstances, subject to approval by district managers and/or directors of operations in certain cases, our branch officers have the authority to approve and structure loans within broadly written underwriting guidelines rather than having all loan terms approved centrally. As a result, there may be variability in finance receivable structure (e.g., whether or not collateral is taken for the loan) and loan portfolios among branch offices or regions, even when underwriting policies are followed. Moreover, we cannot be certain that every loan is made in accordance with our underwriting standards and rules and we have in the past experienced some instances of loans extended that varied from our underwriting standards. The nature of our approval process could adversely affect our operating results and variances in underwriting standards and lack of supervision could expose us to greater delinquencies and charge-offs than we have historically experienced, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Changes in market conditions, including rising interest rates, could adversely affect the rate at which our borrowers prepay their loans and the value of our finance receivables portfolio, as well as increase our financing cost, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Changing market conditions, including but not limited to, changes in interest rates, the availability of credit, the relative economic vitality of the area in which our borrowers and their assets are located, changes in tax laws, other opportunities for investment available to our customers, homeowner mobility, and other economic, social, geographic, demographic, and legal factors beyond our control, may affect the rates at which our borrowers prepay their loans. Generally, in situations where prepayment rates have slowed, the weighted-average life of our finance receivables has increased. Any increase in interest rates may further slow the rate of prepayment for our finance receivables, which could adversely affect our liquidity by reducing the cash flows from, and the value of, the finance receivables we hold for sale or utilize as collateral in our secured funding transactions.Moreover, the vast majority of our finance receivables are fixed-rate finance receivables, which generally decline in value if interest rates increase. As such, if changing market conditions cause interest rates to increase substantially, the value of our fixed-rate finance receivables could decline. In addition, rising interests rates will increase our cost of capital. Accordingly, any increase in interest rates could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We may be required to indemnify, or repurchase finance receivables from, purchasers of finance receivables that we have sold or securitized, or which we will sell or securitize in the future, if our finance receivables fail to meet certain criteria or characteristics or under other circumstances, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We have sold $6.4 billion of our legacy real estate portfolio in 2014 and have securitized $11.4 billion of our consumer loan portfolio and all of the SpringCastle Portfolio at December 31, 2015. The documents governing our finance receivable sales 16Table of Contentsand securitizations contain provisions that require us to indemnify the purchasers of securitized finance receivables, or to repurchase the affected finance receivables, under certain circumstances. While our sale and securitization documents vary, they generally contain customary provisions that may require us to repurchase finance receivables if:•our representations and warranties concerning the quality and characteristics of the finance receivable are inaccurate;•there is borrower fraud; and•we fail to comply, at the individual finance receivable level or otherwise, with regulatory requirements in connection with the origination and servicing of the finance receivables.As a result of the current market environment, we believe that many purchasers of real estate loans (including through securitizations) are particularly aware of the conditions under which originators must indemnify purchasers or repurchase finance receivables, and would benefit from enforcing any repurchase remedies that they may have. At its extreme, our exposure to repurchases or our indemnification obligations under our representations and warranties could include the current unpaid balance of all finance receivables that we have sold or securitized and which are not subject to settlement agreements with purchasers.The risk of loss on the finance receivables that we have securitized is recognized in our allowance for finance receivable losses since all of our consumer loan securitizations are recorded on-balance sheet. If we are required to indemnify purchasers or repurchase finance receivables that we sell that result in losses that exceed our reserve for sales recourse, or recognize losses on securitized finance receivables that exceed our recorded allowance for finance receivable losses associated with our securitizations, this could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our insurance operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including claims, catastrophic events, underwriting risks and dependence on a primary distribution channel.Insurance claims and policyholder liabilities are difficult to predict and may exceed the related reserves set aside for claims (losses) and associated expenses for claims adjudication (loss adjustment expenses). Additionally, events such as hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes, pandemic disease, cyber security breaches and other types of catastrophes, and prolonged economic downturns, could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Other risks relating to our insurance operations include changes to laws and regulations applicable to us, as well as changes to the regulatory environment. Examples include changes to laws or regulations affecting capital and reserve requirements; frequency and type of regulatory monitoring and reporting; consumer privacy, use of customer data and data security; benefits or loss ratio requirements; insurance producer licensing or appointment requirements; required disclosures to consumers; and collateral protection insurance (i.e., insurance some of our lender companies purchase, at the customer’s expense, on that customer’s loan collateral for the periods of time the customer fails to adequately, as required by his loan, insure his collateral). Because our customers do not affirmatively consent to collateral protection insurance at the time it is purchased and hence, do not directly agree to the amount charged for it, regulators may in the future prohibit our insurance companies from providing this insurance to our lending operations. Moreover, our insurance companies are predominately dependent on our lending operations as the primary source of business and product distribution. If our lending operations discontinue offering insurance products, including as a result of regulatory requirements, our insurance operations would basically have no method of distribution for their products.We are a party to various lawsuits and proceedings which, if resolved in a manner adverse to us, could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.In the normal course of business, from time to time, we have been named as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with our business activities. Certain of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages, or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. Some of these proceedings are pending in jurisdictions that permit damage awards disproportionate to the actual economic damages alleged to have been incurred. The continued occurrences of large damage awards in general in the United States, including large punitive damage awards in certain jurisdictions that bear little or no relation to actual economic damages incurred by plaintiffs, create the potential for an unpredictable result in any given proceeding. A large judgment that is adverse to us could cause our reputation to suffer, encourage additional lawsuits against us and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.17Table of ContentsIf we lose the services of any of our key management personnel, our business could suffer.Our future success significantly depends on the continued service and performance of our key management personnel. Competition for these employees is intense and we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel. We do not maintain any “key man” or other related insurance. The loss of the service of members of our senior management or key team members, or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed, could materially harm our business.Employee misconduct could harm us by subjecting us to monetary loss, significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm.Our reputation is critical to maintaining and developing relationships with our existing and potential customers and third parties with whom we do business. There is a risk that our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. For example, if an employee were to engage—or be accused of engaging—in illegal or suspicious activities including fraud or theft, we could suffer direct losses from the activity, and in addition we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial condition, customer relationships, and ability to attract future customers. Employee misconduct could prompt regulators to allege or to determine based upon such misconduct that we have not established adequate supervisory systems and procedures to inform employees of applicable rules or to detect and deter violations of such rules. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent misconduct may not be effective in all cases. Misconduct by our employees, or even unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct, could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business.Current and proposed regulations relating to consumer privacy, data protection and information security could increase our costs.We are subject to a number of federal and state consumer privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations. For example, we are subject to the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which governs the use of personal financial information by financial institutions. Moreover, various federal and state regulatory agencies require us to notify customers in the event of a security breach. Federal and state legislators and regulators are increasingly pursuing new guidance, laws, and regulation. Compliance with current or future customer privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations could result in higher compliance, technology or other operating costs. Any violations of these laws and regulations may require us to change our business practices or operational structure, and could subject us to legal claims, monetary penalties, sanctions, and the obligation to indemnify and/or notify customers or take other remedial actions.Significant disruptions in the operation of our information systems could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our business relies heavily on information systems to deliver products and services to our customers, and to manage our ongoing operations. These systems may encounter service disruptions due to system, network or software failure, security breaches, computer viruses, natural disasters or other reasons. There can be no assurance that our policies and procedures addressing these issues will adequately address the disruption. A disruption could impair our ability to offer and process consumer loans, provide customer service, perform collections activities or perform other necessary business activities, which could result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability.Security breaches in our information systems, in the information systems of third parties or in our branches, central servicing facilities, or our internet lending platform could adversely affect our reputation and could subject us to significant costs and regulatory penalties.Our operations rely heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential customer and other information in our computer systems and networks. Our branch offices and centralized servicing centers, as well as our administrative and executive offices, are part of an electronic information network that is designed to permit us to originate and track finance receivables and collections, and perform several other tasks that are part of our everyday operations. Our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious code that could result in disruption to our business, or the loss or theft of confidential information, including customer information. Any failure, interruption, or breach in our cyber security, including any failure of our back-up systems or failure to maintain adequate security surrounding customer information, could result in reputational harm, disruption in the management of our customer relationships, or the inability to originate, process and service our finance receivable products. Further, any of these cyber security and operational risks could result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to lawsuits by customers for identity theft or other damages resulting from the misuse of their personal information and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial 18Table of Contentscondition and liquidity. In addition, regulators may impose penalties or require remedial action if they identify weaknesses in our security systems, and we may be required to incur significant costs to increase our cyber security to address any vulnerabilities that may be discovered or to remediate the harm caused by any security breaches. As part of our business, we may share confidential customer information and proprietary information with clients, vendors, service providers, and business partners. The information systems of these third parties may be vulnerable to security breaches and we may not be able to ensure that these third parties have appropriate security controls in place to protect the information we share with them. If our confidential information is intercepted, stolen, misused, or mishandled while in possession of a third party, it could result in reputational harm to us, loss of customer business, and additional regulatory scrutiny, and it could expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Although we have insurance that is intended to cover certain losses from such events, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate or available.Our branch offices and centralized servicing centers have physical customer records necessary for day-to-day operations that contain extensive confidential information about our customers, including financial and personally identifiable information. We also retain physical records in various storage locations outside of these locations. The loss or theft of customer information and data from our branch offices, central servicing facilities, or other storage locations could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and penalties, and could expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, if we cannot locate original documents (or copies, in some cases), we may not be able to collect on the finance receivables for which we do not have documents.We may not be able to make technological improvements as quickly as some of our competitors, which could harm our ability to compete with our competitors and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial and lending institutions to better serve customers and reduce costs. Our future success and, in particular, the success of our centralized operations, will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services as quickly as some of our competitors or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could harm our ability to compete with our competitors and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We could face environmental liability and costs for damage caused by hazardous waste (including the cost of cleaning up contaminated property) if we foreclose upon or otherwise take title to real estate pledged as collateral.If a real estate loan goes into default, we start foreclosure proceedings in appropriate circumstances, which could result in our taking title to the mortgaged real estate. We also consider alternatives to foreclosure, such as “short sales,” where we do not take title to mortgaged real estate. There is a risk that toxic or hazardous substances could be found on property after we take title. In addition, we own certain properties through which we operate our business, such as the buildings at our headquarters, and the servicing facilities in London, Kentucky, Fort Mill, South Carolina, Fort Worth, Texas, and Irving, Texas. As the owner of any property where hazardous waste is present, we could be held liable for clean-up and remediation costs, as well as damages for any personal injuries or property damage caused by the condition of the property. We may also be responsible for these costs if we are in the chain of title for the property, even if we were not responsible for the contamination and even if the contamination is not discovered until after we have sold the property. Costs related to these activities and damages could be substantial. Although we have policies and procedures in place to investigate properties for potential hazardous substances before taking title to properties, these reviews may not always uncover potential environmental hazards.We ceased real estate lending and the purchase of retail finance contracts and are in the process of liquidating these portfolios, which subjects us to certain risks which if we do not effectively manage could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.In connection with our plan for strategic growth and new focus on consumer lending, we engaged in a number of restructuring initiatives, including but not limited to, ceasing real estate lending, ceasing purchasing retail sales contracts and revolving retail accounts from the sale of consumer goods and services by retail merchants, closing certain of our branches and reducing our workforce.Since terminating our real estate lending business at the beginning of 2012, which historically accounted for in excess of 50% of the interest income of our business, and ceasing retail sales purchases, we have been liquidating these legacy portfolios. In 19Table of Contents2014, we entered into a series of transactions relating to the sales of our beneficial interests in our non-core real estate loans, the related servicing of these loans, and the sales of certain performing and non-performing real estate loans, which substantially completed our plan to liquidate our non-core real estate loans. Consequently, as of December 31, 2015, our real estate loans held for investment and held for sale totaled $524 million and $179 million, respectively. Due to the fact that we are no longer able to offer our remaining legacy real estate lending customers the same range of loan restructuring alternatives in delinquency situations that we may historically have extended to them, such customers may be less able, and less likely, to repay their loans.Moreover, if we fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the restructuring of our business and associated liquidation of our legacy portfolios, we may experience an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We are not able to track the default status of the senior lien loans for our second mortgages if we are not the holder of the senior loan.Second mortgages constituted 61% of our real estate loans as of December 31, 2015. In instances where we hold the second mortgage, either we or another creditor holds the first mortgage on the property, and our second mortgage is subordinate in right of payment to the first mortgage holder’s right to receive payment. If we are not the holder of the related first mortgage, we are not able to track the default status of a first mortgage for our second mortgages. In such instances, the value of our second mortgage may be lower than our records indicate and the provisions we maintain for finance receivable losses associated with such second mortgages may be inadequate.As part of our growth strategy, we have committed to building our consumer lending business. If we are unable to successfully implement our growth strategy, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.We believe that our future success depends on our ability to implement our growth strategy, the key feature of which has been to shift our primary focus to originating consumer loans as well as acquiring portfolios of consumer loans, pursuing acquisitions of companies, and/or establishing joint ventures. We have also recently expanded into internet lending through our centralized operations.We may not be able to implement our new strategy successfully, and our success depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:•address the risks associated with our new focus on personal (including auto) loan receivables, including, but not limited to consumer demand for finance receivables, and changes in economic conditions and interest rates;•address the risks associated with the new centralized method of originating and servicing our internet loans through our centralized operations, which represents a departure from our traditional high-touch branch-based servicing function and includes the potential for higher default and delinquency rates;•integrate, and develop the expertise required to capitalize on, our centralized operations;•obtain regulatory approval in connection with our internet lending;•obtain regulatory approval in connection with the acquisition of consumer loan portfolios and/or companies in the business of selling consumer loans or related products;•comply with regulations in connection with doing business and offering loan products over the internet, including various state and federal e-signature rules mandating that certain disclosures be made and certain steps be followed in order to obtain and authenticate e-signatures, with which we have limited experience;•finance future growth;•successfully source, underwrite and integrate new acquisitions of loan portfolios and other businesses; and•successfully integrate the combined companies.In order for us to realize the benefits associated with our new focus on originating and servicing consumer loans and grow our business, we must implement our strategic objectives in a timely and cost-effective manner as well as anticipate and address 20Table of Contentsany risks to which we may become subject. In any event, we may not realize these benefits for many years, or our competitors may introduce more compelling products, services or enhancements. If we are not able to realize the benefits, or if we do not do so in a timely manner, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be negatively affected which would have a material adverse effect on business.RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY AND REGULATIONWe operate in a highly competitive market, and we cannot ensure that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.The consumer finance industry is highly competitive. Our profitability depends, in large part, on our ability to originate finance receivables. We compete with other consumer finance companies as well as other types of financial institutions that offer similar products and services in originating finance receivables. Some of these competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we possess. Some competitors may also have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that may not be available to us. While banks and credit card companies have decreased their lending to non-prime customers in recent years, there is no assurance that such lenders will not resume those lending activities. Further, because of increased regulatory pressure on payday lenders, many of those lenders are starting to make more traditional installment consumer loans in order to reduce regulatory scrutiny of their practices, which could increase competition in markets in which we operate. In addition, in July 2013, the Dodd-Frank Act’s three-year moratorium on banks affiliated with non-financial businesses expired. When the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted in 2010, a moratorium was imposed that prohibited the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation from approving deposit insurance for certain banks controlled by non-financial commercial enterprises. The expiration of the moratorium could result in an increase of traditionally non- financial enterprises entering the banking space, which could increase the number of our competitors. There can be no assurance that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our businesses are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business.Our businesses are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, and various state authorities regulate and supervise our insurance operations. The laws under which a substantial amount of our consumer and real estate businesses are conducted generally: provide for state licensing of lenders and, in some cases, licensing of employees involved in real estate loan modifications; impose limits on the term of a finance receivable, amounts, interest rates and charges on the finance receivables; regulate whether and under what circumstances insurance and other ancillary products may be offered to consumers in connection with a lending transaction; regulate the manner in which we use personal data; and provide for other consumer protections. We are also subject to extensive servicing regulations which we must comply with when servicing our legacy real estate loans and the SpringCastle Portfolio, and which we will have to comply with if we acquire loan portfolios in the future and assume the servicing obligations for the acquired loans. The extent of state regulation of our insurance business varies by product and by jurisdiction, but relates primarily to the following: licensing; conduct of business; periodic examination of the affairs of insurers; form and content of required financial reports; standards of solvency; limitations on dividend payments and other related party transactions; types of products offered; approval of policy forms and premium rates; permissible investments; deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders; reserve requirements for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes; and claims processing.All of our operations are subject to regular examination by state and federal regulators, and as a whole, our entities are subject to several hundred regulatory examinations in a given year. These examinations may result in requirements to change our policies or practices, and in some cases, we are required to pay monetary fines or make reimbursements to customers. Many state regulators and some federal regulators have indicated an intention to pool their resources in order to conduct examinations of licensed entities, including us, at the same time (referred to as a “multi-state” examination). This could result in more in-depth examinations, which could be more costly and lead to more significant enforcement actions.The CFPB has recently outlined several proposals under consideration for the purpose of requiring lenders to take steps to ensure consumers have the financial ability to repay their loans. The proposals under consideration would require lenders to determine at the outset of each loan whether a consumer can afford to borrow from the lender and would require that lenders comply with various restrictions designed to ensure that consumers can affordably repay their debt to the lender. To date, the proposals under consideration by the CFPB have not been adopted. If adopted, the proposals outlined by the CFPB may require the Company to make significant changes to its lending practices to develop compliant procedures.We are also subject to potential enforcement, supervisions and other actions that may be brought by state attorneys general or other state enforcement authorities and other governmental agencies. Any such actions could subject us to civil money 21Table of Contentspenalties, customer remediation and increased compliance costs, as well as damage our reputation and brand and could limit or prohibit our ability to offer certain products and services or engage in certain business practices.The Department of Defense has made changes to the regulations that have been promulgated as a result of the Military Lending Act. Effective October 3, 2016, we will be subject to the limitations of the Military Lending Act, which places a 36% limitation on all fees, charges, interest rate and credit and non-credit insurance premiums for loans made to members of the military or their dependents. We will also no longer be able to make non-purchase money loans secured by motor vehicles to service members and their dependents.We are also subject to potential changes in state law, which could lower the interest-rate limit that non-depository financial institutions may charge for consumer loans or could expand the definition of interest under state law to include the cost of ancillary products, such as insurance.We believe that we maintain all material licenses and permits required for our current operations and are in substantial compliance with all applicable federal, state and local regulations, but we may not be able to maintain all requisite licenses and permits, and the failure to satisfy those and other regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, changes in laws or regulations applicable to us could subject us to additional licensing, registration and other regulatory requirements in the future or could adversely affect our ability to operate or the manner in which we conduct business.A material failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in regulatory actions, lawsuits and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.For more information with respect to the regulatory framework affecting our businesses, see “Business—Regulation” included in Item 1.The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act and the creation of the CFPB significantly increases our regulatory costs and burdens.The Dodd-Frank Act was adopted in 2010. This law and the related regulations affect our operations in terms of increased oversight of financial services products by the CFPB, and the imposition of restrictions on the allowable terms for certain consumer credit transactions. The CFPB has significant authority to implement and enforce federal consumer finance laws, including the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act and new requirements for financial services products provided for in the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the authority to identify and prohibit unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provides the CFPB with broad supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over various consumer financial products and services, including the ability to require reimbursements and other payments to customers for alleged legal violations, and to impose significant penalties, as well as injunctive relief that prohibits lenders from engaging in allegedly unlawful practices. Further, state attorneys general and state regulators are authorized to bring civil actions to enforce certain consumer protection provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act and accompanying regulations are being phased in over time, and while some regulations have been promulgated, many others have not yet been proposed or finalized. We cannot predict the terms of all of the final regulations, their intended consequences or how such regulations will affect us or our industry.The CFPB currently has supervisory authority over our real estate servicing activities, and likely will have supervisory authority over our consumer lending business. It also has the authority to bring enforcement actions for violations of laws over which it has jurisdiction regardless of whether it has supervisory authority for a given product or service. Effective in January 2014, the CFPB finalized mortgage servicing regulations, which makes it more difficult and expensive to service mortgages. The Dodd-Frank Act also gives the CFPB supervisory authority over entities that are designated as “larger participants” in certain financial services markets, including consumer installment loans and related products. The CFPB has not yet promulgated regulations that designate “larger participants” for consumer finance companies. If we are designated as a “larger participant” for this market, we also will be subject to supervision and examination by the CFPB with respect to our consumer loan business. The CFPB has published regulations for “larger participants” in the market of auto finance, and we have been designated as a larger participant in this market. The CFPB’s broad supervisory and enforcement powers could affect our business and operations significantly in terms of increased operating and regulatory compliance costs, and limits on the types of products we offer and the manner in which they are offered, among other things. See “Business—Regulation” for further information on the CFPB.The CFPB and certain state regulators have taken action against select lenders regarding the marketing of products offered by the lenders in connection with their loans. The products included debt cancellation/suspension products written by the lenders 22Table of Contentswhich forgave a borrower’s debt or monthly minimum payment upon the occurrence of certain events in the life of the borrower (e.g., death, disability, marriage, divorce, birth of a child, etc.). We sell insurance and non-insurance products in connection with our loans. Although these products are actively regulated by state insurance departments, sales of these products could be challenged in a similar manner by the CFPB or state consumer lending regulators.Our use of third-party vendors is subject to increasing regulatory attention.Recently, the CFPB and other regulators have issued regulatory guidance that has focused on the need for financial institutions to perform increased due diligence and ongoing monitoring of third-party vendor relationships, thus increasing the scope of management involvement and decreasing the benefit that we receive from using third-party vendors. Moreover, if our regulators conclude that we have not met the heightened standards for oversight of our third-party vendors, we could be subject to enforcement actions, civil monetary penalties, supervisory orders to cease and desist or other remedial actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.We purchase and sell finance receivables, including charged off receivables and receivables where the borrower is in default. This practice could subject us to heightened regulatory scrutiny, which may expose us to legal action, cause us to incur losses and/or limit or impede our collection activity.As part of our business model, we purchase and sell finance receivables. Although the borrowers for some of these finance receivables are current on their payments, other borrowers may be in default (including in bankruptcy) or the debt may have been charged off as uncollectible. The CFPB and other regulators have recently significantly increased their scrutiny of the purchase and sale of debt, and collections practices undertaken by purchasers of debt, especially delinquent and charged off debt. The CFPB has scrutinized sellers of debt for not maintaining sufficient documentation to support and verify the validity or amount of the debt. It has also scrutinized debt collectors for, among other things, their collection tactics, attempting to collect debts that no longer are valid, misrepresenting the amount of the debt and not having sufficient documentation to verify the validity or amount of the debt. Our purchases or sales of receivables could expose us to lawsuits or fines by regulators if we do not have sufficient documentation to support and verify the validity and amount of the finance receivables underlying these transactions, or if we or purchasers of our finance receivables use collection methods that are viewed as unfair or abusive. In addition, our collections could suffer and we may incur additional expenses if we are required to change collection practices or stop collecting on certain debts as a result of a lawsuit or action on the part of regulators.The Dodd-Frank Act also may adversely affect the securitization market because it requires, among other things, that a securitizer must retain at least a 5% economic interest in the credit risk of the securitized assets. Furthermore, sponsors are prohibited from diluting the required risk retention by dividing the economic interest among multiple parties, or hedging or transferring the credit risk the sponsor is required to maintain. Moreover, the SEC’s significant changes to Regulation AB could result in sweeping changes to the commercial and residential mortgage loan securitization markets, as well as to the market for the re-securitization of mortgage-backed securities.Rules relating to securitizations rated by nationally-recognized statistical rating agencies (“NRSROs”) require that the findings of any third-party due diligence service providers be made publicly available at least five (5) business days prior to the first sale of securities, which may lead us to incur additional costs in connection with each securitization.On September 19, 2011, the SEC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking intended to implement the prohibition regarding material conflicts of interest relating to certain securitizations pursuant to Section 621 of the Dodd-Frank Act. At this time, we cannot predict what form the final rules and any related interpretive guidance from the SEC will take, or whether such rules would materially impact our business.A certain amount of the rule-making under the Dodd-Frank Act remains to be done. As a result, the complete impact of the Dodd-Frank Act remains uncertain. It is not clear what form some of these remaining regulations will ultimately take, or how our business will be affected. No assurance can be given that the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations or any other new legislative changes enacted will not have a significant impact on our business.For more information with respect to the regulatory framework affecting our businesses, see “Business—Regulation” included in Item 1.Investment Company Act considerations could affect our method of doing business.We intend to continue conducting our business operations so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”). We are a holding 23Table of Contentscompany that conducts its businesses primarily through wholly owned subsidiaries and are not an investment company because our subsidiaries are primarily engaged in the non-investment company business of consumer finance. Certain of our subsidiaries rely on exemptions from registration as an investment company, including pursuant to Sections 3(c)(4) and 3(c)(5) of the Investment Company Act. We rely on guidance published by the SEC staff or on our analyses of such guidance to determine our subsidiaries’ qualification under these and other exemptions. To the extent that the SEC staff publishes new or different guidance with respect to these matters, we may be required to adjust our business operations accordingly. Any additional guidance from the SEC staff could provide additional flexibility to us, or it could inhibit our ability to conduct our business operations. There can be no assurance that the laws and regulations governing the Investment Company Act status of real estate or real estate related assets or SEC guidance regarding Investment Company Act exemptions for real estate assets will not change in a manner that adversely affects our operations. If we fail to qualify for an exemption or exception from the Investment Company Act in the future, we could be required to restructure our activities or the activities of our subsidiaries, which could negatively affect us. In addition, if we or one or more of our subsidiaries fail to maintain compliance with the applicable exemptions or exceptions and we do not have another basis available to us on which we may avoid registration, and we were therefore required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we would become subject to substantial regulation with respect to our capital structure, management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons, holdings, and other matters, which could have an adverse effect on us.Real estate loan servicing and loan modifications have come under increasing scrutiny from government officials and others, which could make servicing our legacy real estate portfolio more costly and difficult.Real estate loan servicers have recently come under increasing scrutiny. In addition, some states and municipalities have passed laws that impose additional duties on foreclosing lenders and real estate loan servicers, such as mandatory mediation or extensive requirements for maintenance of vacant properties, which, in some cases, begin even before a lender has taken title to property. These additional requirements can delay foreclosures, make it uneconomical to foreclose on mortgaged real estate or result in significant additional costs, which could materially adversely affect the value of our portfolio. The CFPB finalized mortgage servicing regulations that became effective in January 2014, which makes it more difficult and expensive to service real estate loans.The U.S. Government has implemented a number of federal programs to assist homeowners, including the Home Affordable Modification Program (“HAMP”). Loans subserviced by Nationstar Mortgage LLC and Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. that are eligible for modification pursuant to HAMP guidelines are subject to HAMP. We have also implemented proprietary real estate loan modification programs in order to help real estate secured customers remain current on their loans. HAMP, our proprietary loan modification programs and other existing or future legislative or regulatory actions which result in the modification of outstanding real estate loans, may adversely affect the value of, and the returns on, our existing portfolio.RISKS RELATED TO THE ONEMAIN ACQUISITION AND THE LENDMARK SALEWe have incurred substantial transaction fees and costs in connection with the OneMain Acquisition.We have incurred a significant amount of costs in connection with the OneMain Acquisition, including legal, accounting and other expenses. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred following consummation of the OneMain Acquisition in the course of the integration of our businesses and the business of OneMain. We cannot be certain that the elimination of duplicative costs or the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the two businesses will offset the transaction and integration costs in the near term, or at all.The OneMain Acquisition may not achieve its intended results, and we may be unable to successfully integrate our and OneMain’s operations.We acquired OneMain with the expectation that the OneMain Acquisition will result in various benefits, including, among other things, cost savings and operating efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the OneMain Acquisition is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether our business and the business of OneMain can be integrated in an efficient and effective manner.It is possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of valuable employees, additional and unforeseen expenses, the disruption of our ongoing business, processes and systems, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, policies and compensation arrangements, any of which could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the OneMain Acquisition. There may be increased risk due to integrating financial reporting and internal control systems. Difficulties in combining operations of the two companies could also result in the loss of contract counterparties or other persons with whom we or OneMain conduct business and potential disputes or litigation with 24Table of Contentscontract counterparties or other persons with whom we or OneMain conduct business. Our results of operations following the OneMain Acquisition could also be adversely affected by any issues attributable to either company’s operations that arise or are based on events or actions that occurred prior to the closing of the OneMain Acquisition. The integration process is subject to a number of uncertainties, and no assurance can be given that the anticipated benefits, expense savings and synergies will be realized or, if realized, the timing of their realization. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues and could adversely affect our future business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.Since the closing of the OneMain Acquisition, we remain reliant on Citigroup, the former parent company of OMFH, to provide certain operational services and support to OneMain, and a failure by Citigroup to perform such services could materially increase our costs or disrupt our business, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.If the goodwill and other intangible assets that we recorded in connection with the OneMain Acquisition becomes impaired, it could have a negative impact on our profitability.Goodwill represents the amount of acquisition cost over the fair value of net assets we acquired in connection with the OneMain Acquisition. If the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Any such adjustments are reflected in our results of operations in the periods in which the impairments become known. At December 31, 2015, our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $1.4 billion and $559 million, respectively. While we have recorded no impairment charges on our goodwill and other intangible assets during 2015, there can be no assurance that our future evaluations of goodwill and other intangible assets will not result in findings of impairment and related write-downs, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.The Lendmark Sale may not be completed on the expected timeframe, or at all, and may be completed on terms less favorable than anticipated. In addition, the Branch Sellers and Lendmark may have difficulty fulfilling the terms of the Lendmark Sale.If OMH and its subsidiaries do not divest the branch assets within 120 days after November 13, 2015, as such time period may be extended pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the court may appoint a divestiture trustee to conduct the sale of such assets. (“Lendmark”, the “Lendmark Sale”, the “Branch Sellers” and the “Settlement Agreement” are described in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) In this case, the divestiture trustee would have the power to accomplish the divestiture of such assets to an acquirer or acquirers acceptable to the DOJ, and Springleaf would have no right to object to a sale by the divestiture trustee on any ground other than the divestiture trustee’s malfeasance. Accordingly, the asset divesture could occur on terms less favorable to Springleaf than the Lendmark Sale. In addition to the possibility that the Lendmark Sale will not be completed as expected or at all, (i) the Branch Sellers could have difficulty creating the technology platform that they are obligated to provide, (ii) Lendmark may have difficulty obtaining financing or licenses required for the purchase, and (iii) the Branch Sellers may have difficulty maintaining the branches to be sold in the ordinary course.Even if we are able to close the Lendmark Sale, the DOJ may impose additional conditions or penalties that could adversely affect us.Pursuant to the “Settlement Agreement” (as described in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8), we are subject to various obligations involving the operation of the branches to be sold in connection with the Lendmark Sale, including obligations that require us to take certain actions or to refrain from taking certain actions. In addition, we are required to dispose of the branches to be sold in connection with the Lendmark Sale within 120 days following November 13, 2015, subject to such extensions as the DOJ may approve. Even if we are able to consummate the Lendmark Sale prior to the deadline set forth in the Settlement Agreement, as such deadline may be extended in accordance with the terms of the Settlement Agreement, we could nevertheless be in technical violation of the Settlement Agreement and we could be subject to certain penalties, including but not limited to fines and/or injunctions. As we do not believe we will be able to consummate the Lendmark Sale prior to April 1, 2016, we have requested an extension of the closing deadline set forth in the Settlement Agreement and such extension request is pending with the DOJ. There can be no assurance that we will be granted an extension of the closing deadline by the DOJ or that we will not be assessed fine or penalties if we are unable to close the Lendmark Sale prior to the deadline set forth in the Settlement Agreement, as such deadline may be extended by the DOJ.25Table of ContentsRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESSAn inability to access adequate sources of liquidity may adversely affect our ability to fund operational requirements and satisfy financial obligations.Our ability to access capital and credit was significantly affected by the substantial disruption in the U.S. credit markets and the associated credit rating downgrades on our debt. In addition, the risk of volatility surrounding the global economic system and uncertainty surrounding regulatory reforms such as the Dodd-Frank Act continue to create uncertainty around access to the capital markets. Historically, we funded our operations and repaid our debt and other obligations using funds collected from our finance receivable portfolio and new debt issuances. Although market conditions have improved, for a number of years following the economic downturn and disruption in the credit markets, our traditional borrowing sources, including our ability to cost effectively issue large amounts of unsecured debt in the capital markets, particularly issuances of commercial paper, have generally not been available to us. Instead we have primarily raised capital through securitization transactions and, although there can be no assurances that we will be able to complete additional securitizations, we currently expect our near-term sources of capital markets funding to continue to derive from securitization transactions and unsecured debt offerings.If we are unable to complete additional securitization transactions on a timely basis or upon terms acceptable to us or otherwise access adequate sources of liquidity, our ability to fund our own operational requirements and satisfy financial obligations may be adversely affected.Our indebtedness is significant, which could affect our ability to meet our obligations under our debt instruments and could materially and adversely affect our business and ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry.We currently have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2015, we had $17.3 billion of indebtedness outstanding, including $7.7 billion of acquired debt as a result of the OneMain Acquisition. Interest expense on our indebtedness totaled $715 million in 2015.The amount of indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:•it may require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of the principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, which reduces the funds available for other purposes, including finance receivable originations;•it could limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing regulatory, business and economic conditions;•it may limit our ability to incur additional borrowings or securitizations for working capital, capital expenditures, business development, debt service requirements, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes, or to refinance our indebtedness;•it may require us to seek to change the maturity, interest rate and other terms of our existing debt;•it may place us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors that are proportionately not as highly leveraged;•it may cause a downgrade of our debt and long-term corporate ratings; and•it may cause us to be more vulnerable to periods of negative or slow growth in the general economy or in our business.In addition, meeting our anticipated liquidity requirements is contingent upon our continued compliance with our existing debt agreements. An event of default or declaration of acceleration under one of our existing debt agreements could also result in an event of default and declaration of acceleration under certain of our other existing debt agreements. Such an acceleration of our debt would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to continue as a going concern. If our debt obligations increase, whether due to the increased cost of existing indebtedness or the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the consequences described above could be magnified.There can be no assurance that we will be able to repay or refinance our debt in the future, including the debt of OneMain.26Table of ContentsCertain of our outstanding notes contain covenants that restrict our operations and may inhibit our ability to grow our business and increase revenues.SFC’s indenture and certain of SFC’s notes contain a covenant that limits SFC’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to create or incur liens. These restrictions do not apply to OMFH and its other subsidiaries. The restrictions may interfere with our ability to obtain new or additional financing or may affect the manner in which we structure such new or additional financing or engage in other business activities, which may significantly limit or harm our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. A default and resulting acceleration of obligations could also result in an event of default and declaration of acceleration under certain of our other existing debt agreements. Such an acceleration of our debt would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to continue as a going concern. A default could also significantly limit our alternatives to refinance both the debt under which the default occurred and other indebtedness. This limitation may significantly restrict our financing options during times of either market distress or our financial distress, which are precisely the times when having financing options is most important.The indenture governing OneMain’s unsecured debt (the “OMFH Indenture”) contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on OneMain and may limit our ability to integrate OneMain’s operations, including, but not limited to, restrictions on OMFH’s and its restricted subsidiaries’ ability to:•incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock;•make dividend payments or distributions on or purchases of OMFH’s equity interests;•make other restricted payments or investments;•create certain liens;•make certain dispositions of assets;•engage in certain transactions with affiliates;•sell certain securities of our subsidiaries;•in the case of such restricted subsidiaries, incur limitations on the ability to pay dividends or make other payments; and•merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of OneMain’s properties and assets.In addition, the OMFH Indenture includes a change of control repurchase provision which could require us to offer to repurchase all of the outstanding existing notes of OMFH issued thereunder. See “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness” for more information.The assessment of our liquidity is based upon significant judgments or estimates that could prove to be materially incorrect.In assessing our current financial position and developing operating plans for the future, management has made significant judgments and estimates with respect to our liquidity, including but not limited to:•our ability to generate sufficient cash to service all of our outstanding debt;•our continued ability to access debt and securitization markets and other sources of funding on favorable terms;•our ability to complete on favorable terms, as needed, additional borrowings, securitizations, finance receivable portfolio sales, or other transactions to support liquidity, and the costs associated with these funding sources, including sales at less than carrying value and limits on the types of assets that can be securitized or sold, which would affect profitability;•the potential for downgrade of our debt by rating agencies, which would have a negative impact on our cost of, and access to, capital;•our ability to comply with our debt covenants;27Table of Contents•the amount of cash expected to be received from our finance receivable portfolio through collections (including prepayments) and receipt of finance charges, which could be materially different than our estimates;•the potential for declining financial flexibility and reduced income should we use more of our assets for securitizations and finance receivable portfolio sales; and•the potential for reduced income due to the possible deterioration of the credit quality of our finance receivable portfolios.Additionally, there are numerous risks to our financial results, liquidity, and capital raising and debt refinancing plans that are not quantified in our current liquidity forecasts. These risks include, but are not limited, to the following:•our inability to grow our personal loan portfolio with adequate profitability to fund operations, loan losses, and other expenses;•our inability to monetize assets including, but not limited to, our access to debt and securitization markets;•our inability to obtain the additional necessary funding to finance the Company’s operations after the OneMain Acquisition;•the effect of federal, state and local laws, regulations, or regulatory policies and practices, including the Dodd-Frank Act (which, among other things, established the CFPB with broad authority to regulate and examine financial institutions), on our ability to conduct business or the manner in which we conduct business, such as licensing requirements, pricing limitations or restrictions on the method of offering products, as well as changes that may result from increased regulatory scrutiny of the sub-prime lending industry;•potential liability relating to real estate and personal loans which we have sold or may sell in the future, or relating to securitized loans, if it is determined that there was a non-curable breach of a warranty made in connection with the transaction;•the potential for increasing costs and difficulty in servicing our loan portfolio as a result of heightened nationwide regulatory scrutiny of loan servicing and foreclosure practices in the industry generally, and related costs that could be passed on to us in connection with the subservicing of our real estate loans that were originated or acquired centrally;•reduced cash receipts as a result of the liquidation of our real estate loan portfolio;•the potential for additional unforeseen cash demands or accelerations of obligations;•reduced income due to loan modifications where the borrower’s interest rate is reduced, principal payments are deferred, or other concessions are made;•the potential for declines in bond and equity markets; and•the potential effect on us if the capital levels of our regulated and unregulated subsidiaries prove inadequate to support current business plans.We intend to repay indebtedness with one or more of the following activities, among others: finance receivable collections, cash on hand, additional debt financings (particularly new securitizations and possible new issuances and/or debt refinancing transactions), finance receivable portfolio sales, or a combination of the foregoing. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in undertaking any of these activities to support our operations and repay our obligations.However, the actual outcome of one or more of our plans could be materially different than expected or one or more of our significant judgments or estimates about the potential effects of these risks and uncertainties could prove to be materially incorrect. In the event of such an occurrence, if third-party financing is not available, our liquidity could be substantially and materially affected, and as a result, substantial doubt could exist about our ability to continue as a going concern.28Table of ContentsCurrent ratings could adversely affect our ability to raise capital in the debt markets at attractive rates, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Each of Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”), Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”), and Fitch, Inc. (“Fitch”) rates SFC’s and OMFH’s debt. As a result of the announcement on March 3, 2015 relating to the proposed acquisition of OneMain from Citigroup, each of the rating agencies changed SFC’s ratings from a stable outlook to a negative watch. As of December 31, 2015, SFC’s long term corporate debt rating was rated B with a negative watch by S&P, B- with a stable outlook by Fitch and B3 with a stable outlook by Moody’s. As of December 31, 2015, OMFH’s long term corporate debt rating was rated B with a negative watch by S&P, B by Fitch and B2 with a stable outlook by Moody’s. Currently, no other OneMain or Springleaf entity has a corporate debt rating, though they may be rated in the future. Ratings reflect the rating agencies’ opinions of a company’s financial strength, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet our obligations. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating.If SFC’s or OMFH’s current ratings continue in effect or our ratings are downgraded, it will likely increase the interest rate that we would have to pay to raise money in the capital markets, making it more expensive for us to borrow money and adversely impacting our access to capital. As a result, our ratings could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our securitizations may expose us to financing and other risks, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to access the securitization market in the future, which may require us to seek more costly financing.We have securitized, and may in the future securitize, certain of our finance receivables to generate cash to originate or purchase new finance receivables or pay our outstanding indebtedness. In such transactions, we typically convey a pool of finance receivables to a special purpose entity (“SPE”), which, in turn, conveys the finance receivables to a trust (the issuing entity). Concurrently, the trust typically issues non-recourse notes or certificates pursuant to the terms of an indenture or pooling and servicing agreement, respectively, which then are transferred to the SPE in exchange for the finance receivables. The securities issued by the trust are secured by the pool of finance receivables. In exchange for the transfer of finance receivables to the issuing entity, we typically receive the cash proceeds from the sale of the trust securities, all residual interests, if any, in the cash flows from the finance receivables after payment of the trust securities, and a 100% beneficial interest in the issuing entity. As a result of the challenging credit and liquidity conditions, the value of any subordinated securities that we may retain in our securitizations might be reduced or, in some cases, eliminated.Although we have successfully completed a number of securitizations since 2012, the securitization market remains constrained, and we can give no assurances that we will be able to complete additional securitizations.SFC and OMFH currently act as the servicers with respect to the consumer loan securitization trusts and related series of asset-backed securities. If SFC or OMFH defaults in its servicing obligations, an early amortization event could occur with respect to the relevant asset-backed securities and SFC or OMFH could be replaced as servicer. Servicer defaults include, for example, the failure of the servicer to make any payment, transfer or deposit in accordance with the securitization documents, a breach of representations, warranties or agreements made by the servicer under the securitization documents and the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the servicer. Such an early amortization event could have materially adverse consequences on our liquidity and cost of funds.Rating agencies may also affect our ability to execute a securitization transaction, or increase the costs we expect to incur from executing securitization transactions, not only by deciding not to issue ratings for our securitization transactions, but also by altering the criteria and process they follow in issuing ratings. Rating agencies could alter their ratings processes or criteria after we have accumulated finance receivables for securitization in a manner that effectively reduces the value of those finance receivables by increasing our financing costs or otherwise requiring that we incur additional costs to comply with those processes and criteria. We have no ability to control or predict what actions the rating agencies may take.Further, other matters, such as (i) accounting standards applicable to securitization transactions and (ii) capital and leverage requirements applicable to banks and other regulated financial institutions holding residential mortgage-backed securities or other asset-backed securities, could result in decreased investor demand for securities issued through our securitization transactions, or increased competition from other institutions that undertake securitization transactions. In addition, compliance with certain regulatory requirements, including the Dodd-Frank Act and the Investment Company Act, may affect the type of securitizations that we are able to complete.29Table of ContentsIf it is not possible or economical for us to securitize our finance receivables in the future, we would need to seek alternative financing to support our operations and to meet our existing debt obligations, which may be less efficient and more expensive than raising capital via securitizations and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.RISKS RELATED TO OUR ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTUREIf the ownership of our common stock continues to be highly concentrated, it may prevent minority stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and may result in conflicts of interest.The Initial Stockholder, which is primarily owned by a private equity fund managed by an affiliate of Fortress, owns approximately 58% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, the Initial Stockholder owns shares sufficient for the majority vote over all matters requiring a stockholder vote, including: the election of directors; mergers, consolidations and acquisitions; the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other decisions affecting our capital structure; the amendment of our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws; and our winding up and dissolution. This concentration of ownership may delay, deter or prevent acts that would be favored by our other stockholders. The interests of the Initial Stockholder may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of our other stockholders. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of us. Also, the Initial Stockholder may seek to cause us to take courses of action that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment in us, but which might involve risks to our other stockholders or adversely affect us or our other stockholders. As a result, the market price of our common stock could decline or stockholders might not receive a premium over the then-current market price of our common stock upon a change in control. In addition, this concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in a company with significant stockholders.We are a holding company with no operations and rely on our operating subsidiaries to provide us with funds necessary to meet our financial obligations and to pay dividends.We are a holding company with no material direct operations. Our principal assets are the equity interests we directly or indirectly hold in our operating subsidiaries, which own our operating assets. As a result, we are dependent on loans, dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock. Our subsidiaries are legally distinct from us and may be prohibited or restricted from paying dividends or otherwise making funds available to us under certain conditions. For example, our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit their ability to pay dividends or make loans or advances to us, principally to protect policyholders, and certain of our debt agreements limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. If we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to, or our board may exercise its discretion not to, pay dividends.We do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.We have no plans to pay regular dividends on our common stock, and we anticipate that a significant amount of any free cash flow generated from our operations will be utilized to redeem or prepay outstanding indebtedness, and accordingly would not be available for dividends. Any declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant. Until such time that we pay a dividend, our investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. In addition, the OMFH Indenture contains certain restrictions on OMFH’s and its restricted subsidiaries’ ability to make dividend payments.Certain provisions of a stockholders agreement with our Initial Stockholder (the “Stockholders Agreement”), our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws could hinder, delay or prevent a change in control of us, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.Certain provisions of the Stockholders Agreement, our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors or Fortress. These provisions provide for:•a classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms;30Table of Contents•removal of directors only for cause and only with the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the voting interest of stockholders entitled to vote (provided, however, that for so long as Fortress and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least 30% of our issued and outstanding common stock (including Fortress’ proportionate interest in shares of our common stock held by the Initial Stockholder), directors may be removed with or without cause with the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting interest of stockholders entitled to vote);•provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws prevent stockholders from calling special meetings of our stockholders (provided, however, that for so long as Fortress and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least 20% of our issued and outstanding common stock (including Fortress’s proportionate interest in shares of our common stock held by the Initial Stockholder), any stockholders that collectively beneficially own at least 20% of our issued and outstanding common stock may call special meetings of our stockholders);•advance notice requirements by stockholders with respect to director nominations and actions to be taken at annual meetings;•certain rights to Fortress and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees with respect to the designation of directors for nomination and election to our board of directors, including the ability to appoint a majority of the members of our board of directors, plus one director, for so long as Fortress and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees continue to beneficially own, directly or indirectly at least 30% of our issued and outstanding common stock (including Fortress’s proportionate interest in shares of our common stock held by the Initial Stockholder);•no provision in our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws for cumulative voting in the election of directors, which means that the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock can elect all the directors standing for election;•our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws only permit action by our stockholders outside a meeting by unanimous written consent, provided, however, that for so long as Fortress and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least 20% of our issued and outstanding common stock (including Fortress’s proportionate interest in shares of our common stock held by the Initial Stockholder), our stockholders may act without a meeting by written consent of a majority of our stockholders; and•under our restated certificate of incorporation, our board of directors has authority to cause the issuance of preferred stock from time to time in one or more series and to establish the terms, preferences and rights of any such series of preferred stock, all without approval of our stockholders. Nothing in our restated certificate of incorporation precludes future issuances without stockholder approval of the authorized but unissued shares of our common stock.In addition, these provisions may make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a tender offer, change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by Fortress, our management or our board of directors. Public stockholders who might desire to participate in these types of transactions may not have an opportunity to do so, even if the transaction is favorable to stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to benefit from a change in control or change our management and board of directors and, as a result, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the ability of public stockholders to realize any potential change of control premium.Certain of our stockholders have the right to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses as us.Fortress and its affiliates, including the Initial Stockholder, engage in other investments and business activities in addition to their ownership of us. Under our restated certificate of incorporation, Fortress and its affiliates, including the Initial Stockholder, have the right, and have no duty to abstain from exercising such right, to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses as us, do business with any of our clients, customers or vendors or employ or otherwise engage any of our officers, directors or employees. If Fortress and its affiliates, including the Initial Stockholder, or any of their officers, directors or employees acquire knowledge of a potential transaction that could be a corporate opportunity, they have no duty, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to offer such corporate opportunity to us, our stockholders or our affiliates.In the event that any of our directors and officers who is also a director, officer or employee of any of Fortress or its affiliates, including the Initial Stockholder, acquires knowledge of a corporate opportunity or is offered a corporate opportunity, provided 31Table of Contentsthat this knowledge was not acquired solely in such person’s capacity as our director or officer and such person acts in good faith, then even if Fortress or its affiliates, including the Initial Stockholder, pursues or acquires the corporate opportunity or if Fortress or its affiliates, including the Initial Stockholder, do not present the corporate opportunity to us such person is deemed to have fully satisfied such person’s fiduciary duties owed to us and is not liable to us.Licensing and insurance laws and regulations may delay or impede purchases of our common stock.Certain of the states in which we are licensed to originate loans and the states in which Springleaf and OneMain insurance subsidiaries are domiciled (Indiana and Texas) have laws or regulations which require regulatory approval for the acquisition of “control” of regulated entities. In addition, these Indiana and Texas insurance laws and regulations generally provide that no person may acquire control, directly or indirectly, of a domiciled insurer, unless the person has provided the required information to, and the acquisition is subsequently approved or not disapproved by, the Indiana Department of Insurance and also by the Texas Department of Insurance. Under state insurance laws or regulations, there exists a presumption of “control” when an acquiring party acquires as little as 10% of the voting securities of a regulated entity or of a company which itself controls (directly or indirectly) a regulated entity (the threshold is 10% under the insurance statutes of Indiana and Texas). Therefore, any person acquiring 10% or more of our common stock may need the prior approval of these two state insurance and/or licensing regulators, or a determination from such regulators that “control” has not been acquired, which could significantly delay or otherwise impede their ability to complete such purchase.RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCKThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our stockholders.The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. If the market price of our common stock declines significantly, public stockholders may be unable to resell their shares at or above their purchase price, if at all. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include:•reaction to the OneMain Acquisition;•variations in our quarterly or annual operating results;•changes in our earnings estimates (if provided) or differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts;•the contents of published research reports about us or our industry or the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock after this offering;•additions to, or departures of, key management personnel;•any increased indebtedness we may incur in the future;•announcements by us or others and developments affecting us;•actions by institutional stockholders;•litigation and governmental investigations;•changes in market valuations of similar companies;•speculation or reports by the press or investment community with respect to us or our industry in general;•increases in market interest rates that may lead purchasers of our shares to demand a higher yield;•announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments; and32Table of Contents•general market, political and economic conditions, including any such conditions and local conditions in the markets in which our borrowers are located.These broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The stock market in general has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, including in recent months. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.Future offerings of debt or equity securities by us may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.In the future, we may attempt to obtain financing or to further increase our capital resources by issuing additional shares of our common stock or offering debt or other equity securities, including commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior or subordinated notes, debt securities convertible into equity or shares of preferred stock. In particular, we intend to continue to seek opportunities to acquire consumer finance portfolios and/or businesses that engage in consumer finance loan servicing and/or consumer finance loan originations. Future acquisitions could require substantial additional capital in excess of cash from operations. We would expect to finance the capital required for acquisitions through a combination of additional issuances of equity, corporate indebtedness, asset-backed acquisition financing and/or cash from operations.Issuing additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities or securities convertible into equity may dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders at the time of such issuance or reduce the market price of our common stock or both. Upon liquidation, holders of debt securities and preferred shares, if issued, and lenders with respect to other borrowings would receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. Debt securities convertible into equity could be subject to adjustments in the conversion ratio pursuant to which certain events may increase the number of equity securities issuable upon conversion. Preferred shares, if issued, could have a preference with respect to liquidating distributions or a preference with respect to dividend payments that could limit our ability to pay dividends to the holders of our common stock. Our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our common stock bear the risk that our future offerings may reduce the market price of our common stock and dilute their stockholdings in us.The market price of our common stock could be negatively affected by sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets.As of December 31, 2015, approximately 58% of our outstanding common stock is held by the Initial Stockholder and can be resold into the public markets in the future in accordance with the requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). A decline in the price of our common stock might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional common stock or other equity securities.The future issuance of additional common stock in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions or otherwise will dilute all other stockholdings.We have an aggregate of 1,865,256,280 shares of common stock authorized but unissued as of February 24, 2016. We may issue all of these shares of common stock without any action or approval by our stockholders, subject to certain exceptions. We also intend to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and may issue common stock in connection with these acquisitions. Any common stock issued in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions, the exercise of outstanding stock options or otherwise would dilute the percentage ownership held by our existing shareholders.Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable reports and prevent fraud.We believe that a control system, no matter how well designed and managed, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company 33Table of Contentshave been detected. We may not be able to identify all significant deficiencies and/or material weaknesses in our internal control in the future, and our failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects"

These risks are subject to contingencies which may or may not occur, and we are not able to express a view on the likelihood of any such contingency occurring. New risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our business or financial performance.RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSOur consolidated results of operations and financial condition and our borrowers’ ability to make payments on their loans have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by economic conditions and other factors that we cannot control.Uncertainty and negative trends in general economic conditions in the United States and abroad, including significant tightening of credit markets and a general decline in the value of real property, historically have created a difficult operating environment for our businesses and other companies in our industries. Many factors, including factors that are beyond our control, may impact our consolidated results of operations or financial condition and/or affect our borrowers’ willingness or capacity to make payments on their loans. These factors include: unemployment levels, housing markets, energy costs and interest rates; events such as natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, catastrophes, major medical expenses, divorce or death that affect our borrowers; and the quality of the collateral underlying our receivables. If we experience an economic downturn or if the U.S. economy is unable to continue or sustain its recovery from the most recent economic downturn, or if we become affected by other events beyond our control, we may experience a significant reduction in revenues, earnings and cash flows, difficulties accessing capital and a deterioration in the value of our investments. We may also become exposed to increased credit risk from our customers and third parties who have obligations to us.Moreover, our customers are primarily non-prime borrowers. Accordingly, such borrowers have historically been, and may in the future become, more likely to be affected, or more severely affected, by adverse macroeconomic conditions. If our borrowers default under a finance receivable held directly by us, we will bear a risk of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral, if any, and the outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest of the finance receivable, which could adversely affect our cash flow from operations. In addition, foreclosure of a real estate loan (part of our legacy real estate portfolio) is an expensive and lengthy process that can negatively affect our anticipated return on the foreclosed loan. The cost to service our loans may also increase without a corresponding increase in our finance charge income.Also, certain geographic concentrations of our loan portfolio may occur or increase as we adjust our risk and loss tolerance and strategy to achieve our profitability goals. Any geographic concentration may expose us to an increased risk of loss if that geographic region experiences higher unemployment rates than average, natural disasters, weak economic conditions, or other adverse economic factors that disproportionately affect that region.If aspects of our business, including the quality of our finance receivables portfolio or our borrowers, are significantly affected by economic changes or any other conditions in the future, we cannot be certain that our policies and procedures for underwriting, processing and servicing loans will adequately adapt to such changes. If we fail to adapt to changing economic conditions or other factors, or if such changes affect our borrowers’ willingness or capacity to repay their loans, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity would be materially adversely affected.As part of our growth strategy, we have committed to building our consumer lending business. If we are unable to successfully implement our growth strategy, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.We believe that our future success depends on our ability to implement our growth strategy, the key feature of which has been to shift our primary focus to originating consumer loans as well as acquiring portfolios of consumer loans and/or companies in the business of originating and servicing consumer loans or related products. In connection with this revised focus, we have also recently expanded into internet lending through our centralized operations.We may not be able to implement our new strategy successfully, and our success depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:•address the risks associated with our new focus on personal (including auto) loan receivables, including, but not limited to consumer demand for finance receivables, and changes in economic conditions and interest rates;13Table of Contents•address the risks associated with the new centralized method of originating and servicing our internet loans through our centralized operations, which represents a departure from our traditional high-touch branch- based servicing function and includes the potential for higher default and delinquency rates;•integrate, and develop the expertise required to capitalize on, our centralized operations;•obtain regulatory approval in connection with our internet lending;•obtain regulatory approval in connection with the acquisition of consumer loan portfolios and/or companies in the business of selling consumer loans or related products;•comply with regulations in connection with doing business and offering loan products over the internet, including various state and federal e-signature rules mandating that certain disclosures be made and certain steps be followed in order to obtain and authenticate e-signatures, with which we have limited experience;•successfully source, underwrite and integrate new acquisitions of loan portfolios and other businesses; and•successfully integrate OneMain if the Proposed Acquisition is completed.In order for us to realize the benefits associated with our new focus on originating and servicing consumer loans and grow our business, we must implement our strategic objectives in a timely and cost-effective manner as well as anticipate and address any risks to which we may become subject. In any event, we may not realize these benefits for many years, or our competitors may introduce more compelling products, services or enhancements. If we are not able to realize the benefits, or if we do not do so in a timely manner, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be negatively affected which would have a material adverse effect on business.There are risks associated with the acquisition of large loan portfolios, including the possibility of increased delinquencies and losses, difficulties with integrating the loans into our servicing platform and disruption to our ongoing business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We may acquire large portfolios of finance receivables in the future either through the direct purchase of such assets or the purchase of the equity of a company with such a portfolio. An example is the Proposed Acquisition. Since we will not have originated or serviced the loans we acquire, we may not be aware of legal or other deficiencies related to origination or servicing, and our review of the portfolio prior to purchase may not uncover those deficiencies. Further, we may have limited recourse against the seller of the portfolio.The ability to integrate and successfully service newly acquired loan portfolios will depend in large part on the success of our development and integration of expanded servicing capabilities, including additional personnel. We may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction if the integration process takes longer, or is more costly, than expected. Our failure to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating the acquired portfolios with our current business or otherwise to realize any of the anticipated benefits of the transaction, could impair our operations. In addition, the integration of future large portfolio acquisitions are complex, time-consuming and expensive processes that, without proper planning and effective and timely implementation, could significantly disrupt our business.Potential difficulties we may encounter during the integration process with future acquisitions include, but are not limited to, the following:•the integration of the portfolio into our information technology platforms and servicing systems;•the quality of servicing during any interim servicing period after we purchase a portfolio but before we assume servicing obligations from the seller or its agents;•the disruption to our ongoing businesses and distraction of our management teams from ongoing business concerns;•incomplete or inaccurate files and records;•the retention of existing customers;•the creation of uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems;•the occurrence of unanticipated expenses; and•potential unknown liabilities associated with the transactions, including legal liability related to origination and servicing prior to the acquisition.For example, in some cases loan files and other information (including servicing records) may be incomplete or inaccurate. If our employees are unable to access customer information easily, or if we are unable to produce originals or copies of documents or accurate information about the loans, collections could be affected significantly, and we may not be able to enforce our right to collect in some cases. Similarly, collections could be affected by any changes to our collection practices, the restructuring of any key servicing functions, transfer of files and other changes that would result from our assumption of the servicing of the acquired portfolios.14Table of ContentsThe anticipated benefits and synergies of our future acquisitions will assume a successful integration, and will be based on projections, which are inherently uncertain, as well as other assumptions. Even if integration is successful, anticipated benefits and synergies may not be achieved.There are risks associated with our ability to expand our centralized loan servicing capabilities through integration of the servicing facilities in Mendota Heights, Minnesota, and Tempe, Arizona, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.A key part of our efforts to expand our centralized loan servicing capacity will depend in large part on the success of management’s efforts to integrate the Minnesota and Arizona servicing facilities with our current operations. We may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of these facilities if the integration process takes longer, or is more costly, than expected. Our failure to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating these facilities with our current business or otherwise to realize any of the anticipated benefits could impair our operations. In addition, the integration is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process that, without proper planning and effective and timely implementation, could significantly disrupt our business. Potential difficulties we may encounter during the integration process may include, but are not limited to, the following:•the integration of the personnel with certain of our management teams, strategies, operations, products and services;•the integration of the physical facilities with our information technology platforms and servicing systems; and•the disruption to our ongoing businesses and distraction of our management teams from ongoing business concerns.If our estimates of finance receivable losses are not adequate to absorb actual losses, our provision for finance receivable losses would increase, which would adversely affect our results of operations.We maintain an allowance for finance receivable losses. To estimate the appropriate level of allowance for finance receivable losses, we consider known and relevant internal and external factors that affect finance receivable collectability, including the total amount of finance receivables outstanding, historical finance receivable charge-offs, our current collection patterns, and economic trends. Our methodology for establishing our allowance for finance receivable losses is based on the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 450 and, in part, on our historic loss experience. If customer behavior changes as a result of economic conditions and if we are unable to predict how the unemployment rate, housing foreclosures, and general economic uncertainty may affect our allowance for finance receivable losses, our provision may be inadequate. Our allowance for finance receivable losses is an estimate, and if actual finance receivable losses are materially greater than our allowance for finance receivable losses, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Neither state regulators nor federal regulators regulate our allowance for finance receivable losses. Additional information regarding our allowance for finance receivable losses is included in the section captioned “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Allowance for Finance Receivable Losses.”Our risk management efforts may not be effective.We could incur substantial losses and our business operations could be disrupted if we are unable to effectively identify, manage, monitor, and mitigate financial risks, such as credit risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk, liquidity risk, and other market-related risks, as well as operational risks related to our business, assets and liabilities. To the extent our models used to assess the creditworthiness of potential borrowers do not adequately identify potential risks, the valuations produced would not adequately represent the risk profile of the borrower and could result in a riskier finance receivable profile than originally identified. Our risk management policies, procedures, and techniques, including our scoring technology, may not be sufficient to identify all of the risks we are exposed to, mitigate the risks we have identified or identify concentrations of risk or additional risks to which we may become subject in the future.Our branch loan approval process is decentralized, which may result in variability of loan structures, and could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our branch finance receivable origination system is decentralized. We train our employees individually on-site in the branch to make loans that conform to our underwriting standards. Such training includes critical aspects of state and federal regulatory compliance, cash handling, account management and customer relations. Subject to approval by district managers and/or directors of operations in certain cases, our branch officers have the authority to approve and structure loans within broadly written underwriting guidelines rather than having all loan terms approved centrally. As a result, there may be variability in finance receivable structure (e.g., whether or not collateral is taken for the loan) and loan portfolios among branch offices or regions, even when underwriting policies are followed. Moreover, we cannot be certain that every loan is made in accordance with our underwriting standards and rules and we have in the past experienced some instances of loans extended that varied 15Table of Contentsfrom our underwriting standards. The nature of our approval process could adversely affect our operating results and variances in underwriting standards and lack of supervision could expose us to greater delinquencies and charge-offs than we have historically experienced, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Changes in market conditions, including rising interest rates, could adversely affect the rate at which our borrowers prepay their loans and the value of our finance receivables portfolio, as well as increase our financing cost, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Changing market conditions, including but not limited to, changes in interest rates, the availability of credit, the relative economic vitality of the area in which our borrowers and their assets are located, changes in tax laws, other opportunities for investment available to our customers, homeowner mobility, and other economic, social, geographic, demographic, and legal factors beyond our control, may affect the rates at which our borrowers prepay their loans. Generally, in situations where prepayment rates have slowed, the weighted-average life of our finance receivables has increased. Any increase in interest rates may further slow the rate of prepayment for our finance receivables, which could adversely affect our liquidity by reducing the cash flows from, and the value of, the finance receivables we hold for sale or utilize as collateral in our secured funding transactions.Moreover, the vast majority of our finance receivables are fixed-rate finance receivables, which generally decline in value if interest rates increase. As such, if changing market conditions cause interest rates to increase substantially, the value of our fixed-rate finance receivables could decline. In addition, rising interests rates will increase our cost of capital. Accordingly, any increase in interest rates could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We may be required to indemnify, or repurchase finance receivables from, purchasers of finance receivables that we have sold or securitized, or which we will sell or securitize in the future, if our finance receivables fail to meet certain criteria or characteristics or under other circumstances, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We have sold $6.4 billion of our legacy real estate portfolio in 2014 and have securitized $1.9 billion of our consumer loan portfolio and all of the SpringCastle Portfolio at December 31, 2014. The documents governing our finance receivable sales and securitizations contain provisions that require us to indemnify the purchasers of securitized finance receivables, or to repurchase the affected finance receivables, under certain circumstances. While our sale and securitization documents vary, they generally contain customary provisions that may require us to repurchase finance receivables if:•our representations and warranties concerning the quality and characteristics of the finance receivable are inaccurate;•there is borrower fraud; and•we fail to comply, at the individual finance receivable level or otherwise, with regulatory requirements in connection with the origination and servicing of the finance receivables.As a result of the current market environment, we believe that many purchasers of real estate loans (including through securitizations) are particularly aware of the conditions under which originators must indemnify purchasers or repurchase finance receivables, and would benefit from enforcing any repurchase remedies that they may have. At its extreme, our exposure to repurchases or our indemnification obligations under our representations and warranties could include the current unpaid balance of all finance receivables that we have sold or securitized and which are not subject to settlement agreements with purchasers.The risk of loss on the finance receivables that we have securitized is recognized in our allowance for finance receivable losses since all of our consumer loan securitizations are recorded on-balance sheet. If we are required to indemnify purchasers or repurchase finance receivables that we sell that result in losses that exceed our reserve for sales recourse, or recognize losses on securitized finance receivables that exceed our recorded allowance for finance receivable losses associated with our securitizations, this could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our insurance operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including claims, catastrophic events, underwriting risks and dependence on a sole distribution channel.Insurance claims and policyholder liabilities are difficult to predict and may exceed the related reserves set aside for claims (losses) and associated expenses for claims adjudication (loss adjustment expenses). Additionally, events such as hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes, pandemic disease, cyber security breaches and other types of catastrophes, and prolonged economic downturns, could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Other risks relating to our insurance 16Table of Contentsoperations include changes to laws and regulations applicable to us, as well as changes to the regulatory environment. Examples include changes to laws or regulations affecting capital and reserve requirements; frequency and type of regulatory monitoring and reporting; consumer privacy, use of customer data and data security; benefits or loss ratio requirements; insurance producer licensing or appointment requirements; required disclosures to consumers; and collateral protection insurance (i.e., insurance that our lender companies purchase, at the customer’s expense, on the customer’s loan collateral for the periods of time the borrower fails to adequately, as required by his loan, insure that collateral). Because our customers do not affirmatively consent to collateral protection insurance at the time it is purchased and hence, directly agree to the amount charged for it, regulators may in the future prohibit our insurance company from providing this insurance to our lending operations. Moreover, our insurance companies are dependent on our lending operations for the sole source of business and product distribution. If our lending operations discontinue offering insurance products, including as a result of regulatory requirements, our insurance operations would have no method of distribution for their products.We are a party to various lawsuits and proceedings which, if resolved in a manner adverse to us, could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.In the normal course of business, from time to time, we have been named as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with our business activities. Certain of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages, or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. Some of these proceedings are pending in jurisdictions that permit damage awards disproportionate to the actual economic damages alleged to have been incurred. The continued occurrences of large damage awards in general in the United States, including large punitive damage awards in certain jurisdictions that bear little or no relation to actual economic damages incurred by plaintiffs, create the potential for an unpredictable result in any given proceeding. A large judgment that is adverse to us could cause our reputation to suffer, encourage additional lawsuits against us and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.If we lose the services of any of our key management personnel, our business could suffer.Our future success significantly depends on the continued service and performance of our key management personnel. Competition for these employees is intense and we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel. We do not maintain any “key man” or other related insurance. The loss of the service of members of our senior management or key team members, or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed, could materially harm our business.Employee misconduct could harm us by subjecting us to monetary loss, significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm.Our reputation is critical to maintaining and developing relationships with our existing and potential customers and third parties with whom we do business. There is a risk that our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. For example, if an employee were to engage—or be accused of engaging—in illegal or suspicious activities including fraud or theft, we could suffer direct losses from the activity, and in addition we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial condition, customer relationships, and ability to attract future customers. Employee misconduct could prompt regulators to allege or to determine based upon such misconduct that we have not established adequate supervisory systems and procedures to inform employees of applicable rules or to detect and deter violations of such rules. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent misconduct may not be effective in all cases. Misconduct by our employees, or even unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct, could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business.Current and proposed regulation related to consumer privacy, data protection and information security could increase our costs.We are subject to a number of federal and state consumer privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations. For example, we are subject to the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which governs the use of personal financial information by financial institutions. Moreover, various federal and state regulatory agencies require us to notify customers in the event of a security breach. Federal and state legislators and regulators are increasingly pursuing new guidance, laws, and regulation. Compliance with current or future customer privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations could result in higher compliance, technology or other operating costs. Any violations of these laws and regulations may require us to change our business practices or operational structure, and could subject us to legal claims, monetary penalties, sanctions, and the obligation to indemnify and/or notify customers or take other remedial actions.17Table of ContentsSignificant disruptions in the operation of our information systems could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our business relies heavily on information systems to deliver products and services to our customers, and to manage our ongoing operations. These systems may encounter service disruptions due to system, network or software failure, security breaches, computer viruses, natural disasters or other reasons. There can be no assurance that our policies and procedures addressing these issues will adequately address the disruption. A disruption could impair our ability to offer and process consumer loans, provide customer service, perform collections activities or perform other necessary business activities, which could result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability.Security breaches in our information systems, in the information systems of third parties or in our branches, central servicing facilities, or our internet lending platform could adversely affect our reputation and could subject us to significant costs and regulatory penalties.Our operations rely heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential customer and other information in our computer systems and networks. Our branch offices and centralized servicing centers, as well as our administrative and executive offices, are part of an electronic information network that is designed to permit us to originate and track finance receivables and collections, and perform several other tasks that are part of our everyday operations. Our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious code that could result in disruption to our business, or the loss or theft of confidential information, including customer information. Any failure, interruption, or breach in our cyber security, including any failure of our back-up systems or failure to maintain adequate security surrounding customer information, could result in reputational harm, disruption in the management of our customer relationships, or the inability to originate, process and service our finance receivable products. Further, any of these cyber security and operational risks could result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to lawsuits by customers for identity theft or other damages resulting from the misuse of their personal information and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, regulators may impose penalties or require remedial action if they identify weaknesses in our security systems, and we may be required to incur significant costs to increase our cyber security to address any vulnerabilities that may be discovered or to remediate the harm caused by any security breaches. As part of our business, we may share confidential customer information and proprietary information with clients, vendors, service providers, and business partners. The information systems of these third parties may be vulnerable to security breaches and we may not be able to ensure that these third parties have appropriate security controls in place to protect the information we share with them. If our confidential information is intercepted, stolen, misused, or mishandled while in possession of a third party, it could result in reputational harm to us, loss of customer business, and additional regulatory scrutiny, and it could expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Although we have insurance that is intended to cover certain losses from such events, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate or available.Our branch offices and centralized servicing centers have physical customer records necessary for day-to-day operations that contain extensive confidential information about our customers, including financial and personally identifiable information. We also retain physical records in various storage locations outside of these locations. The loss or theft of customer information and data from our branch offices, central servicing facilities, or other storage locations could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and penalties, and could expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, if we cannot locate original documents (or copies, in some cases), we may not be able to collect on the finance receivables for which we do not have documents.We may not be able to make technological improvements as quickly as some of our competitors, which could harm our ability to compete with our competitors and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial and lending institutions to better serve customers and reduce costs. Our future success and, in particular, the success of our centralized operations, will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology- driven products and services as quickly as some of our competitors or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could harm our ability to compete with our competitors and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.18Table of ContentsWe could face environmental liability and costs for damage caused by hazardous waste (including the cost of cleaning up contaminated property) if we foreclose upon or otherwise take title to real estate pledged as collateral.If a real estate loan goes into default, we start foreclosure proceedings in appropriate circumstances, which could result in our taking title to the mortgaged real estate. We also consider alternatives to foreclosure, such as “short sales,” where we do not take title to mortgaged real estate. There is a risk that toxic or hazardous substances could be found on property after we take title. In addition, we own certain properties through which we operate our business, such as the buildings at our headquarters, and the servicing facility in London, Kentucky acquired on September 1, 2013. As the owner of any property where hazardous waste is present, we could be held liable for clean-up and remediation costs, as well as damages for any personal injuries or property damage caused by the condition of the property. We may also be responsible for these costs if we are in the chain of title for the property, even if we were not responsible for the contamination and even if the contamination is not discovered until after we have sold the property. Costs related to these activities and damages could be substantial. Although we have policies and procedures in place to investigate properties for potential hazardous substances before taking title to properties, these reviews may not always uncover potential environmental hazards.We ceased real estate lending and the purchase of retail finance contracts and are in the process of liquidating these portfolios, which subjects us to certain risks which if we do not effectively manage could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.In connection with our plan for strategic growth and new focus on consumer lending, we engaged in a number of restructuring initiatives, including but not limited to, ceasing real estate lending, ceasing purchasing retail sales contracts and revolving retail accounts from the sale of consumer goods and services by retail merchants, closing certain of our branches and reducing our workforce.Since terminating our real estate lending business at the beginning of 2012, which historically accounted for in excess of 50% of the interest income of our business, and ceasing retail sales purchases, we have been liquidating these legacy portfolios. In 2014, we entered into a series of transactions relating to the sales of our beneficial interests in our non-core real estate loans, the related servicing of these loans, and the sales of certain performing and non-performing real estate loans, which substantially completed our plan to liquidate our non-core real estate loans. Consequently, as of December 31, 2014 our real estate loans held for investment and held for sale totaled $625.3 million and $205.0 million, respectively. Due to the fact that we are no longer able to offer our remaining legacy real estate lending customers the same range of loan restructuring alternatives in delinquency situations that we may historically have extended to them, such customers may be less able, and less likely, to repay their loans.Moreover, if we fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the restructuring of our business and associated liquidation of our legacy portfolios, we may experience an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We are not able to track the default status of the senior lien loans for our second mortgages if we are not the holder of the senior loan.Second mortgages constituted 64% of our real estate loans as of December 31, 2014. In instances where we hold the second mortgage, either we or another creditor holds the first mortgage on the property, and our second mortgage is subordinate in right of payment to the first mortgage holder’s right to receive payment. If we are not the holder of the related first mortgage, we are not able to track the default status of a first mortgage for our second mortgages. In such instances, the value of our second mortgage may be lower than our records indicate and the provisions we maintain for finance receivable losses associated with such second mortgages may be inadequate.RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY AND REGULATIONWe operate in a highly competitive market, and we cannot ensure that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.The consumer finance industry is highly competitive. Our profitability depends, in large part, on our ability to originate finance receivables. We compete with other consumer finance companies as well as other types of financial institutions that offer similar products and services in originating finance receivables. Some of these competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we possess. Some competitors may also have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that may not be available to us. While banks and credit card companies have decreased their lending to non-prime customers in recent years, there is no assurance that such lenders will not resume those lending activities. Further, because of increased regulatory pressure on payday lenders, many of those lenders are starting to make more traditional 19Table of Contentsinstallment consumer loans in order to reduce regulatory scrutiny of their practices, which could increase competition in markets in which we operate. In addition, in July 2013, the Dodd-Frank Act’s three-year moratorium on banks affiliated with non-financial businesses expired. When the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted in 2010, a moratorium was imposed that prohibited the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation from approving deposit insurance for certain banks controlled by non-financial commercial enterprises. The expiration of the moratorium could result in an increase of traditionally non- financial enterprises entering the banking space, which could increase the number of our competitors. There can be no assurance that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our businesses are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business.Our businesses are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, and various state authorities regulate and supervise our insurance operations. The laws under which a substantial amount of our consumer and real estate businesses are conducted generally: provide for state licensing of lenders and, in some cases, licensing of employees involved in real estate loan modifications; impose limits on the term of a finance receivable, amounts, interest rates and charges on the finance receivables; regulate whether and under what circumstances insurance and other ancillary products may be offered to consumers in connection with a lending transaction; regulate the manner in which we use personal data; and provide for other consumer protections. We are also subject to extensive servicing regulations which we must comply with when servicing our legacy real estate loans and the SpringCastle Portfolio, and which we will have to comply with when we acquire loan portfolios in the future and assume the servicing obligations for the acquired loans. The extent of state regulation of our insurance business varies by product and by jurisdiction, but relates primarily to the following: licensing; conduct of business; periodic examination of the affairs of insurers; form and content of required financial reports; standards of solvency; limitations on dividend payments and other related party transactions; types of products offered; approval of policy forms and premium rates; permissible investments; deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders; reserve requirements for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes; and claims processing.All of our operations are subject to regular examination by state and federal regulators, and as a whole, our entities are subject to several hundred regulatory examinations in a given year. These examinations may result in requirements to change our policies or practices, and in some cases, we are required to pay monetary fines or make reimbursements to customers. Many state regulators and some federal regulators have indicated an intention to pool their resources in order to conduct examinations of licensed entities, including us, at the same time (referred to as a “multi-state” examination). This could result in more in-depth examinations, which could be more costly and lead to more significant enforcement actions.We are also subject to potential enforcement, supervisions and other actions that may be brought by state attorneys general or other state enforcement authorities and other governmental agencies. Any such actions could subject us to civil money penalties, customer remediation and increased compliance costs, as well as damage our reputation and brand and could limit or prohibit our ability to offer certain products and services or engage in certain business practices.The Department of Defense has proposed changes to the regulations that have been promulgated as a result of the Military Lending Act. If the changes are adopted, we would be subject to the limitations of the Military Lending Act, which places a 36% limitation on all fees, charges, interest rate and credit and non-credit insurance premiums for loans made to members of the military or their dependents.We believe that we maintain all material licenses and permits required for our current operations and are in substantial compliance with all applicable federal, state and local regulations, but we may not be able to maintain all requisite licenses and permits, and the failure to satisfy those and other regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, changes in laws or regulations applicable to us could subject us to additional licensing, registration and other regulatory requirements in the future or could adversely affect our ability to operate or the manner in which we conduct business.A material failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in regulatory actions, lawsuits and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.For more information with respect to the regulatory framework affecting our businesses, see “Business—Regulation” included in Item 1.20Table of ContentsThe enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act and the creation of the CFPB significantly increases our regulatory costs and burdens.The Dodd-Frank Act was adopted in 2010. This law, and the regulations already promulgated and to be promulgated under it, affect our operations in terms of increased oversight of financial services products by the CFPB, and the imposition of restrictions on the allowable terms for certain consumer credit transactions. The CFPB has significant authority to implement and enforce federal consumer finance laws, including the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act and new requirements for financial services products provided for in the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the authority to identify and prohibit unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provides the CFPB with broad supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over various consumer financial products and services, including the ability to require reimbursements and other payments to customers for alleged legal violations, and to impose significant penalties, as well as injunctive relief that prohibits lenders from engaging in allegedly unlawful practices. Further, state attorneys general and state regulators are authorized to bring civil actions to enforce certain consumer protection provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act and accompanying regulations are being phased in over time, and while some regulations have been promulgated, many others have not yet been proposed or finalized. We cannot predict the terms of all of the final regulations, their intended consequences or how such regulations will affect us or our industry.The CFPB currently has supervisory authority over our real estate servicing activities, and likely will have supervisory authority over our consumer lending business. It also has the authority to bring enforcement actions for violations of laws over which it has jurisdiction regardless of whether it has supervisory authority for a given product or service. The CFPB recently finalized mortgage servicing regulations that became effective in January 2014, which makes it more difficult and expensive to service mortgages. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act also gives the CFPB supervisory authority over entities that are designated as “larger participants” in certain financial services markets, including consumer installment loans and related products. The CFPB has not yet promulgated regulations that designate “larger participants” for consumer finance companies. If we are designated as a “larger participant” for this market, we also will be subject to supervision and examination by the CFPB with respect to our consumer loan business. The CFPB has published proposed regulations for “larger participants” in the market of auto finance. If those regulations are adopted as proposed, we would be a larger participant in the market of auto finance. The CFPB’s broad supervisory and enforcement powers could affect our business and operations significantly in terms of increased operating and regulatory compliance costs, and limits on the types of products we offer and the manner in which they are offered, among other things. See “Business—Regulation” for further information on the CFPB.The CFPB and certain state regulators recently have brought enforcement actions against lenders for the sale of ancillary products, such as “debt forgiveness” products that forgive a borrower’s debt if certain events occur (e.g., death or disability). Among other things, the regulators have questioned the cost of the product when compared to the benefits and whether the tactics used by the lender to sell the products mislead consumers. Although our insurance products are regulated by insurance regulators, sales of insurance could be challenged in a similar manner. In addition, we sell a few other ancillary products that are not considered to be insurance, and which could be subject to additional CFPB or state regulator scrutiny.Our use of third-party vendors is subject to increasing regulatory attention.Recently, the CFPB and other regulators have issued regulatory guidance that has focused on the need for financial institutions to perform increased due diligence and ongoing monitoring of third-party vendor relationships, thus increasing the scope of management involvement and decreasing the benefit that we receive from using third-party vendors. Moreover, if our regulators conclude that we have not met the heightened standards for oversight of our third-party vendors, we could be subject to enforcement actions, civil monetary penalties, supervisory orders to cease and desist or other remedial actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.We purchase and sell finance receivables, including charged off receivables and receivables where the borrower is in default. This practice could subject us to heightened regulatory scrutiny, which may expose us to legal action, cause us to incur losses and/or limit or impede our collection activity.As part of our business model, we purchase and sell finance receivables and plan to expand this practice in the future. Although the borrowers for some of these finance receivables are current on their payments, other borrowers may be in default (including in bankruptcy) or the debt may have been charged off as uncollectible. The CFPB and other regulators have recently significantly increased their scrutiny of the purchase and sale of debt, and collections practices undertaken by purchasers of debt, especially delinquent and charged off debt. The CFPB has criticized sellers of debt for not maintaining sufficient documentation to support and verify the validity or amount of the debt. It has also criticized debt collectors for, among other things, their collection tactics, attempting to collect debts that no longer are valid, misrepresenting the amount of the debt and not having sufficient documentation to verify the validity or amount of the debt. Our purchases or sales of receivables could 21Table of Contentsexpose us to lawsuits or fines by regulators if we do not have sufficient documentation to support and verify the validity and amount of the finance receivables underlying these transactions, or if we or purchasers of our finance receivables use collection methods that are viewed as unfair or abusive. In addition, our collections could suffer and we may incur additional expenses if we are required to change collection practices or stop collecting on certain debts as a result of a lawsuit or action on the part of regulators.The Dodd-Frank Act also may adversely affect the securitization market because it requires, among other things, that a securitizer generally retain not less than 5% of the credit risk for certain types of securitized assets that are transferred, sold, or conveyed through issuance of asset-backed securities. Moreover, the SEC has proposed significant changes to Regulation AB, which, if adopted in their present form, could result in sweeping changes to the commercial and residential mortgage loan securitization markets, as well as to the market for the re-securitization of mortgage-backed securities. The SEC also has proposed rules that would require issuers and underwriters to make any third-party due diligence reports on asset-backed securities publicly available. These changes could result in additional costs or limit our ability to securitize loans.For more information with respect to the regulatory framework affecting our businesses, see “Business—Regulation” included in Item 1.Investment Company Act considerations could affect our method of doing business.We intend to conduct our business operations so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”). We are a holding company that conducts its businesses primarily through wholly owned subsidiaries and are not an investment company because our subsidiaries are primarily engaged in the non-investment company business of consumer finance. Certain of our subsidiaries rely on exemptions from registration as an investment company, including pursuant to Sections 3(c)(4) and 3(c)(5) of the Investment Company Act. We rely on guidance published by the SEC staff or on our analyses of such guidance to determine our subsidiaries’ qualification under these and other exemptions. To the extent that the SEC staff publishes new or different guidance with respect to these matters, we may be required to adjust our business operations accordingly. Any additional guidance from the SEC staff could provide additional flexibility to us, or it could inhibit our ability to conduct our business operations. The SEC recently solicited public comment on a wide range of issues relating to certain exemptions from the Investment Company Act, including the nature of real estate or real estate related assets that qualify for purposes of certain exemptions. There can be no assurance that the laws and regulations governing the Investment Company Act status of real estate or real estate related assets or SEC guidance regarding Investment Company Act exemptions for real estate assets will not change in a manner that adversely affects our operations. If we fail to qualify for an exemption or exception from the Investment Company Act in the future, we could be required to restructure our activities or the activities of our subsidiaries, which could negatively affect us. In addition, if we or one or more of our subsidiaries fail to maintain compliance with the applicable exemptions or exceptions and we do not have another basis available to us on which we may avoid registration, and we were therefore required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we would become subject to substantial regulation with respect to our capital structure, management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons, holdings, and other matters, which could have an adverse effect on us.Real estate loan servicing and loan modifications have come under increasing scrutiny from government officials and others, which could make servicing our legacy real estate portfolio more costly and difficult.Real estate loan servicers have recently come under increasing scrutiny. In addition, some states and municipalities have passed laws that impose additional duties on foreclosing lenders and real estate loan servicers, such as mandatory mediation or extensive requirements for maintenance of vacant properties, which, in some cases, begin even before a lender has taken title to property. These additional requirements can delay foreclosures, make it uneconomical to foreclose on mortgaged real estate or result in significant additional costs, which could materially adversely affect the value of our portfolio. The CFPB recently finalized mortgage servicing regulations that became effective in January 2014, which makes it more difficult and expensive to service real estate loans.The U.S. Government has implemented a number of federal programs designed to assist homeowners, including the Home Affordable Modification Program (“HAMP”), which provides homeowners with assistance in avoiding residential real estate loan foreclosures. In third quarter 2009, our subsidiary, MorEquity, Inc. (“MorEquity”) entered into a Commitment to Purchase Financial Instrument and Servicer Participation Agreement with the Federal National Mortgage Association as financial agent for the United States Department of the Treasury, which provides for participation in HAMP. On February 1, 2011, MorEquity entered into subservicing agreements for the servicing of its real estate loans with Nationstar Mortgage LLC (“Nationstar”). Loans subserviced by Nationstar and servicers for certain securitized loans that are eligible for modification pursuant to HAMP guidelines are subject to HAMP. We also have implemented proprietary real estate loan modification programs in order to help 22Table of Contentscustomers in our branch segment remain current on their loans and avoid foreclosure. HAMP, our proprietary loan modification programs and other existing or future legislative or regulatory actions, including possible amendments to the bankruptcy laws, which result in the modification of outstanding real estate loans, may adversely affect the value of, and the returns on, our existing portfolio and the assets we acquire in the future.RISKS RELATED TO THE PROPOSED ACQUISITIONFailure to complete the Proposed Acquisition could negatively affect our share price, future business and financial results.Completion of the Proposed Acquisition is not assured and is subject to risks, including the risks that necessary regulatory approvals and clearances will not be obtained or that other closing conditions will not be satisfied. If the Proposed Acquisition is not completed, our ongoing business and financial results may be adversely affected and we will be subject to several risks, including:•having to pay certain significant transaction costs relating to the Proposed Acquisition without receiving the benefits of the Proposed Acquisition;•our share price may decline to the extent that the current market prices reflect an assumption by the market that the Proposed Acquisition will be completed;•we may be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Proposed Acquisition; and•if the Proposed Acquisition fails to close as a result of our failure to obtain antitrust approvals for, or resolve any objections of antitrust authorities to, the Proposed Acquisition, we will be required to pay the Seller a termination fee of $212.5 million.Delays in completing the Proposed Acquisition may substantially reduce the expected benefits of the Proposed Acquisition.Satisfying the conditions to, and completion of, the Proposed Acquisition may take longer than, and could cost more than, we expect. Any delay in completing or any additional conditions imposed (including those imposed by governmental entities in order to approve the Proposed Acquisition) in order to complete the Proposed Acquisition may materially adversely affect the synergies and other benefits that we expect to achieve from the Proposed Acquisition and the integration of our businesses. In addition, we and OneMain each have the right to terminate the Stock Purchase Agreement if the Proposed Acquisition is not completed by March 2, 2016, subject to extension by either party for three months if any required antitrust or state consumer finance or insurance regulatory approvals have not been obtained.We have agreed to take all action (including the divestiture, licensing or holding separate of assets) as may be necessary to resolve any antitrust objections to the Proposed Acquisition by governmental entities, except we will not be required to commit or agree to divest, license or hold separate assets of the Company and/or OneMain that account for more than $677 million in aggregate revenue of the Company and/or OneMain, as the case may be, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. Divestitures or licensing of assets can be time consuming and may delay or prevent completion of the Proposed Acquisition. Because potential buyers will likely be aware of the circumstances of the sale or license, these assets could be sold or licensed at prices or rates lower than their fair market value.We will incur substantial transaction fees and costs in connection with the Proposed Acquisition.We expect to incur a significant amount of non-recurring expenses in connection with the Proposed Acquisition, including legal, accounting and other expenses. In general, these expenses are payable by us whether or not the Proposed Acquisition is completed. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred following consummation of the Proposed Acquisition in the course of the integration of our businesses and the business of OneMain. We cannot be certain that the elimination of duplicative costs or the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the two businesses will offset the transaction and integration costs in the near term, or at all.In connection with the Proposed Acquisition, we may incur indebtedness that could have important consequences for our business and any investment in our securities.We are obligated to complete the Proposed Acquisition whether or not we consummate any related financing transactions. If we do incur debt in connection with the Proposed Acquisition, the incurrence of such indebtedness could have important consequences for our business and any investment in our securities, including increased risks related to our indebtedness. See “Risks Related to Our Indebtedness” for a discussion of the risks related to our indebtedness.23Table of ContentsIn addition, OneMain currently has a significant amount of indebtedness. The indenture governing OneMain’s unsecured debt contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on OneMain and may limit our ability to integrate OneMain’s operations, including, but not limited to, restrictions on OneMain’s ability to:•incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock;•make dividend payments or distributions on or purchases of OneMain’s equity interests;•make other restricted payments or investments;•create certain liens;•make certain dispositions of assets;•engage in certain transactions with affiliates;•sell securities of our subsidiaries;•create restrictions on OneMain’s restricted subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or make other payments; and•merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of OneMain’s properties and assets.We and OneMain will be subject to various uncertainties while the Proposed Acquisition is pending that could adversely affect our financial results or the anticipated benefits of the Proposed Acquisition.Uncertainty about the effect of the Proposed Acquisition on counterparties to contracts, employees and other parties may have an adverse effect on us or the anticipated benefits of the Proposed Acquisition. These uncertainties could cause contract counterparties and others who deal with us or OneMain to seek to change existing business relationships with us or OneMain, and may impair our and OneMain’s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Proposed Acquisition is completed and for a period of time thereafter. Employee retention and recruitment may be particularly challenging prior to completion of the Proposed Acquisition, as our employees and prospective employees, and the employees and prospective employees of OneMain, may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us following the Proposed Acquisition.The pursuit of the Proposed Acquisition and the preparation for the integration of the two companies may place a significant burden on management and internal resources. Any significant diversion of management attention away from ongoing business and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could affect our financial results prior to and/or following the completion of the Proposed Acquisition and could limit us from pursuing attractive business opportunities and making other changes to our business prior to completion of the Proposed Acquisition or termination of the Stock Purchase Agreement.Our assets, liabilities or results of operations could be adversely affected by known or unknown or unexpected events, conditions or actions that might occur at OneMain prior to the closing of the Proposed Acquisition.The OneMain assets, liabilities, business, financial condition, cash flows, operating results and prospects to be acquired or assumed by us by reason of the Proposed Acquisition could be adversely affected before or after the Proposed Acquisition closing as a result of known or previously unknown events or conditions occurring or existing before the Proposed Acquisition closing. Adverse changes in OneMain’s business or operations could occur or arise as a result of actions by OneMain, legal or regulatory developments including the emergence or unfavorable resolution of pre-acquisition loss contingencies, deteriorating general business, market, industry or economic conditions, and other factors both within and beyond the control of OneMain. A significant decline in the value of OneMain assets to be acquired by us or a significant increase in OneMain liabilities to be assumed by us could adversely affect our future business, financial condition, cash flows, operating results and prospects following the completion of the Proposed Acquisition.If completed, the Proposed Acquisition may not achieve its intended results, and we may be unable to successfully integrate our and OneMain’s operations.We entered into the Stock Purchase Agreement with the expectation that the Proposed Acquisition will result in various benefits, including, among other things, cost savings and operating efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the Proposed Acquisition is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether our business and the business of OneMain can be integrated in an efficient and effective manner.It is possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of valuable employees, additional and unforeseen expenses, the disruption of our ongoing business, processes and systems, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, policies and compensation arrangements, any of which could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Proposed Acquisition. There may be increased risk due to integrating financial reporting and internal control systems. Difficulties in combining operations of the two companies could also result in the loss of contract counterparties or other persons with whom we or OneMain conduct business and potential disputes or litigation with 24Table of Contentscontract counterparties or other persons with whom we or OneMain conduct business. Our results of operations following the Proposed Acquisition could also be adversely affected by any issues attributable to either company's operations that arise or are based on events or actions that occur prior to the closing of the Proposed Acquisition. The integration process is subject to a number of uncertainties, and no assurance can be given that the anticipated benefits, expense savings and synergies will be realized or, if realized, the timing of their realization. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues and could adversely affect our future business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, if consumer finance regulatory approvals are received in states representing ninety percent of all OneMain loans and all of the other conditions to the Proposed Acquisition closing have been satisfied, then, at the Seller’s option and subject to certain requirements and limitations, the parties will be obligated to effect the closing and we will be required to pay the full purchase price.  If this occurs, certain arrangements will need to be put in place to permit the closing, which could result in a disruption of OneMain’s operations and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operation.After the closing of the Proposed Acquisition, we will be reliant on the Seller to provide certain operational services and support to OneMain, and a failure by Seller to perform such services could materially increase our costs or disrupt our business, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESSAn inability to access adequate sources of liquidity may adversely affect our ability to fund operational requirements and satisfy financial obligations.Our ability to access capital and credit was significantly affected by the substantial disruption in the U.S. credit markets and the associated credit rating downgrades on our debt. In addition, the risk of volatility surrounding the global economic system and uncertainty surrounding regulatory reforms such as the Dodd-Frank Act continue to create uncertainty around access to the capital markets. Historically, we funded our operations and repaid our debt and other obligations using funds collected from our finance receivable portfolio and new debt issuances. Although market conditions have improved recently, for a number of years following the economic downturn and disruption in the credit markets, our traditional borrowing sources, including our ability to cost effectively issue large amounts of unsecured debt in the capital markets, particularly issuances of commercial paper, have generally not been available to us. Instead we have primarily raised capital through securitization transactions and, although there can be no assurances that we will be able to complete additional securitizations, we currently expect our near-term sources of capital markets funding to continue to derive from securitization transactions.If we are unable to complete additional securitization transactions on a timely basis or upon terms acceptable to us or otherwise access adequate sources of liquidity, our ability to fund our own operational requirements and satisfy financial obligations may be adversely affected.Our indebtedness is significant, which could affect our ability to meet our obligations under our debt instruments and could materially and adversely affect our business and ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry.We currently have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2014, we had $8.4 billion of indebtedness outstanding (including securitizations and secured indebtedness). Interest expense on our indebtedness was $734.0 million in 2014. There can be no assurance that we will be able to repay or refinance our debt in the future.The amount of indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:•it may require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of the principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, which reduces the funds available for other purposes, including finance receivable originations;•it could limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing regulatory, business and economic conditions;•it may limit our ability to incur additional borrowings or securitizations for working capital, capital expenditures, business development, debt service requirements, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes, or to refinance our indebtedness;•it may require us to seek to change the maturity, interest rate and other terms of our existing debt;•it may cause a further downgrade of our debt and long-term corporate ratings; and25Table of Contents•it may cause us to be more vulnerable to periods of negative or slow growth in the general economy or in our business.In addition, meeting our anticipated liquidity requirements is contingent upon our continued compliance with our existing debt agreements. An event of default or declaration of acceleration under one of our existing debt agreements could also result in an event of default and declaration of acceleration under certain of our other existing debt agreements. Such an acceleration of our debt would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to continue as a going concern. Furthermore, our existing debt agreements do not restrict us from incurring significant additional indebtedness. If our debt obligations increase, whether due to the increased cost of existing indebtedness or the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the consequences described above could be magnified.Certain of our outstanding notes contain covenants that restrict our operations and may inhibit our ability to grow our business and increase revenues.SFC’s indenture and certain of SFC’s notes contain a covenant that limits SFC’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to create or incur liens. These restrictions do not generally apply to us or SFI and its subsidiaries. The restrictions may interfere with our ability to obtain new or additional financing or may affect the manner in which we structure such new or additional financing or engage in other business activities, which may significantly limit or harm our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. A default and resulting acceleration of obligations could also result in an event of default and declaration of acceleration under certain of our other existing debt agreements. Such an acceleration of our debt would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to continue as a going concern. A default could also significantly limit our alternatives to refinance both the debt under which the default occurred and other indebtedness. This limitation may significantly restrict our financing options during times of either market distress or our financial distress, which are precisely the times when having financing options is most important.The assessment of our liquidity is based upon significant judgments or estimates that could prove to be materially incorrect.In assessing our current financial position and developing operating plans for the future, management has made significant judgments and estimates with respect to our liquidity, including but not limited to:•our ability to generate sufficient cash to service all of our outstanding debt;•our continued ability to access debt and securitization markets and other sources of funding on favorable terms;•our ability to complete on favorable terms, as needed, additional borrowings, securitizations, finance receivable portfolio sales, or other transactions to support liquidity, and the costs associated with these funding sources, including sales at less than carrying value and limits on the types of assets that can be securitized or sold, which would affect profitability;•the potential for downgrade of our debt by rating agencies, which would have a negative impact on our cost of, and access to, capital;•our ability to finance the Proposed Acquisition;•our ability to comply with our debt covenants;•the amount of cash expected to be received from our finance receivable portfolio through collections (including prepayments) and receipt of finance charges, which could be materially different than our estimates;•the potential for declining financial flexibility and reduced income should we use more of our assets for securitizations and finance receivable portfolio sales; and•the potential for reduced income due to the possible deterioration of the credit quality of our finance receivable portfolios.Additionally, there are numerous risks to our financial results, liquidity, and capital raising and debt refinancing plans that are not quantified in our current liquidity forecasts. These risks include, but are not limited, to the following:•our inability to grow our personal loan portfolio with adequate profitability to fund operations, loan losses, and other expenses;•our inability to monetize assets including, but not limited to, our access to debt and securitization markets;•our inability to obtain the additional necessary funding to finance the Company’s operations after the Proposed Acquisition;•the effect of federal, state and local laws, regulations, or regulatory policies and practices, including the Dodd-Frank Act (which, among other things, established the CFPB with broad authority to regulate and examine financial institutions), on our ability to conduct business or the manner in which we conduct business, such as licensing 26Table of Contentsrequirements, pricing limitations or restrictions on the method of offering products, as well as changes that may result from increased regulatory scrutiny of the sub-prime lending industry;•potential liability relating to real estate and personal loans which we have sold or may sell in the future, or relating to securitized loans, if it is determined that there was a non-curable breach of a warranty made in connection with the transaction;•the potential for increasing costs and difficulty in servicing our loan portfolio as a result of heightened nationwide regulatory scrutiny of loan servicing and foreclosure practices in the industry generally, and related costs that could be passed on to us in connection with the subservicing of our real estate loans that were originated or acquired centrally;•reduced cash receipts as a result of the liquidation of our real estate loan portfolio;•the potential for additional unforeseen cash demands or accelerations of obligations;•reduced income due to loan modifications where the borrower’s interest rate is reduced, principal payments are deferred, or other concessions are made;•the potential for declines in bond and equity markets; and•the potential effect on us if the capital levels of our regulated and unregulated subsidiaries prove inadequate to support current business plans.We intend to repay indebtedness with one or more of the following activities, among others: finance receivable collections, cash on hand, additional debt financings (particularly new securitizations and possible new issuances and/or debt refinancing transactions), finance receivable portfolio sales, or a combination of the foregoing. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in undertaking any of these activities to support our operations and repay our obligations.However, the actual outcome of one or more of our plans could be materially different than expected or one or more of our significant judgments or estimates about the potential effects of these risks and uncertainties could prove to be materially incorrect. In the event of such an occurrence, if third-party financing is not available, our liquidity could be substantially and materially affected, and as a result, substantial doubt could exist about our ability to continue as a going concern.Current ratings could adversely affect our ability to raise capital in the debt markets at attractive rates, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Each of Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”), Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”), and Fitch, Inc. (“Fitch”) rates SFC’s debt. As of December 31, 2014, SFC’s long term corporate debt rating was rated B with a stable outlook by S&P, B with a stable outlook by Fitch and B2 with a stable outlook by Moody’s. As a result of the announcement on March 3, 2015 relating to the Proposed Acquisition, each of the rating agencies changed SFC’s ratings from a stable outlook to a negative watch. Currently, no other Springleaf entity has a corporate debt rating, though they may be rated in the future. Ratings reflect the rating agencies’ opinions of a company’s financial strength, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet our obligations. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating.If SFC’s current ratings continue in effect or our ratings are downgraded, it will likely increase the interest rate that we would have to pay to raise money in the capital markets, making it more expensive for us to borrow money and adversely impacting our access to capital. As a result, our ratings could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our securitizations may expose us to financing and other risks, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to access the securitization market in the future, which may require us to seek more costly financing.We have securitized, and may in the future securitize, certain of our finance receivables to generate cash to originate or purchase new finance receivables or pay our outstanding indebtedness. In each such transaction, we convey a pool of finance receivables to a special purpose entity (“SPE”), which, in turn, conveys the finance receivables to a trust (the issuing entity). Concurrently, the trust issued non-recourse notes or certificates pursuant to the terms of an indenture or pooling and servicing agreement, respectively, which then are transferred to the SPE in exchange for the finance receivables. The securities issued by the trust are secured by the pool of finance receivables. In exchange for the transfer of finance receivables to the issuing entity, we receive the cash proceeds from the sale of the trust securities, all residual interests, if any, in the cash flows from the finance receivables after payment of the trust securities, and a 100% beneficial interest in the issuing entity. As a result of the challenging credit and liquidity conditions, the value of the subordinated securities we retain in our securitizations might be reduced or, in some cases, eliminated.Although we have successfully completed a number of securitizations since 2012, the securitization market remains constrained, and we can give no assurances that we will be able to complete additional securitizations.27Table of ContentsSFC currently acts as servicer with respect to its consumer loan securitization trusts and related series of asset-backed securities. If SFC defaults in its servicing obligations, an early amortization event could occur with respect to the relevant asset-backed securities and SFC could be replaced as servicer. Servicer defaults include, for example, the failure of the servicer to make any payment, transfer or deposit in accordance with the securitization documents, a breach of representations, warranties or agreements made by the servicer under the securitization documents and the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the servicer. Such an early amortization event could have materially adverse consequences on our liquidity and cost of funds.Rating agencies may also affect our ability to execute a securitization transaction, or increase the costs we expect to incur from executing securitization transactions, not only by deciding not to issue ratings for our securitization transactions, but also by altering the criteria and process they follow in issuing ratings. Rating agencies could alter their ratings processes or criteria after we have accumulated finance receivables for securitization in a manner that effectively reduces the value of those finance receivables by increasing our financing costs or otherwise requiring that we incur additional costs to comply with those processes and criteria. We have no ability to control or predict what actions the rating agencies may take.Further, other matters, such as (i) accounting standards applicable to securitization transactions and (ii) capital and leverage requirements applicable to banks and other regulated financial institutions holding residential mortgage-backed securities or other asset-backed securities, could result in decreased investor demand for securities issued through our securitization transactions, or increased competition from other institutions that undertake securitization transactions. In addition, compliance with certain regulatory requirements, including the Dodd-Frank Act and the Investment Company Act, may affect the type of securitizations that we are able to complete.If it is not possible or economical for us to securitize our finance receivables in the future, we would need to seek alternative financing to support our operations and to meet our existing debt obligations, which may be less efficient and more expensive than raising capital via securitizations and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.RISKS RELATED TO OUR ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTUREIf the ownership of our common stock continues to be highly concentrated, it may prevent minority stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and may result in conflicts of interest.The Initial Stockholder, which is primarily owned by a private equity fund managed by an affiliate of Fortress, owns approximately 75% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, the Initial Stockholder owns shares sufficient for the majority vote over all matters requiring a stockholder vote, including: the election of directors; mergers, consolidations and acquisitions; the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other decisions affecting our capital structure; the amendment of our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws; and our winding up and dissolution. This concentration of ownership may delay, deter or prevent acts that would be favored by our other stockholders. The interests of the Initial Stockholder may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of our other stockholders. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of us. Also, the Initial Stockholder may seek to cause us to take courses of action that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment in us, but which might involve risks to our other stockholders or adversely affect us or our other stockholders. As a result, the market price of our common stock could decline or stockholders might not receive a premium over the then-current market price of our common stock upon a change in control. In addition, this concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in a company with significant stockholders.We are a holding company with no operations and will rely on our operating subsidiaries to provide us with funds necessary to meet our financial obligations and to pay dividends.We are a holding company with no material direct operations. Our principal assets are the equity interests we directly or indirectly hold in our operating subsidiaries, which own our operating assets. As a result, we are dependent on loans, dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock. Our subsidiaries are legally distinct from us and may be prohibited or restricted from paying dividends or otherwise making funds available to us under certain conditions. For example, our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit their ability to pay dividends or make loans or advances to us, principally to protect policyholders, and certain of our debt agreements limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. If we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to, or our board may exercise its discretion not to, pay dividends.28Table of ContentsWe do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.We have no plans to pay regular dividends on our common stock, and we anticipate that a significant amount of any free cash flow generated from our operations will be utilized to redeem or prepay outstanding indebtedness, and accordingly would not be available for dividends. Any declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant. Until such time that we pay a dividend, our investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.Certain provisions of a stockholders agreement with our Initial Stockholder (the “Stockholders Agreement”), our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws could hinder, delay or prevent a change in control of us, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.Certain provisions of the Stockholders Agreement, our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors or Fortress. These provisions provide for:•a classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms;•removal of directors only for cause and only with the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the voting interest of stockholders entitled to vote (provided, however, that for so long as Fortress and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least 30% of our issued and outstanding common stock (including Fortress’ proportionate interest in shares of our common stock held by the Initial Stockholder), directors may be removed with or without cause with the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting interest of stockholders entitled to vote);•provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws prevent stockholders from calling special meetings of our stockholders (provided, however, that for so long as Fortress and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least 20% of our issued and outstanding common stock (including Fortress’ proportionate interest in shares of our common stock held by the Initial Stockholder), any stockholders that collectively beneficially own at least 20% of our issued and outstanding common stock may call special meetings of our stockholders);•advance notice requirements by stockholders with respect to director nominations and actions to be taken at annual meetings;•certain rights to Fortress and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees with respect to the designation of directors for nomination and election to our board of directors, including the ability to appoint a majority of the members of our board of directors, plus one director, for so long as Fortress and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees continue to beneficially own, directly or indirectly at least 30% of our issued and outstanding common stock (including Fortress’s proportionate interest in shares of our common stock held by the Initial Stockholder);•no provision in our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws for cumulative voting in the election of directors, which means that the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock can elect all the directors standing for election;•our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws only permit action by our stockholders outside a meeting by unanimous written consent, provided, however, that for so long as Fortress and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least 20% of our issued and outstanding common stock (including Fortress’s proportionate interest in shares of our common stock held by the Initial Stockholder), our stockholders may act without a meeting by written consent of a majority of our stockholders; and•under our restated certificate of incorporation, our board of directors has authority to cause the issuance of preferred stock from time to time in one or more series and to establish the terms, preferences and rights of any such series of preferred stock, all without approval of our stockholders. Nothing in our restated certificate of incorporation precludes future issuances without stockholder approval of the authorized but unissued shares of our common stock.In addition, these provisions may make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a tender offer, change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by Fortress, our management or our board of directors. Public stockholders who might desire to participate in these types of transactions may not have an opportunity to do so, even if the transaction is favorable to stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to benefit from a 29Table of Contentschange in control or change our management and board of directors and, as a result, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the ability of public stockholders to realize any potential change of control premium.Certain of our stockholders have the right to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses as us.Fortress and AIG and their respective affiliates, including the Initial Stockholder, engage in other investments and business activities in addition to their ownership of us. Under our restated certificate of incorporation, Fortress and AIG and their respective affiliates, including the Initial Stockholder, have the right, and have no duty to abstain from exercising such right, to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses as us, do business with any of our clients, customers or vendors or employ or otherwise engage any of our officers, directors or employees. If Fortress and AIG and their respective affiliates, including the Initial Stockholder, or any of their officers, directors or employees acquire knowledge of a potential transaction that could be a corporate opportunity, they have no duty, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to offer such corporate opportunity to us, our stockholders or our affiliates.In the event that any of our directors and officers who is also a director, officer or employee of any of Fortress, AIG or their respective affiliates, including the Initial Stockholder, acquires knowledge of a corporate opportunity or is offered a corporate opportunity, provided that this knowledge was not acquired solely in such person’s capacity as our director or officer and such person acts in good faith, then even if Fortress or AIG or their respective affiliates, including the Initial Stockholder, pursues or acquires the corporate opportunity or if Fortress or AIG or their respective affiliates, including the Initial Stockholder, do not present the corporate opportunity to us such person is deemed to have fully satisfied such person’s fiduciary duties owed to us and is not liable to us.Licensing and insurance laws and regulations may delay or impede purchases of our common stock.Certain of the states in which we are licensed to originate loans and the state in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled (Indiana) have laws or regulations which require regulatory approval for the acquisition of “control” of regulated entities. In addition, the insurance laws and regulations in Indiana generally provide that no person may acquire control, directly or indirectly, of a domiciled insurer, unless the person has provided required information to, and the acquisition is approved or not disapproved by, the Indiana Department of Insurance. Under some state laws or regulations, there exists a presumption of “control” when an acquiring party acquires as little as 10% of the voting securities of a regulated entity or of a company which itself controls (directly or indirectly) a regulated entity (the threshold is 10% under Indiana’s insurance statutes). Therefore, any person acquiring 10% or more of our common stock may need the prior approval of some state insurance and/or licensing regulators, or a determination from such regulators that “control” has not been acquired, which could significantly delay or otherwise impede their ability to complete such purchase.RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCKThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our stockholders.The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. If the market price of our common stock declines significantly, public stockholders may be unable to resell their shares at or above their purchase price, if at all. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include:•reaction to the Proposed Acquisition;•variations in our quarterly or annual operating results;•changes in our earnings estimates (if provided) or differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts;•the contents of published research reports about us or our industry or the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock after this offering;•additions to, or departures of, key management personnel;•any increased indebtedness we may incur in the future;•announcements by us or others and developments affecting us;•actions by institutional stockholders;•litigation and governmental investigations;•changes in market valuations of similar companies;•speculation or reports by the press or investment community with respect to us or our industry in general;30Table of Contents•increases in market interest rates that may lead purchasers of our shares to demand a higher yield;•announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments; and•general market, political and economic conditions, including any such conditions and local conditions in the markets in which our borrowers are located.These broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The stock market in general has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, including in recent months. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.Future offerings of debt or equity securities by us may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.In the future, we may attempt to obtain financing or to further increase our capital resources by issuing additional shares of our common stock or offering debt or other equity securities, including commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior or subordinated notes, debt securities convertible into equity or shares of preferred stock. In particular, we intend to continue to seek opportunities to acquire consumer finance portfolios and/or businesses that engage in consumer finance loan servicing and/or consumer finance loan originations. Future acquisitions could require substantial additional capital in excess of cash from operations. We would expect to finance the capital required for acquisitions through a combination of additional issuances of equity, corporate indebtedness, asset-backed acquisition financing and/or cash from operations.Issuing additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities or securities convertible into equity may dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders at the time of such issuance or reduce the market price of our common stock or both. Upon liquidation, holders of debt securities and preferred shares, if issued, and lenders with respect to other borrowings would receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. Debt securities convertible into equity could be subject to adjustments in the conversion ratio pursuant to which certain events may increase the number of equity securities issuable upon conversion. Preferred shares, if issued, could have a preference with respect to liquidating distributions or a preference with respect to dividend payments that could limit our ability to pay dividends to the holders of our common stock. Our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our common stock bear the risk that our future offerings may reduce the market price of our common stock and dilute their stockholdings in us.The market price of our common stock could be negatively affected by sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets.Approximately 75% of our outstanding common stock is held by the Initial Stockholder and can be resold into the public markets in the future in accordance with the requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). A decline in the price of our common stock might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional common stock or other equity securities.The future issuance of additional common stock in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions or otherwise will dilute all other stockholdings.We have an aggregate of 1,885,167,105 shares of common stock authorized but unissued. We may issue all of these shares of common stock without any action or approval by our stockholders, subject to certain exceptions. We also intend to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and may issue common stock in connection with these acquisitions. Any common stock issued in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions, the exercise of outstanding stock options or otherwise would dilute the percentage ownership held by our existing shareholders.As a public company, we will incur additional costs and face increased demands on our management.As a newly public company with shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”), we are required to comply with an extensive body of regulations, including certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), regulations of the SEC and requirements of the NYSE. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, as a result of becoming a public company, we have added independent directors and created additional board committees. In addition, we may incur additional costs associated with our public company reporting requirements and maintaining directors’ and officers’ liability insurance. 31Table of ContentsWe are currently continuing to evaluate and monitor developments with respect to these rules, which may impose additional costs on us and materially affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.A material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.As a U.S.-listed public company, we are required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Section 404 requires that we complete an annual assessment of our internal control over financial reporting to enable management to report on the operating effectiveness of those controls. In addition, we are required to have our independent registered public accounting firm provide an opinion regarding the operating effectiveness of our internal controls. As discussed under “Item 9A. Controls and Procedures,” our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2014, due to the existence of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, management was unable to complete the process for assessing that certain spreadsheet and report controls operated effectively due to insufficient documentation demonstrating compliance with the control design.  Such controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance to management as to the completeness and accuracy of inputs, assumptions and formulas included in certain spreadsheets and reports used in the preparation and analysis of accounting and financial information. We have taken and continue to take steps to remediate the underlying cause of this material weakness. However, we cannot provide any assurance that these remediation efforts will be successful or that they will cause our internal control over financial reporting to be effective.We also cannot provide any assurance that our internal control over financial reporting will be operating effectively in the future. If we are not able to maintain or document effective internal control over financial reporting, our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to opine as to the operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the required dates. Matters affecting our internal controls over financial reporting may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis, or may cause us to restate previously issued financial information, and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions or investigations by the SEC, or violations of the NYSE listing rules. There also could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of our financial statements also is likely to suffer if we or our independent registered public accounting firm reports a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. This could materially adversely affect us by, for example, leading to a decline in our share price and impairing our ability to raise capital"
9,OMF,ONEMAIN HOLDINGS INC,2014-04-15,"  Risk Factors
. We face a variety of risks that are inherent in our business. Accordingly, you should carefully consider the following discussion of risks in addition to the other information regarding our business provided in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC. These risks are subject to contingencies which may or may not occur, and we are not able to express a view on the likelihood of any such contingency occurring. New risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our business or financial performance. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS Our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and our borrowers ability to make payments on their loans have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by economic conditions and other factors that we cannot control. Uncertainty and negative trends in general economic conditions in the United States and abroad, including significant tightening of credit markets and a general decline in the value of real property, historically have created a difficult operating environment for our businesses and other companies in our industries. Many factors, including factors that are beyond our control, may impact our consolidated results of operations or financial condition and/or affect our borrowers willingness or capacity to make payments on their loans. These factors include: unemployment levels, housing markets, energy costs and interest rates; events such as natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, catastrophes, major medical expenses, divorce or death that affect our borrowers; and the quality of the collateral underlying our receivables. If we experience an economic downturn or if the U.S. economy is unable to continue or sustain its recovery from the most recent economic downturn, or if we become affected by other events beyond our control, we may experience a significant reduction in revenues, earnings and cash flows, difficulties accessing capital and a deterioration in the value of our investments. We may also become exposed to increased credit risk from our customers and third parties who have obligations to us. Moreover, our customers are primarily non-prime borrowers. Accordingly, such borrowers have historically been, and may in the future become, more likely to be affected, or more severely affected, by adverse macroeconomic conditions. If our borrowers default under a finance receivable held directly by us, we will bear a risk of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral, if any, and the outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest of the finance receivable, which could adversely affect our cash flow from operations. In addition, foreclosure of a real estate loan (part of our legacy real estate portfolio) is an expensive and lengthy process that can negatively affect our anticipated return on the foreclosed loan. The cost to service our loans may also increase without a corresponding increase in our finance charge income. If aspects of our business, including the quality of our finance receivables portfolio or our borrowers, are significantly affected by economic changes or any other conditions in the future, we cannot be certain that our policies and procedures for underwriting, processing and servicing loans will adequately adapt to such changes. If we fail to adapt to changing economic conditions or other factors, or if such changes affect our borrowers willingness or capacity to repay their loans, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity would be materially adversely affected. 15Table of Contents As part of our growth strategy, we have committed to building our consumer lending business. If we are unable to successfully implement our growth strategy, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected. We believe that our future success depends on our ability to implement our growth strategy, the key feature of which has been to shift our primary focus to originating consumer loans as well as acquiring portfolios of consumer loans, such as our SpringCastle Portfolio that we acquired through our Springleaf Acquisitions division. In connection with this revised focus, we have also recently expanded into internet lending through our iLoan division. We may not be able to implement our new strategy successfully, and our success depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to: ·                  address the risks associated with our new focus on personal loan receivables, including, but not limited to consumer demand for finance receivables, and changes in economic conditions and interest rates;·                  address the risks associated with the new centralized method of originating and servicing our internet loans through our iLoan division, which represents a departure from our traditional high-touch branch- based servicing function and includes the potential for higher default and delinquency rates;·                  integrate, and develop the expertise required to capitalize on, our iLoan division;·                  comply with regulations in connection with doing business and offering loan products over the internet, including various state and federal e-signature rules mandating that certain disclosures be made and certain steps be followed in order to obtain and authenticate e-signatures, with which we have limited experience; and·                  successfully source, underwrite and integrate new acquisitions of loan portfolios and of other businesses. In order for us to realize the benefits associated with our new focus on originating and servicing consumer loans and grow our business, we must implement our strategic objectives in a timely and cost-effective manner as well as anticipate and address any risks to which we may become subject. If we are not able to do so, or if we do not do so in a timely manner, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be negatively affected which would have a material adverse effect on business. We ceased real estate lending and the purchase of retail finance contracts and are in the process of liquidating these portfolios, which subjects us to certain risks which if we do not effectively manage could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In connection with our plan for strategic growth and new focus on consumer lending, we engaged in a number of restructuring initiatives, including but not limited to, ceasing real estate lending, ceasing purchasing retail sales contracts and revolving retail accounts from the sale of consumer goods and services by retail merchants, closing certain of our branches and reducing our workforce. Since terminating our real estate lending business at the beginning of 2012, which historically accounted for in excess of 50% of the interest income of our business, and ceasing retail sales purchases, we have begun the multi-year process of liquidating these legacy portfolios. However, notwithstanding our decision to exit real estate lending and retail sales and the liquidating status of these portfolios, as of December 31, 2013 our real estate loans totaled $8.0 billion. The continuation or worsening of volatility in residential real estate values could continue to adversely affect our business and results of operations, and such adverse conditions could result in significant write-downs in the future. Similarly, due to the fact that we are no longer able to offer our legacy real estate lending customers the same range of loan  16Table of Contents restructuring alternatives in delinquency situations that we may historically have extended to them, such customers may be less able, and less likely, to repay their loans. We may be unable to efficiently manage our restructuring and the liquidation of our legacy portfolios. In particular, we may not achieve the cost-savings and operational synergies expected as a result of closing certain of our branches and reducing personnel. Similarly, we may be unable to originate or acquire new consumer loans via our branches and over the internet at a level that is sufficient to offset the impact that liquidating our real estate and retail sales portfolios may have on our financial condition. If we fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the restructuring of our business and associated liquidation of our legacy portfolios, we may experience an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. There are risks associated with the acquisition of large loan portfolios, such as the SpringCastle Portfolio, including the possibility of increased delinquencies and losses, difficulties with integrating the loans into our servicing platform and disruption to our ongoing business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. On April 1, 2013, we acquired the SpringCastle Portfolio, a $3.9 billion consumer loan portfolio consisting of over 415,000 unsecured loans and loans secured by subordinate residential real estate mortgages (which we service as unsecured loans due to the fact that the liens are subordinated to superior ranking security interests). We acquired the portfolio from HSBC through a newly formed joint venture in which we own a 47% equity interest. In the future, we may acquire additional large portfolios of finance receivables either through the direct purchase of such assets or the purchase of the equity of a company with such a portfolio. Since we will not have originated or serviced the loans we acquire, including the SpringCastle Portfolio, we may not be aware of legal or other deficiencies related to origination or servicing, and our review of the portfolio prior to purchase may not uncover those deficiencies. Further, we may have limited recourse against the seller of the portfolio. The ability to integrate and service the SpringCastle Portfolio successfully will depend in large part on the success of our development and integration of expanded servicing capabilities, including additional personnel, with our current operations. Similar integration issues are likely to occur with future large portfolio acquisitions. We may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction if the integration process takes longer, or is more costly, than expected. Our failure to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating the SpringCastle Portfolio with our current business or otherwise to realize any of the anticipated benefits of the transaction, could impair our operations. In addition, the integration of the SpringCastle Portfolio and other future large portfolio acquisitions are complex, time-consuming and expensive processes that, without proper planning and effective and timely implementation, could significantly disrupt our business. 17Table of Contents Potential difficulties we may encounter during the integration process with the SpringCastle Portfolio or future acquisitions include, but are not limited to, the following: ·                  the integration of the portfolio into our information technology platforms and servicing systems;·                  the quality of servicing during any interim servicing period after we purchase a portfolio but before we assume servicing obligations from the seller or its agents;·                  the disruption to our ongoing businesses and distraction of our management teams from ongoing business concerns;·                  incomplete or inaccurate files and records;·                  the retention of existing customers;·                  the creation of uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems;·                  the occurrence of unanticipated expenses; and·                  potential unknown liabilities associated with the transactions, including legal liability related to origination and servicing prior to the acquisition. For example, in some cases loan files and other information related to the SpringCastle Portfolio (including servicing records) are incomplete or inaccurate. If our employees are unable to access customer information easily, or if we are unable to produce originals or copies of documents or accurate information about the loans, collections could be affected significantly, and we may not be able to enforce our right to collect in some cases. Similarly, collections could be affected by any changes to our collection practices, the restructuring of any key servicing functions, transfer of files and other changes that resulted from our assumption of the servicing of the SpringCastle Portfolio in September 2013. The anticipated benefits and synergies from the acquisition and servicing of the SpringCastle Portfolio assume, and our future acquisitions will assume, a successful integration, and are or will be based on projections, which are inherently uncertain, as well as other assumptions. Even if integration is successful, anticipated benefits and synergies may not be achieved. 18Table of Contents There are risks associated with our ability to expand our centralized loan servicing capabilities through integration of the mortgage servicing facility in Dallas, Texas which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. A key part of our efforts to expand our centralized loan servicing capacity will depend in large part on the success of managements efforts to integrate the Texas Facility with our current operations. We may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of this facility if the integration process takes longer, or is more costly, than expected. Our failure to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating the Texas Facility with our current business or otherwise to realize any of the anticipated benefits could impair our operations. In addition, the integration is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process that, without proper planning and effective and timely implementation, could significantly disrupt our business. Potential difficulties we may encounter during the integration process may include, but are not limited to, the following: ·                  the integration of the personnel with certain of our management teams, strategies, operations, products and services;·                  the integration of the physical facilities with our information technology platforms and servicing systems; and·                  the disruption to our ongoing businesses and distraction of our management teams from ongoing business concerns. If our estimates of finance receivable losses are not adequate to absorb actual losses, our provision for finance receivable losses would increase, which would adversely affect our results of operations. We maintain an allowance for finance receivable losses. To estimate the appropriate level of allowance for finance receivable losses, we consider known and relevant internal and external factors that affect finance receivable collectability, including the total amount of finance receivables outstanding, historical finance receivable charge-offs, our current collection patterns, and economic trends. Our methodology for establishing our allowance for finance receivable losses is based on the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 450 and, in part, on our historic loss experience. If customer behavior changes as a result of economic conditions and if we are unable to predict how the unemployment rate, housing foreclosures, and general economic uncertainty may affect our allowance for finance receivable losses, our provision may be inadequate. Our allowance for finance receivable losses is an estimate, and if actual finance receivable losses are materially greater than our allowance for finance receivable losses, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Neither state regulators nor federal regulators regulate our allowance for finance receivable losses. Additional information regarding our allowance for finance receivable losses is included in the section captioned Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsAllowance for Finance Receivable Losses. Our risk management efforts may not be effective. We could incur substantial losses and our business operations could be disrupted if we are unable to effectively identify, manage, monitor, and mitigate financial risks, such as credit risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk, liquidity risk, and other market-related risks, as well as operational risks related to our business, assets and liabilities. To the extent our models used to assess the creditworthiness of potential borrowers do not adequately identify potential risks, the valuations produced would not adequately represent the risk profile of the borrower and could result in a riskier finance receivable profile than originally identified. Our risk management policies, procedures, and techniques, including our scoring technology, may not be sufficient to identify all of the risks we are exposed to, mitigate the risks we have identified or identify concentrations of risk or additional risks to which we may become subject in the future. 19Table of Contents Our branch loan approval process is decentralized, which may result in variability of loan structures, and could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our branch finance receivable origination system is decentralized. We train our employees individually on-site in the branch to make loans that conform to our underwriting standards. Such training includes critical aspects of state and federal regulatory compliance, cash handling, account management and customer relations. Subject to approval by district managers and/or directors of operations in certain cases, our branch officers have the authority to approve and structure loans within broadly written underwriting guidelines rather than having all loan terms approved centrally. As a result, there may be variability in finance receivable structure (e.g., whether or not collateral is taken for the loan) and loan portfolios among branch offices or regions, even when underwriting policies are followed. Moreover, we cannot be certain that every loan is made in accordance with our underwriting standards and rules and we have in the past experienced some instances of loans extended that varied from our underwriting standards. The nature of our approval process could adversely affect our operating results and variances in underwriting standards and lack of supervision could expose us to greater delinquencies and charge-offs than we have historically experienced, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Changes in market conditions, including rising interest rates, could adversely affect the rate at which our borrowers prepay their loans and the value of our finance receivables portfolio, as well as increase our financing cost, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Changing market conditions, including but not limited to, changes in interest rates, the availability of credit, changes in housing prices, the relative economic vitality of the area in which our borrowers and their assets are located, changes in tax laws, other opportunities for investment available to our customers, homeowner mobility, and other economic, social, geographic, demographic, and legal factors beyond our control, may affect the rates at which our borrowers prepay their loans. Generally, in situations where prepayment rates have slowed, the weighted-average life of our finance receivables has increased. However, the current challenging economic conditions and recent significant declines in home values (and the resulting loss of homeowner equity) has limited many homeowners ability to refinance mortgage loans and reduced prepayment rates for real estate loans, even in the current low interest rate environment. Any increase in interest rates may further slow the rate of prepayment for our finance receivables, which could adversely affect our liquidity by reducing the cash flows from, and the value of, the finance receivables we hold for sale or utilize as collateral in our secured funding transactions. Moreover, the vast majority of our finance receivables are fixed-rate finance receivables, which generally decline in value if interest rates increase. As such, if changing market conditions cause interest rates to increase substantially, the value of our fixed-rate finance receivables could decline. In addition, rising interests rates will increase our cost of capital. Accordingly, any increase in interest rates could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We may be required to indemnify, or repurchase finance receivables from, purchasers of finance receivables that we have sold or securitized, or which we will sell or securitize in the future, if our finance receivables fail to meet certain criteria or characteristics or under other circumstances, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We have securitized a large part of our legacy real estate portfolio and have started to securitize our consumer portfolio. In addition, we have sold finance receivables from time to time. The documents governing our finance receivable sales and securitizations contain provisions that require us to indemnify the purchasers of securitized finance receivables, or to repurchase the affected finance receivables, under  20Table of Contents certain circumstances. While our sale and securitization documents vary, they generally contain customary provisions that may require us to repurchase finance receivables if: ·                  our representations and warranties concerning finance receivable quality and circumstances are inaccurate, including representations concerning the licensing of a mortgage broker;·                  there is borrower fraud or if a payment default occurs on a finance receivable shortly after its origination;·                  we fail to comply, at the individual finance receivable level or otherwise, with regulatory requirements; and·                  in limited instances, an individual finance receivable reaches certain defined finance delinquency limits. As a result of the current market environment, we believe that many purchasers of real estate loans (including through securitizations) are particularly aware of the conditions under which originators must indemnify purchasers or repurchase finance receivables, and would benefit from enforcing any repurchase remedies that they may have. At its extreme, our exposure to repurchases or our indemnification obligations under our representations and warranties could include the current unpaid balance of all finance receivables that we have sold or securitized and which are not subject to settlement agreements with purchasers. The risk of loss on the finance receivables that we have securitized is recognized in our allowance for finance receivable losses since all of our securitizations are recorded on-balance sheet. If we are required to indemnify purchasers or repurchase finance receivables that we sell that result in losses that exceed our reserve for sales recourse, or recognize losses on securitized finance receivables that exceed our recorded allowance for finance receivable losses associated with our securitizations, this could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our insurance operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including claims, catastrophic events, underwriting risks and dependence on a sole distribution channel. Insurance claims and policyholder liabilities are difficult to predict and may exceed the related reserves set aside for claims (losses) and associated expenses for claims adjudication (loss adjustment expenses). Additionally, events such as hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes, pandemic disease, cyber security breaches and other types of catastrophes, and prolonged economic downturns, could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Other risks relating to our insurance operations include changes to laws and regulations applicable to us, as well as changes to the regulatory environment. Examples include changes to laws or regulations affecting capital and reserve requirements; frequency and type of regulatory monitoring and reporting; consumer privacy, use of customer data and data security; benefits or loss ratio requirements; insurance producer licensing or appointment requirements; and required disclosures to consumers; and collateral protection insurance (i.e., insurance that our lender companies purchase, at the customers expense, on the customers loan collateral for the periods of time the borrower fails to adequately, as required by his loan, insure that collateral). Because our customers do not affirmatively consent to collateral protection insurance at the time it is purchased and hence, directly agree to the amount charged for it, regulators may in the future prohibit our insurance company from providing this insurance to our lending operations. Moreover, our insurance companies are dependent on our lending operations for the sole source of business and product distribution. If our lending operations discontinue offering insurance products, including as a result of regulatory requirements, our insurance operations would have no method of distribution for their products. 21Table of Contents We are a party to various lawsuits and proceedings which, if resolved in a manner adverse to us, could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We are a party to various legal proceedings, including certain purported class action claims, arising in the ordinary course of our business. Some of these proceedings are pending in jurisdictions that permit damage awards disproportionate to the actual economic damages alleged to have been incurred. The continued occurrences of large damage awards in general in the United States, including large punitive damage awards in certain jurisdictions that bear little or no relation to actual economic damages incurred by plaintiffs, create the potential for an unpredictable result in any given proceeding. A large judgment that is adverse to us could cause our reputation to suffer, encourage additional lawsuits against us and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. If we lose the services of any of our key management personnel, our business could suffer. Our future success significantly depends on the continued service and performance of our key management personnel. Competition for these employees is intense and we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel. We do not maintain any key man or other related insurance. The loss of the service of members of our senior management or key team members, or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed, could materially harm our business. Employee misconduct could harm us by subjecting us to monetary loss, significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm. Our reputation is critical to maintaining and developing relationships with our existing and potential customers and third parties with whom we do business. There is a risk that our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. For example, if an employee were to engageor be accused of engagingin illegal or suspicious activities including fraud or theft, we could suffer direct losses from the activity, and in addition we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial condition, customer relationships, and ability to attract future customers. Employee misconduct could prompt regulators to allege or to determine based upon such misconduct that we have not established adequate supervisory systems and procedures to inform employees of applicable rules or to detect and deter violations of such rules. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent misconduct may not be effective in all cases. Misconduct by our employees, or even unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct, could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business. Security breaches in our information systems, in the information systems of third parties or in our branches, central servicing facilities, or our internet lending platform could adversely affect our reputation and could subject us to significant costs and regulatory penalties. Our operations rely heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential customer and other information in our computer systems and networks. Our branch offices, centralized servicing centers and our iLoan division, as well as our administrative and executive offices, are part of an electronic information network that is designed to permit us to originate and track finance receivables and collections, and perform several other tasks that are part of our everyday operations. Our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious code that could result in disruption to our business, or the loss or theft of confidential information, including customer information. Any failure, interruption, or breach in our cyber security, including any failure of our back-up systems or failure to maintain adequate security surrounding customer information, could result in reputational harm, disruption in the management of our customer relationships, or the inability to originate, process and service our finance receivable products. 22Table of Contents Further, any of these cyber security and operational risks could result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to lawsuits by customers for identity theft or other damages resulting from the misuse of their personal information and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, regulators may impose penalties or require remedial action if they identify weaknesses in our security systems, and we may be required to incur significant costs to increase our cyber security to address any vulnerabilities that may be discovered or to remediate the harm caused by any security breaches. As part of our business, we may share confidential customer information and proprietary information with clients, vendors, service providers, and business partners. The information systems of these third parties may be vulnerable to security breaches and we may not be able to ensure that these third parties have appropriate security controls in place to protect the information we share with them. If our confidential information is intercepted, stolen, misused, or mishandled while in possession of a third party, it could result in reputational harm to us, loss of customer business, and additional regulatory scrutiny, and it could expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Although we have insurance that is intended to cover certain losses from such events, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate or available. Our branch offices and centralized servicing centers have physical customer records necessary for day-to-day operations that contain extensive confidential information about our customers, including financial and personally identifiable information. We also retain physical records in various storage locations outside of these locations. The loss or theft of customer information and data from our branch offices, central servicing facilities, or other storage locations could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and penalties, and could expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, if we cannot locate original documents (or copies, in some cases), we may not be able to collect on the finance receivables for which we do not have documents. We may not be able to make technological improvements as quickly as some of our competitors, which could harm our ability to compete with our competitors and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial and lending institutions to better serve customers and reduce costs. Our future success and, in particular, the success of our iLoan division, will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology- driven products and services as quickly as some of our competitors or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could harm our ability to compete with our competitors and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We could face environmental liability and costs for damage caused by hazardous waste (including the cost of cleaning up contaminated property) if we foreclose upon or otherwise take title to real estate pledged as collateral. If a real estate loan goes into default, we start foreclosure proceedings in appropriate circumstances, which could result in our taking title to the mortgaged real estate. We also consider alternatives to foreclosure, such as short sales, where we do not take title to mortgaged real estate. There is a risk that  23Table of Contents toxic or hazardous substances could be found on property after we take title. In addition, we own certain properties through which we operate our business, such as the buildings at our headquarters, and the Kentucky Facility acquired on September 1, 2013. As the owner of any property where hazardous waste is present, we could be held liable for clean-up and remediation costs, as well as damages for any personal injuries or property damage caused by the condition of the property. We may also be responsible for these costs if we are in the chain of title for the property, even if we were not responsible for the contamination and even if the contamination is not discovered until after we have sold the property. Costs related to these activities and damages could be substantial. Although we have policies and procedures in place to investigate properties for potential hazardous substances before taking title to properties, these reviews may not always uncover potential environmental hazards. We are not able to track the default status of the senior lien loans for our second mortgages if we are not the holder of the senior loan. Second mortgages constituted 6% of our real estate loans as of December 31, 2013. In instances where we hold the second mortgage, either we or another creditor holds the first mortgage on the property, and our second mortgage is subordinate in right of payment to the first mortgage holders right to receive payment. If we are not the holder of the related first mortgage, we are not able to track the default status of a first mortgage for our second mortgages. In such instances, the value of our second mortgage may be lower than our records indicate and the provisions we maintain for finance receivable losses associated with such second mortgages may be inadequate. We may be required to take impairment charges for intangible assets. As a result of our future quarterly reviews and evaluation of our intangible assets for potential impairment, we may be required to take an impairment charge to the extent that the carrying values of our intangible assets exceed their fair value. Also, if we sell a business for less than the carrying value of the assets sold, including intangible assets attributable to that business, we may be required to take an impairment charge on all or part of the intangible assets attributable to that business. We have recognized impairments on certain intangible assets in 2012 and 2011. Although we did not recognize any impairments on our intangible assets in 2013, we cannot give assurances that we will not have to recognize additional material impairment charges in the future. See Notes 8 and 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further information on the impairments of our intangible assets. RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY AND REGULATION We operate in a highly competitive market, and we cannot ensure that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The consumer finance industry is highly competitive. Our profitability depends, in large part, on our ability to originate finance receivables. We compete with other consumer finance companies as well as other types of financial institutions that offer similar products and services in originating finance receivables. Some of these competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we possess. Some competitors may also have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that may not be available to us. While banks and credit card companies have decreased their lending to non-prime customers in recent years, there is no assurance that such lenders will not resume those lending activities. Further, because of increased regulatory pressure on payday lenders, many of those lenders are starting to make more traditional installment consumer loans in order to reduce regulatory scrutiny of 24Table of Contents their practices, which could increase competition in markets in which we operate. In addition, in July 2013, the Dodd-Frank Acts three-year moratorium on banks affiliated with non-financial businesses expired. When the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted in 2010, a moratorium was imposed that prohibited the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation from approving deposit insurance for certain banks controlled by non-financial commercial enterprises. The expiration of the moratorium could result in an increase of traditionally non- financial enterprises entering the banking space, which could increase the number of our competitors. There can be no assurance that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our businesses are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Our businesses are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, and various state authorities regulate and supervise our insurance operations. The laws under which a substantial amount of our consumer and real estate businesses are conducted generally: provide for state licensing of lenders and, in some cases, licensing of employees involved in real estate loan modifications; impose limits on the term of a finance receivable, amounts, interest rates and charges on the finance receivables; regulate whether and under what circumstances insurance and other ancillary products may be offered to consumers in connection with a lending transaction; regulate the manner in which we use personal data; and provide for other consumer protections. We are also subject to extensive servicing regulations which we must comply with when servicing our legacy real estate loans and the SpringCastle Portfolio, and which we will have to comply with when we acquire loan portfolios in the future and assume the servicing obligations for the acquired loans. The extent of state regulation of our insurance business varies by product and by jurisdiction, but relates primarily to the following: licensing; conduct of business; periodic examination of the affairs of insurers; form and content of required financial reports; standards of solvency; limitations on dividend payments and other related party transactions; types of products offered; approval of policy forms and premium rates; permissible investments; deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders; reserve requirements for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes; and claims processing. All of our operations are subject to regular examination by state and federal regulators, and as a whole, our entities are subject to several hundred regulatory examinations in a given year. These examinations may result in requirements to change our policies or practices, and in some cases, we are required to pay monetary fines or make reimbursements to customers. Many state regulators and some federal regulators have indicated an intention to pool their resources in order to conduct examinations of licensed entities, including us, at the same time (referred to as a multi-state examination). This could result in more in-depth examinations, which could be more costly and lead to more significant enforcement actions. We believe that we maintain all material licenses and permits required for our current operations and are in substantial compliance with all applicable federal, state and local regulations, but we may not be able to maintain all requisite licenses and permits, and the failure to satisfy those and other regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, changes in laws or regulations applicable to us could subject us to additional licensing, registration and other regulatory requirements in the future or could adversely affect our ability to operate or the manner in which we conduct business. A material failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in regulatory actions, lawsuits and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 25Table of Contents For more information with respect to the regulatory framework affecting our businesses, see BusinessRegulation included in Item 1. The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act and the creation of the CFPB may significantly increase our regulatory costs and burdens. On July 21, 2010, the President of the United States signed the Dodd-Frank Act into law, which, among other things, provided for the creation of the CFPB. This law, and the regulations already promulgated and to be promulgated under it, are likely to affect our operations in terms of increased oversight of financial services products by the CFPB, and the imposition of restrictions on the allowable terms for certain consumer credit transactions. The CFPB has significant authority to implement and enforce federal consumer finance laws, including the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act and new requirements for financial services products provided for in the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the authority to identify and prohibit unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provides the CFPB with broad supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over various consumer financial products and services, including the ability to require reimbursements and other payments to customers for alleged legal violations, and to impose significant penalties, as well as injunctive relief that prohibits lenders from engaging in allegedly unlawful practices. In addition to the foregoing, the CFPB has the authority to obtain cease and desist orders providing for affirmative relief and/or monetary penalties. Further, state attorneys general and state regulators are authorized to bring civil actions to enforce certain consumer protection provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act and accompanying regulations are being phased in over time, and while some regulations have been promulgated, many others have not yet been proposed or finalized. We cannot predict the terms of all of the final regulations, their intended consequences or how such regulations will affect us or our industry. The CFPB currently has supervisory authority over our real estate servicing activities, and likely will have supervisory authority over our consumer lending business. It also has the authority to bring enforcement actions for violations of laws over which it has jurisdiction regardless of whether it has supervisory authority for a given product or service. The CFPB recently finalized mortgage servicing regulations that became effective in January 2014, which makes it more difficult and expensive to service mortgages. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act also gives the CFPB supervisory authority over entities that are designated as larger participants in certain financial services markets, including consumer installment loans and related products. The CFPB has not yet promulgated regulations that designate larger participants for consumer finance companies. If we are designated as a larger participant for this market, we also will be subject to supervision and examination by the CFPB with respect to our consumer loan business. We expect to be designated as a larger participant. The CFPBs broad supervisory and enforcement powers could affect our business and operations significantly in terms of increased operating and regulatory compliance costs, and limits on the types of products we offer and the manner in which they are offered, among other things. See BusinessRegulation. The CFPB and certain state regulators recently have brought enforcement actions against lenders for the sale of ancillary products, such as debt forgiveness products that forgive a borrowers debt if certain events occur (e.g., death or disability). Among other things, the regulators have questioned the cost of the product when compared to the benefits and whether the tactics used by the lender to sell the products mislead consumers. Although our insurance products are regulated by insurance regulators, sales of insurance could be challenged in a similar manner. In addition, we sell a few other ancillary products that are not considered to be insurance, and which could be subject to additional CFPB or state regulator scrutiny. 26Table of Contents We purchase and sell finance receivables, including charged off receivables and receivables where the borrower is in default. This practice could subject us to heightened regulatory scrutiny, which may expose us to legal action, cause us to incur losses and/or limit or impede our collection activity. As part of our business model, we purchase and sell finance receivables and plan to expand this practice in the future. Although the borrowers for some of these finance receivables are current on their payments, other borrowers may be in default (including in bankruptcy) or the debt may have been charged off as uncollectible. The CFPB and other regulators have recently significantly increased their scrutiny of the purchase and sale of debt, and collections practices undertaken by purchasers of debt, especially delinquent and charged off debt. The CFPB has criticized sellers of debt for not maintaining sufficient documentation to support and verify the validity or amount of the debt. It has also criticized debt collectors for, among other things, their collection tactics, attempting to collect debts that no longer are valid, misrepresenting the amount of the debt and not having sufficient documentation to verify the validity or amount of the debt. Our purchases or sales of receivables could expose us to lawsuits or fines by regulators if we do not have sufficient documentation to support and verify the validity and amount of the finance receivables underlying these transactions, or if we or purchasers of our finance receivables use collection methods that are viewed as unfair or abusive. In addition, our collections could suffer and we may incur additional expenses if we are required to change collection practices or stop collecting on certain debts as a result of a lawsuit or action on the part of regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act also may adversely affect the securitization market because it requires, among other things, that a securitizer generally retain not less than 5% of the credit risk for certain types of securitized assets that are transferred, sold, or conveyed through issuance of ABS. Moreover, the SEC has proposed significant changes to Regulation AB, which, if adopted in their present form, could result in sweeping changes to the commercial and residential mortgage loan securitization markets, as well as to the market for the re-securitization of mortgage-backed securities. The SEC also has proposed rules that would require issuers and underwriters to make any third-party due diligence reports on ABS publicly available. These changes could result in additional costs or limit our ability to securitize loans. For more information with respect to the regulatory framework affecting our businesses, see BusinessRegulation included in Item 1. Potential changes to the Investment Company Act could affect our method of doing business. The SEC recently solicited public comment on a wide range of issues relating to certain existing provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act), including the nature of real estate or real estate related assets that qualify for purposes of certain exemptions. There can be no assurance that the laws and regulations governing the Investment Company Act status of real estate or real estate related assets or SEC guidance regarding Investment Company Act exemptions for real estate assets will not change in a manner that adversely affects our operations. Real estate loan servicing and loan modifications have come under increasing scrutiny from government officials and others, which could make servicing our legacy real estate portfolio more costly and difficult. Real estate loan servicers have recently come under increasing scrutiny. In addition, some states and municipalities have passed laws that impose additional duties on foreclosing lenders and real estate loan servicers, such as mandatory mediation or extensive requirements for maintenance of vacant properties, which, in some cases, begin even before a lender has taken title to property. These additional requirements can delay foreclosures, make it uneconomical to foreclose on mortgaged real estate or result in significant additional costs, which could materially adversely affect the value of our portfolio. 27Table of Contents The CFPB recently finalized mortgage servicing regulations that became effective in January 2014, which makes it more difficult and expensive to service real estate loans. The U.S. Government has implemented a number of federal programs designed to assist homeowners, including the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), which provides homeowners with assistance in avoiding residential real estate loan foreclosures. In third quarter 2009, our subsidiary, MorEquity entered into a Commitment to Purchase Financial Instrument and Servicer Participation Agreement with the Federal National Mortgage Association as financial agent for the United States Department of the Treasury, which provides for participation in HAMP. On February 1, 2011, MorEquity entered into subservicing agreements for the servicing of its real estate loans with Nationstar Mortgage LLC (Nationstar). Loans subserviced by Nationstar and servicers for certain securitized loans that are eligible for modification pursuant to HAMP guidelines are subject to HAMP. We also have implemented proprietary real estate loan modification programs in order to help customers in our branch segment remain current on their loans and avoid foreclosure. HAMP, our proprietary loan modification programs and other existing or future legislative or regulatory actions, including possible amendments to the bankruptcy laws, which result in the modification of outstanding real estate loans, may adversely affect the value of, and the returns on, our existing portfolio and the assets we acquire in the future. RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS An inability to access adequate sources of liquidity may adversely affect our ability to fund operational requirements and satisfy financial obligations. Our ability to access capital and credit was significantly affected by the substantial disruption in the U.S. credit markets and the associated credit rating downgrades on our debt. In addition, the risk of volatility surrounding the global economic system and uncertainty surrounding regulatory reforms such as the Dodd-Frank Act continue to create uncertainty around access to the capital markets. Historically, we funded our operations and repaid our debt and other obligations using funds collected from our finance receivable portfolio and new debt issuances. Although market conditions have improved recently, for a number of years following the economic downturn and disruption in the credit markets, our traditional borrowing sources, including our ability to cost effectively issue large amounts of unsecured debt in the capital markets, particularly issuances of commercial paper, have generally not been available to us. Instead we have primarily raised capital through securitization transactions and, although there can be no assurances that we will be able to complete additional securitizations, we currently expect our near-term sources of capital markets funding to continue to derive from securitization transactions. If we are unable to complete additional securitization transactions on a timely basis or upon terms acceptable to us or otherwise access adequate sources of liquidity, our ability to fund our own operational requirements and satisfy financial obligations may be adversely affected. Our indebtedness is significant, which could affect our ability to meet our obligations under our debt instruments and could materially and adversely affect our business and ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry. We currently have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2013, we had $12.8 billion of indebtedness outstanding (including securitizations and secured indebtedness). Interest expense on our indebtedness was $919.7 million in 2013. There can be no assurance that we will be able to repay or refinance our debt in the future. 28Table of Contents The amount of indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following: ·                  it may require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of the principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, which reduces the funds available for other purposes, including finance receivable originations;·                  it could limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing regulatory, business and economic conditions;·                  it may limit our ability to incur additional borrowings or securitizations for working capital, capital expenditures, business development, debt service requirements, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes, or to refinance our indebtedness;·                  it may require us to seek to change the maturity, interest rate and other terms of our existing debt;·                  it may cause a further downgrade of our debt and long-term corporate ratings; and·                  it may cause us to be more vulnerable to periods of negative or slow growth in the general economy or in our business. In addition, meeting our anticipated liquidity requirements is contingent upon our continued compliance with our existing debt agreements. An event of default or declaration of acceleration under one of our existing debt agreements could also result in an event of default and declaration of acceleration under certain of our other existing debt agreements. Such an acceleration of our debt would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to continue as a going concern. Furthermore, our existing debt agreements do not restrict us from incurring significant additional indebtedness. If our debt obligations increase, whether due to the increased cost of existing indebtedness or the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the consequences described above could be magnified. Certain of our outstanding notes contain covenants that restrict our operations and may inhibit our ability to grow our business and increase revenues. Certain of SFCs indentures and notes contain a covenant that limits SFCs and its subsidiaries ability to create or incur liens. These restrictions do not generally apply to us or SFI and its subsidiaries.The restrictions may interfere with our ability to obtain new or additional financing or may affect the manner in which we structure such new or additional financing or engage in other business activities, which may significantly limit or harm our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. A default and resulting acceleration of obligations could also result in an event of default and declaration of acceleration under certain of our other existing debt agreements. Such an acceleration of our debt would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to continue as a going concern. A default could also significantly limit our alternatives to refinance both the debt under which the default occurred and other indebtedness. This limitation may significantly restrict our financing options during times of either market distress or our financial distress, which are precisely the times when having financing options is most important. 29Table of Contents The assessment of our liquidity is based upon significant judgments or estimates that could prove to be materially incorrect. In assessing our current financial position and developing operating plans for the future, management has made significant judgments and estimates with respect to our liquidity, including but not limited to: ·                  our ability to generate sufficient cash to service all of our outstanding debt;·                  our continued ability to access debt and securitization markets and other sources of funding on favorable terms;·                  our ability to complete on favorable terms, as needed, additional borrowings, securitizations, finance receivable portfolio sales, or other transactions to support liquidity, and the costs associated with these funding sources, including sales at less than carrying value and limits on the types of assets that can be securitized or sold, which would affect profitability;·                  the potential for downgrade of our debt by rating agencies, which would have a negative impact on our cost of, and access to, capital;·                  our ability to comply with our debt covenants;·                  the amount of cash expected to be received from our finance receivable portfolio through collections (including prepayments) and receipt of finance charges, which could be materially different than our estimates;·                  the potential for declining financial flexibility and reduced income should we use more of our assets for securitizations and finance receivable portfolio sales; and·                  the potential for reduced income due to the possible deterioration of the credit quality of our finance receivable portfolios. Additionally, there are numerous risks to our financial results, liquidity, and capital raising and debt refinancing plans that are not quantified in our current liquidity forecasts. These risks include, but are not limited, to the following: ·                  the liquidation and related losses within our real estate portfolio could be substantial and result in reduced cash receipts;·                  our inability to grow our personal loan portfolio with adequate profitability to fund operations, loan losses, and other expenses;·                  our inability to monetize assets including, but not limited to, our access to debt and securitization markets;·                  the effect of federal, state and local laws, regulations, or regulatory policies and practices, including the Dodd-Frank Act (which, among other things, established the CFPB with broad authority to regulate and examine financial institutions), on our ability to conduct business or the manner in which we conduct business, such as licensing requirements, pricing limitations or restrictions on the method of offering products, as well as changes that may result from increased regulatory scrutiny of the sub-prime lending industry;·                  the potential for increasing costs and difficulty in servicing our loan portfolio, especially our liquidating real estate loan portfolio (including costs and delays associated with foreclosure on real estate collateral), as a result of heightened nationwide regulatory scrutiny of loan servicing and foreclosure practices in the industry generally, and related costs that could be passed on to us in connection with the subservicing of our real estate loans that were originated or acquired centrally;·                  potential liability relating to real estate and personal loans which we have sold or may sell in the future, or relating to securitized loans, if it is determined that there was a non-curable breach of a warranty made in connection with the transaction;·                  the potential for additional unforeseen cash demands or accelerations of obligations; 30Table of Contents ·                  reduced income due to loan modifications where the borrowers interest rate is reduced, principal payments are deferred, or other concessions are made;·                  the potential for declines in bond and equity markets; and·                  the potential effect on us if the capital levels of our regulated and unregulated subsidiaries prove inadequate to support current business plans. We intend to repay indebtedness with one or more of the following activities, among others: finance receivable collections, cash on hand, additional debt financings (particularly new securitizations and possible new issuances and/or debt refinancing transactions), finance receivable portfolio sales, or a combination of the foregoing. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in undertaking any of these activities to support our operations and repay our obligations. However, the actual outcome of one or more of our plans could be materially different than expected or one or more of our significant judgments or estimates about the potential effects of these risks and uncertainties could prove to be materially incorrect. In the event of such an occurrence, if third-party financing is not available, our liquidity could be substantially and materially affected, and as a result, substantial doubt could exist about our ability to continue as a going concern. Current ratings could adversely affect our ability to raise capital in the debt markets at attractive rates, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Each of Standard & Poors Ratings Services (S&P), Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys), and Fitch, Inc. (Fitch) rates SFCs debt. SFCs long term corporate debt rating is currently rated B- with a positive outlook by S&P, B- with a stable outlook by Fitch and B3 with a stable outlook by Moodys. Currently, no other Springleaf entity has a corporate debt rating, though they may be rated in the future. Ratings reflect the rating agencies opinions of a companys financial strength, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet our obligations. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization. Each agencys rating should be evaluated independently of any other agencys rating. If SFCs current ratings continue in effect or our ratings are downgraded, it will likely increase the interest rate that we would have to pay to raise money in the capital markets, making it more expensive for us to borrow money and adversely impacting our access to capital. As a result, our ratings could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our securitizations may expose us to financing and other risks, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to access the securitization market in the future, which may require us to seek more costly financing. We have securitized, and may in the future securitize, certain of our finance receivables to generate cash to originate or purchase new finance receivables or pay our outstanding indebtedness. In each such transaction, we convey a pool of finance receivables to a special purpose entity (SPE), which, in turn, conveys the finance receivables to a trust (the issuing entity). Concurrently, the trust issued non-recourse notes or certificates pursuant to the terms of an indenture or pooling and servicing agreement, respectively, which then are transferred to the SPE in exchange for the finance receivables. The securities issued by the trust are secured by the pool of finance receivables. In exchange for the transfer of finance receivables to the issuing entity, we receive the cash proceeds from the sale of the trust securities, all residual interests, if any, in the cash flows from the finance receivables after payment of the trust securities, and a 100% beneficial interest in the issuing entity. As a result of the challenging credit and liquidity conditions, the value of the subordinated securities we retain in our securitizations might be reduced or, in some cases, eliminated. 31Table of Contents The more limited securitization markets since 2007 have impaired our ability to complete securitizations. Although we were able to complete a securitization during the third quarter of 2011, three during 2012 and ten during 2013, the securitization market remains constrained, and we can give no assurances that we will be able to complete additional securitizations. In addition, since the onset of the recent financial crisis, we have only completed six securitizations of personal loan receivables, and we may face challenges executing personal loan securitizations in the future. Rating agencies may also affect our ability to execute a securitization transaction, or increase the costs we expect to incur from executing securitization transactions, not only by deciding not to issue ratings for our securitization transactions, but also by altering the criteria and process they follow in issuing ratings. Rating agencies could alter their ratings processes or criteria after we have accumulated finance receivables for securitization in a manner that effectively reduces the value of those finance receivables by increasing our financing costs or otherwise requiring that we incur additional costs to comply with those processes and criteria. We have no ability to control or predict what actions the rating agencies may take. Further, other matters, such as (i) accounting standards applicable to securitization transactions and (ii) capital and leverage requirements applicable to banks and other regulated financial institutions holding residential mortgage- backed securities or other asset-backed securities, could result in decreased investor demand for securities issued through our securitization transactions, or increased competition from other institutions that undertake securitization transactions. In addition, compliance with certain regulatory requirements, including the Dodd-Frank Act and the Investment Company Act, may affect the type of securitizations that we are able to complete. If it is not possible or economical for us to securitize our finance receivables in the future, we would need to seek alternative financing to support our operations and to meet our existing debt obligations, which may be less efficient and more expensive than raising capital via securitizations and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. RISKS RELATED TO OUR ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE If the ownership of our common stock continues to be highly concentrated, it may prevent minority stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and may result in conflicts of interest. Immediately following the completion of the Initial Public Offering of our stock, the Initial Stockholder, which is primarily owned by a private equity fund managed by an affiliate of Fortress, owned approximately 75% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, the Initial Stockholder owned shares sufficient for the majority vote over all matters requiring a stockholder vote, including: the election of directors; mergers, consolidations and acquisitions; the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other decisions affecting our capital structure; the amendment of our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws; and our winding up and dissolution. This concentration of ownership may delay, deter or prevent acts that would be favored by our other stockholders. The interests of the Initial Stockholder may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of our other stockholders. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of us. Also, the Initial Stockholder may seek to cause us to take courses of action that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment in us, but which might involve risks to our other stockholders or adversely affect us or our other stockholders, including investors in this offering. As a result, the market price of our common stock could decline or stockholders might not receive a premium over the then-current market price of our common stock upon a change in control. In addition, this concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in a company with significant stockholders. 32Table of Contents We are a holding company with no operations and will rely on our operating subsidiaries to provide us with funds necessary to meet our financial obligations and to pay dividends. We are a holding company with no material direct operations. Our principal assets are the equity interests we directly or indirectly hold in our operating subsidiaries, which own our operating assets. As a result, we are dependent on loans, dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock. Our subsidiaries are legally distinct from us and may be prohibited or restricted from paying dividends or otherwise making funds available to us under certain conditions. For example, our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit their ability to pay dividends or make loans or advances to us, principally to protect policyholders, and certain of our debt agreements limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. If we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to, or our board may exercise its discretion not to, pay dividends. We do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We have no plans to pay regular dividends on our common stock, and we anticipate that a significant amount of any free cash flow generated from our operations will be utilized to redeem or prepay outstanding indebtedness, and accordingly would not be available for dividends. Any declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant. Until such time that we pay a dividend, our investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Certain provisions of a stockholders agreement with our Initial Stockholder (the Stockholders Agreement), our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws could hinder, delay or prevent a change in control of us, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Certain provisions of the Stockholders Agreement, our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors or Fortress. These provisions provide for: ·                  a classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms;·                  removal of directors only for cause and only with the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the voting interest of stockholders entitled to vote (provided, however, that for so long as Fortress and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least 30% of our issued and outstanding common stock (including Fortress proportionate interest in shares of our common stock held by the Initial Stockholder), directors may be removed with or without cause with the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting interest of stockholders entitled to vote);·                  provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws prevent stockholders from calling special meetings of our stockholders (provided, however, that for so long as Fortress and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least 20% of our issued and outstanding common stock (including Fortress proportionate interest in shares of our common stock held by the Initial Stockholder), any stockholders that collectively beneficially own at least 20% of our issued and outstanding common stock may call special meetings of our stockholders); 33Table of Contents ·                  advance notice requirements by stockholders with respect to director nominations and actions to be taken at annual meetings;·                  certain rights to Fortress and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees with respect to the designation of directors for nomination and election to our board of directors, including the ability to appoint a majority of the members of our board of directors, plus one director, for so long as Fortress and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees continue to beneficially own, directly or indirectly at least 30% of our issued and outstanding common stock (including Fortresss proportionate interest in shares of our common stock held by the Initial Stockholder);·                  no provision in our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws for cumulative voting in the election of directors, which means that the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock can elect all the directors standing for election;·                  our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws only permit action by our stockholders outside a meeting by unanimous written consent, provided, however, that for so long as Fortress and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least 20% of our issued and outstanding common stock (including Fortresss proportionate interest in shares of our common stock held by the Initial Stockholder), our stockholders may act without a meeting by written consent of a majority of our stockholders; and·                  under our restated certificate of incorporation, our board of directors has authority to cause the issuance of preferred stock from time to time in one or more series and to establish the terms, preferences and rights of any such series of preferred stock, all without approval of our stockholders. Nothing in our restated certificate of incorporation precludes future issuances without stockholder approval of the authorized but unissued shares of our common stock. In addition, these provisions may make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a tender offer, change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by Fortress, our management or our board of directors. Public stockholders who might desire to participate in these types of transactions may not have an opportunity to do so, even if the transaction is favorable to stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to benefit from a change in control or change our management and board of directors and, as a result, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the ability of public stockholders to realize any potential change of control premium. Certain of our stockholders have the right to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses as us. Fortress and AIG and their respective affiliates, including the Initial Stockholder, engage in other investments and business activities in addition to their ownership of us. Under our restated certificate of incorporation, Fortress and AIG and their respective affiliates, including the Initial Stockholder, have the right, and have no duty to abstain from exercising such right, to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses as us, do business with any of our clients, customers or vendors or employ or otherwise engage any of our officers, directors or employees. If Fortress and AIG and their respective affiliates, including the Initial Stockholder, or any of their officers, directors or employees acquire knowledge of a potential transaction that could be a corporate opportunity, they have no duty, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to offer such corporate opportunity to us, our stockholders or our affiliates. In the event that any of our directors and officers who is also a director, officer or employee of any of Fortress, AIG or their respective affiliates, including the Initial Stockholder, acquires knowledge of a corporate opportunity or is offered a corporate opportunity, provided that this knowledge was not acquired solely in such persons capacity as our director or officer and such person acts in good faith, then even if Fortress or AIG or their respective affiliates, including the Initial Stockholder, pursues or acquires 34Table of Contents the corporate opportunity or if Fortress or AIG or their respective affiliates, including the Initial Stockholder, do not present the corporate opportunity to us such person is deemed to have fully satisfied such persons fiduciary duties owed to us and is not liable to us. Licensing and insurance laws and regulations may delay or impede purchases of our common stock. Certain of the states in which we are licensed to originate loans and the state in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled (Indiana) have laws or regulations which require regulatory approval for the acquisition of control of regulated entities. In addition, the insurance laws and regulations in Indiana generally provide that no person may acquire control, directly or indirectly, of a domiciled insurer, unless the person has provided required information to, and the acquisition is approved or not disapproved by, the Indiana Department of Insurance. Under some state laws or regulations, there exists a presumption of control when an acquiring party acquires as little as 10% of the voting securities of a regulated entity or of a company which itself controls (directly or indirectly) a regulated entity (the threshold is 10% under Indianas insurance statutes). Therefore, any person acquiring 10% or more of our common stock may need the prior approval of some state insurance and/or licensing regulators, or a determination from such regulators that control has not been acquired, which could significantly delay or otherwise impede their ability to complete such purchase. RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK The market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our stockholders. The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. If the market price of our common stock declines significantly, public stockholders may be unable to resell their shares at or above their purchase price, if at all. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include: ·                  variations in our quarterly or annual operating results;·                  changes in our earnings estimates (if provided) or differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts;·                  the contents of published research reports about us or our industry or the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock after this offering;·                  additions to, or departures of, key management personnel;·                  any increased indebtedness we may incur in the future;·                  announcements by us or others and developments affecting us;·                  actions by institutional stockholders;·                  litigation and governmental investigations;·                  changes in market valuations of similar companies;·                  speculation or reports by the press or investment community with respect to us or our industry in general;·                  increases in market interest rates that may lead purchasers of our shares to demand a higher yield;·                  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments; and·                  general market, political and economic conditions, including any such conditions and local conditions in the markets in which our borrowers are located. 35Table of Contents These broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The stock market in general has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, including in recent months. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a companys securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources. Future offerings of debt or equity securities by us may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In the future, we may attempt to obtain financing or to further increase our capital resources by issuing additional shares of our common stock or offering debt or other equity securities, including commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior or subordinated notes, debt securities convertible into equity or shares of preferred stock. In particular, we intend to continue to seek opportunities to acquire consumer finance portfolios and/or businesses that engage in consumer finance loan servicing and/or consumer finance loan originations. Future acquisitions could require substantial additional capital in excess of cash from operations. We would expect to finance the capital required for acquisitions through a combination of additional issuances of equity, corporate indebtedness, asset-backed acquisition financing and/or cash from operations. Issuing additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities or securities convertible into equity may dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders at the time of such issuance or reduce the market price of our common stock or both. Upon liquidation, holders of debt securities and preferred shares, if issued, and lenders with respect to other borrowings would receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. Debt securities convertible into equity could be subject to adjustments in the conversion ratio pursuant to which certain events may increase the number of equity securities issuable upon conversion. Preferred shares, if issued, could have a preference with respect to liquidating distributions or a preference with respect to dividend payments that could limit our ability to pay dividends to the holders of our common stock. Our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our common stock bear the risk that our future offerings may reduce the market price of our common stock and dilute their stockholdings in us. The market price of our common stock could be negatively affected by sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets. Approximately 75% of our outstanding common stock is held by the Initial Stockholder and can be resold into the public markets in the future in accordance with the requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). We and our executive officers, directors and the Initial Stockholder (who hold in the aggregate approximately 78.9% of our outstanding common stock) agreed with the underwriters in connection with our Initial Public Offering that, subject to certain exceptions, for a period of 180 days after the date of our Initial Public Offering prospectus (i.e., October 15, 2013), we and they would not directly or indirectly offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase or otherwise dispose of any common stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for common stock, or in any manner transfer all or a portion of the economic consequences associated with the ownership of common stock, or cause a registration statement covering any common stock to be filed, without the prior written consent of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated. However, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated may waive these restrictions at its discretion. 36Table of Contents Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, the Initial Stockholder and certain of its affiliates and permitted third party transferees have the right, in certain circumstances, to require us to register their approximately 86,064,227 shares of our common stock under the Securities Act for sale into the public markets. Upon the effectiveness of such a registration statement, all shares covered by the registration statement will be freely transferable. The market price of our common stock may decline significantly when the restrictions on resale by our existing stockholders lapse. A decline in the price of our common stock might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional common stock or other equity securities. The future issuance of additional common stock in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions or otherwise will dilute all other stockholdings. We have an aggregate of 1,885,167,105 shares of common stock authorized but unissued. We may issue all of these shares of common stock without any action or approval by our stockholders, subject to certain exceptions. We also intend to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and may issue common stock in connection with these acquisitions. Any common stock issued in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions, the exercise of outstanding stock options or otherwise would dilute the percentage ownership held by the investors who purchase common stock. As a public company, we will incur additional costs and face increased demands on our management. As a newly public company with shares listed on the NYSE, we are required to comply with an extensive body of regulations, including certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), regulations of the SEC and requirements of the NYSE. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, as a result of becoming a public company, we have added independent directors and created additional board committees. In addition, we may incur additional costs associated with our public company reporting requirements and maintaining directors and officers liability insurance. We are currently continuing to evaluate and monitor developments with respect to these rules, which may impose additional costs on us and materially affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. As a U.S.-listed public company, we will be required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act by December 31, 2014. Section 404 will require that we complete an annual assessment of our internal control over financial reporting to enable management to report on the operating effectiveness of those controls. In addition, we will be required to have our independent registered public accounting firm provide an opinion regarding the operating effectiveness of our internal controls. However, in connection with our audit for the year ended December 31, 2013, we determined that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting related to the initial and subsequent accounting for certain complex non-routine transactions, most notably relating to the impact of the Fortress Acquisition and the SpringCastle Portfolio acquisition. Specifically, we did not have adequate resources with an appropriate level of accounting knowledge, experience and training commensurate with the complexity of such transactions. We have begun taking steps to remediate the material weakness identified above and plan to take additional actions to remediate the underlying cause of this material weakness. However, we cannot provide any assurance that these remediation efforts will be successful or that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective as a result of these efforts. 37Table of Contents We can make no assurance that our internal control over financial reporting will be operating effectively in the future. If we are not able to maintain or document effective internal control over financial reporting, our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to opine as to the operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the required dates. Matters affecting our internal controls over financial reporting may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis, or may cause us to restate previously issued financial information, and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions or investigations by the SEC, or violations of the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE) listing rules. There also could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of our financial statements also is likely to suffer if we or our independent registered public accounting firm reports a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. This could materially adversely affect us by, for example, leading to a decline in our share price and impairing our ability to raise capital. 38Table of Contents "
