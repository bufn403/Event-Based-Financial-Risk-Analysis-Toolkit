RISK FACTORS"" -->ITEM 1A.  RISK    FACTORS     (Cautionary Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation    Reform Act of 1995)     The disclosure and analysis in this Annual Report on    Form 10-K    contain some forward-looking statements that set forth    anticipated results based on managements plans and    assumptions. From time to time, we also provide forward-looking    statements in other written materials released to the public, as    well as oral forward-looking statements. Such statements give    the Companys current expectations or forecasts of future    events; they do not relate strictly to historical or current    facts. In particular, these include statements relating to    future actions, future performance or results of current and    anticipated sales efforts, expenses, and the outcome of    contingencies and other uncertainties, such as legal    proceedings, and financial results. Management tries, wherever    possible, to identify such statements by using words such as    anticipate, believe,    estimate, expect, intend,    plan, project and similar expressions.     Set forth below are factors that we think, individually or in    the aggregate, could cause the Companys actual results to    differ materially from past results or those anticipated,    estimated or projected. We note these factors for investors as    permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of    1995. Investors should understand that it is not possible to    predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, the    following should not be considered to be a complete list of all    potential risks or uncertainties. OneSource and other acquisitions may divert our focus and    lead to unexpected difficulties.  On    November 14, 2007, the Company acquired OneSource, which    effectively increased the Companys janitorial operations    by approximately 50% (when measured by revenues). Realization of    the benefits of the acquisition will depend, among other things,    upon our ability to integrate the businesses successfully and on    schedule and to achieve the anticipated savings associated with    reductions in offices, staffing and other costs. There can be no    assurance that the acquisition of OneSource or any acquisition    that we make in the future will provide the benefits that were    anticipated when entering the transaction. The process of    integrating an acquired business may create unforeseen    difficulties and expenses. The areas in which we may face risks    include:           Diversion of management time and focus from operating the    business to acquisition integration;           The need to integrate the acquired businesss accounting,    information technology, human resources and other administrative    systems to permit effective management and reduce expenses;           The need to implement or improve internal controls, procedures    and policies appropriate for a public company at a business that    prior to the acquisition lacked some of these controls,    procedures and policies;           Inability to maintain relationships with customers of the    acquired business;           Inability to retain employees, particularly sales and    operational personnel, of the acquired business;           Write-offs or impairment charges relating to goodwill and other    intangible assets from the acquisition; and           Unanticipated or unknown liabilities relating to the acquired    business.     In addition, pursuit of our announced strategy of international    growth will entail new risks associated with currency    fluctuations, international economic fluctuations, and language    and cultural differences. Our technology environment may be inadequate to support    growth.  Although we use centralized accounting    systems, we rely on a number of legacy information technology    systems, particularly our payroll systems, as well as manual    processes, to operate. These systems and processes may be unable    to provide adequate support for the business and create    excessive reliance upon manual rather than system controls. Use    of the legacy payroll systems could result, for instance, in    delays in meeting payroll obligations, in difficulty calculating    and tracking appropriate governmental withholding and other    payroll regulatory obligations, and in higher internal and    external expenses to work around these systems. Additionally,    the current technology environment is unable to support the    integration of acquired businesses and anticipated internal    growth. Effective October 2006, the Company entered into an    outsourcing agreement with International Business Machines    Corporation (IBM) to provide information technology    infrastructure and services. We are implementing a new payroll    and human resources information system, and upgrading the    accounting systems. The upgrade of the accounting systems    includes the consolidation of multiple databases, the potential    replacement of custom systems and business process redesign to    facilitate the implementation of shared-services functions    across the Company. In addition to the risk of potential failure    in    8Table of Contents    each project, supporting multiple concurrent projects may result    in resource constraints and the inability to complete projects    on schedule. The acquisition of OneSource will necessitate    integration and consolidation. We plan to continue to use the    OneSource information technology systems during a transition    period and are evaluating their integration with our systems.    IBM supports our current technology environment and assists us    in selecting new technology and upgrading current technology. It    is also assisting in the evaluation of the OneSource technology    environment. While we believe that IBMs experience and    expertise will lead to improvements in our technology    environment, the risks associated with outsourcing include the    dependence upon a third party for essential aspects of the    Companys business and risks to the security and integrity    of the Companys data in the hands of third parties. We may    also have potentially less control over costs associated with    necessary systems when they are supported by a third party, as    well as potentially less responsiveness from vendors than    employees. Transition to a Shared Services Center could create    disruption in functions affected.  The Company has    historically performed accounting functions, such as accounts    payable, accounts receivable collection and payroll, in a    decentralized manner through regional accounting centers in its    businesses. In 2007, we began consolidating these functions in a    Shared Services Center in Houston, Texas. The consolidation has    taken place in certain accounting functions for Janitorial and    over the next two years other functions and additional business    units (including OneSource) will be moved to the Shared Services    Center. The timing of the consolidation of different functions    is tied to the upgrade of the Companys accounting systems    and implementation of a new payroll system and human resources    information system. In addition to the risks associated with    technology changes, the Shared Services Center implementation    could lead to the turnover of personnel with critical knowledge,    which could impede our ability to bill customers and collect    receivables and might cause customer dissatisfaction associated    with an inability to respond to questions about billings and    other information until new employees can be retained and fully    trained. Because the consolidation of functions in the Shared    Services Center is tied to the upgrade of the Companys    accounting systems and implementation of a new payroll system    and human resources information system, delays in the    implementation of the technology changes would lead to delays in    the Companys ability to realize the benefits associated    with the Shared Services Center. The move of our corporate headquarters will lead to loss of    personnel and institutional knowledge, and may disrupt the    continuity of control functions.  In March 2007,    we announced the relocation of our corporate headquarters to New    York City beginning in 2008. This move will begin    January 1, 2008 and continue over the following two years.    In addition, certain functions that have operated centrally from    corporate headquarters, such as the finance and legal    organizations, will be dispersed in a combination of corporate    headquarters, field headquarters and shared service center    locations. These moves will increase employee turnover,    particularly in finance, legal and human resources. The loss of    personnel could lead to disruptions in control functions    stemming from delays in filling vacant positions and a lack of    personnel with institutional knowledge. A change in the frequency or severity of claims, a    deterioration in claims management, the cancellation or    non-renewal of primary insurance policies or a change in our    customers insurance needs could adversely affect    results.  Many customers, particularly    institutional owners and large property management companies,    prefer to do business with contractors, such as the Company,    with significant financial resources, who can provide    substantial insurance coverage. In fact, many of our clients    choose to obtain insurance coverage for the risks associated    with our services by being named as additional insureds under    our master liability insurance policies and by seeking    contractual indemnification for any damages associated with our    services. In addition, pursuant to our management and service    contracts, we charge certain clients an allocated portion of our    insurance-related costs, including workers compensation    insurance, at rates that, because of the scale of our operations    and claims experience, we believe are competitive. A material    change in insurance costs due to a change in the number of    claims, claims costs or premiums could have a material effect on    our operating income. In addition, should we be unable to renew    our umbrella and other commercial insurance policies at    competitive rates, it would have an adverse impact on the    Companys business, as would catastrophic uninsured claims    or the inability or refusal of our insurance carriers to pay    otherwise insured claims. Furthermore, where the Company    self-insures, a deterioration in claims management, whether by    the Company or by a third party claims administrator, could lead    to mismanagement of claims thereby increasing claim costs,    particularly in the workers compensation area. A change in estimated claims costs could affect    results.  We periodically evaluate estimated    claims    9Table of Contents    costs and liabilities to ensure that self-insurance reserves are    appropriate. Additionally, we monitor new claims and claims    development to assess the adequacy of insurance reserves. Trend    analysis is complex and highly subjective. The interpretation of    trends requires the knowledge of all factors affecting the    trends that may or may not be reflective of adverse developments    (e.g., changes in regulatory requirements and changes in    reserving methodology). If the trends suggest that the frequency    or severity of claims incurred has increased, we might be    required to record additional expenses for self-insurance    liabilities. In addition, variations in estimates that cause    changes in our insurance reserves may not always be related to    changes in claims experience. Changes in insurance reserves as a    result of a review can cause swings in operating results that    are unrelated to our ongoing business. In addition, because of    the time required for the analysis, we may not learn of a    deterioration in claims, particularly claims administered by a    third party, until additional costs have been incurred or are    projected. Because we base pricing in part on our estimated    insurance costs, our prices could be higher or lower than they    otherwise might be if better information were available    resulting in a competitive disadvantage in the former case and    reduced margins or unprofitable contracts in the latter. Debt to fund the acquisition of OneSource, as well as any    future increase in the level of debt or in interest rates, can    effect our results of operations.  Incurring debt    to acquire OneSource, and any future increase in the level of    debt, will require that a portion of cash flow from operating    activities be dedicated to interest payments and principal    payments at maturity. Unless the cash flows generated by    OneSource (or future acquisitions funded by debt) exceed the    required payments, debt service requirements could reduce our    ability to use our cash flow to fund operations and capital    expenditures, and to capitalize on future business opportunities    (including additional acquisitions). Because current interest    rates on our debt are variable, an increase in prevailing rates    would increase our interest costs. Further, our credit facility    agreement contains both financial covenants and covenants that    limit our ability to engage in specified transactions, which may    also constrain our flexibility. Our ability to operate and pay our debt obligations depends    upon our access to cash.  Because ABM conducts    business operations through operating subsidiaries, we depend on    those entities to generate the funds necessary to meet financial    obligations. Delays in collections or legal restrictions could    restrict ABMs subsidiaries ability to make    distributions or loans to ABM. The earnings from, or other    available assets of, these operating subsidiaries may not be    sufficient to make distributions to enable ABM to pay interest    on debt obligations when due or to pay the principal of such    debt at maturity. In addition, a substantial portion of our    investment portfolio is invested in auction rate securities and,    if an auction fails for securities in which we have invested,    the investment will not be liquid. In 2007, auctions for    $25.0 million of these securities failed and such failures    could occur in the future. In the event we need to access these    funds, we will not be able to do so until a future auction is    successful, the issuer redeems the outstanding securities or the    securities mature (between 20 and 50 years). If the issuer    of the securities is unable to successfully close future    auctions and its credit rating deteriorates, we may be required    to adjust the carrying value of the securities through an    impairment charge. Labor disputes could lead to loss of sales or expense    variations.  At November 30, 2007,    approximately 36% of the Companys employees were subject    to various local collective bargaining agreements, some of which    will expire or become subject to renegotiation during the year.    In addition, we are facing a number of union organizing drives.    When one or more of the Companys major collective    bargaining agreements becomes subject to renegotiation or when    we face union organizing drives, we and the union may disagree    on important issues which, in turn, could lead to a strike, work    slowdown or other job actions at one or more of our locations.    In a market where the Company and a number of major competitors    are unionized but other competitors are not unionized, we could    lose customers to competitors who are not unionized. A strike,    work slowdown or other job action could in some cases disrupt us    from providing services, resulting in reduced revenue. If    declines in customer service occur or if our customers are    targeted for sympathy strikes by other unionized workers,    contract cancellations could result. The result of negotiating a    first time agreement or renegotiating an existing collective    bargaining agreement could be a substantial increase in labor    and benefits expenses that we may be unable to pass through to    customers for some period of time, if at all.    10Table of ContentsA decline in commercial office building occupancy and rental    rates could affect sales and profitability.  Our    sales directly depend on commercial real estate occupancy    levels. Decreases in occupancy levels reduce demand and also    create pricing pressures on building maintenance and other    services provided by the Company. In certain geographic areas    and service segments, the Companys most profitable sales    are known as tag jobs, which are services performed for tenants    in buildings in which it performs building services for the    property owner or management company. A decline in occupancy    rates could result in a decline in fees paid by landlords, as    well as tenant work, which would lower sales and margins. In    addition, in those areas where the workers are unionized,    decreases in sales can be accompanied by relative increases in    labor costs if we are obligated by collective bargaining    agreements to retain workers with seniority and consequently    higher compensation levels and cannot pass through these costs    to customers. The financial difficulties or bankruptcy of one or more of    our major customers could adversely affect    results.  Future sales and our ability to collect    accounts receivable depend, in part, on the financial strength    of customers. We estimate an allowance for accounts we do not    consider collectible and this allowance adversely impacts    profitability. In the event customers experience financial    difficulty, and particularly if bankruptcy results,    profitability is further impacted by the Companys failure    to collect accounts receivable in excess of the estimated    allowance. Additionally, the Companys future sales would    be reduced by the loss of these customers. Acquisition activity could slow.  A significant    portion of our historic growth has come through acquisitions and    we expect to continue to acquire businesses in the future as    part of our growth strategy. A slowdown in acquisitions could    lead to a slower growth rate. Because new contracts frequently    involve    start-up    costs, sales associated with acquired operations generally have    higher margins than sales associated with internal growth.    Therefore, a slowdown in acquisition activity could lead to    constant or lower margins, as well as lower revenue growth. Our success depends on our ability to preserve our long-term    relationships with customers.  Our contracts with    our customers can generally be terminated upon relatively short    notice. However, the business associated with long-term    relationships is generally more profitable than that from    short-term relationships because we incur    start-up    costs with many new contracts, particularly for training,    operating equipment and uniforms. Once these costs are expensed    or fully depreciated over the appropriate periods, the    underlying contracts become more profitable. Therefore, our loss    of long-term customers could have an adverse impact on our    profitability even if we generate equivalent sales from new    customers. We are subject to intense competition that can constrain our    ability to gain business, as well as our    profitability.  We believe that each aspect of our    business is highly competitive, and that such competition is    based primarily on price and quality of service. We provide    nearly all our services under contracts originally obtained    through competitive bidding. The low cost of entry to the    facility services business has led to strongly competitive    markets consisting primarily of regional and local    owner-operated companies, with particularly intense competition    in the janitorial business in the Southeast and South Central    regions of the United States. We also compete with a few large,    diversified facility services and manufacturing companies on a    national basis. Indirectly, we compete with building owners and    tenants that can perform internally one or more of the services    that we provide. These building owners and tenants have a    competitive advantage in locations where the Companys    services are subject to sales tax and internal operations are    not. Furthermore, competitors may have lower costs because    privately owned companies operating in a limited geographic area    may have significantly lower labor and overhead costs. These    strong competitive pressures could impede our success in bidding    for profitable business and our ability to increase prices even    as costs rise, thereby reducing margins. Further, if sales    decline, we may not be able to reduce expenses correspondingly. An increase in costs that we cannot pass on to customers    could affect profitability.  We negotiate many    contracts under which our customers agree to pay certain costs    at rates set by the Company, particularly workers    compensation and other insurance coverage where the Company self    insures much of its risk. If actual costs exceed the rates we    set, then our profitability may decline unless we can negotiate    increases in these rates. In addition, if our costs,    particularly workers compensation and other insurance    costs, exceed those of our competitors, we may lose business    unless we establish rates that do not fully cover our costs. Natural disasters or acts of terrorism could disrupt    services.  Storms, earthquakes, drought, floods or    other natural disasters or acts of terrorism may result in    reduced sales or property damage. Disasters    11Table of Contents    may also cause economic dislocations throughout the country. In    addition, natural disasters or acts of terrorism may increase    the volatility of financial results, either due to increased    costs caused by the disaster with partial or no corresponding    compensation from customers, or, alternatively, increased sales    and profitability related to tag jobs, special projects and    other higher margin work necessitated by the disaster. In    addition, a significant portion of Parking sales is tied to the    numbers of airline passengers and hotel guests and Parking    results could be adversely affected if people curtail business    and personal travel as a result of any such event. We incur significant accounting and other control costs that    reduce profitability.  As a publicly traded    corporation, we incur certain costs to comply with regulatory    requirements. If regulatory requirements were to become more    stringent or if controls thought to be effective later fail, we    may be forced to make additional expenditures, the amounts of    which could be material. Most of our competitors are privately    owned so our accounting and control costs can be a competitive    disadvantage. Should sales decline or if we are unsuccessful at    increasing prices to cover higher expenditures for internal    controls and audits, the costs associated with regulatory    compliance will rise as a percentage of sales. Other issues and uncertainties may include:           Unanticipated adverse jury determinations, judicial rulings or    other developments in litigation to which we are subject;           New accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting policies;           Changes in U.S. immigration law that raise our    administrative costs;           Labor shortages that adversely affect our ability to employ    entry level personnel;           Legislation or other governmental action that detrimentally    impacts expenses or reduces sales by adversely affecting our    customers;           Low levels of capital investments by customers, which tend to be    cyclical in nature, could adversely impact the results of the    Lighting segment; and           The resignation, termination, death or disability of one or more    key executives that adversely affects customer retention or    day-to-day management.     We believe that the Company has the human and financial    resources for business success, but future profit and cash flow    can be adversely (or advantageously) influenced by a number of    factors, including those listed above, any and all of which are    inherently difficult to forecast. We undertake no obligation to    publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result    of new information, future events or otherwise"
