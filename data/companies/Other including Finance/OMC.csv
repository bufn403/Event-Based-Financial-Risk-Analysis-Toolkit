Economic RisksAdverse economic conditions, a reduction in client spending, a deterioration in the credit markets or a delay in client payments could have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.Macroeconomic conditions have a direct impact on our business, results of operations and financial position. Adverse economic conditions, including high and sustained inflation, rising interest rates, supply chain issues affecting the distribution of our clients’ products, or a disruption in the credit markets, pose a risk that clients may reduce, postpone or cancel spending on advertising, marketing and corporate communications projects. Such actions would reduce the demand for our services and could result in a reduction in our revenue, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position. A contraction or disruption in the credit markets may make it more difficult for us to meet our working capital requirements or refinance maturing debt, or negatively impact our clients’ liquidity that could cause them to delay payment or take other actions that would negatively affect our working capital. In such circumstances, we may need to obtain additional financing to fund our day-to-day working capital requirements, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. Even if we take action to respond to adverse economic conditions, reductions in revenue and disruptions in the credit markets by aligning our cost structure and more efficiently managing our working capital, such actions may not be effective.A period of sustained inflation across all the major markets in which we operate could result in higher operating costs. Our principal operating expenses are salary and service costs and occupancy and related costs. Inflationary pressures typically result in increases to our operating expenses. In cases of sustained inflation across several of our major markets, it may become increasingly difficult to effectively control increases to our costs. In addition, the effects of inflation on consumers budgets could result in the reduction of our clients’ spending plans on the advertising, marketing and communication services we provide. If we are unable to increase our fees or take other actions to mitigate the effect of the resulting higher costs, our business, results of operations and financial position could be negatively impacted.In an economic downturn, the risk of a material loss related to media purchases and production costs incurred on behalf of our clients could significantly increase, and methods for managing or mitigating such risk may be less available or unavailable.In the normal course of business, our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services. These commitments are included in accounts payable when the services are delivered by the media providers or production companies. If permitted by local law and the client agreement, many of our agencies purchase media and production services for our clients as an agent for a disclosed principal. In addition, while operating practices vary by country, media type and media vendor, in the United States and certain foreign markets, many of our agencies’ contracts with media and production providers specify that our agencies are not liable to the media and production providers under the theory of sequential liability until and to the extent we have been paid by our client for the media or production services.Where purchases of media and production services are made by our agencies as a principal or are not subject to the theory of sequential liability, the risk of a material loss as a result of payment default by our clients could increase significantly, and such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.While we use various methods to manage the risk of payment default, including obtaining credit insurance, requiring payment in advance, mitigating the potential loss in the marketplace or negotiating with media providers, these may be insufficient, less available, or unavailable during a severe economic downturn.Geopolitical events, international hostilities or acts of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.Current or future geopolitical events, international hostilities or acts of terrorism could impact global economies through, among other things, disruption of business operations and demand for client services, disruption in the credit markets, heightened risk of cybersecurity attacks and disruptions to our information technology infrastructure, increased energy costs and labor and supply chain disruptions. This could result in suspension of our, or our clients’ businesses in the affected region, which could impact client spending on our services. These actions could have a significant and adverse impact our business, results of operations and financial position in the future. For example, as a result of the war in Ukraine, in the first quarter of 2022, we suspended our business operations in Ukraine and disposed of all our businesses in Russia. In addition, economic sanctions were imposed on Russia by the United States, United Kingdom, and the European Union. The war in Ukraine is ongoing, and its duration is uncertain. We cannot predict the impact of the war in Ukraine or other international hostilities on our businesses and operations.4 Global public health crises or pandemics, such as the COVID -19 pandemic, or other similar health crises could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial position.When a public health crisis arises, demand for certain of our services may be adversely affected by government measures, including restrictions on travel and business operations and quarantine and stay-at-home orders arising from the occurrence of a pandemic, or similar global public health crises. The extent of the impact on our business will depend on numerous factors that we are not able to accurately predict, including the geographic regions that may be affected.Business and Operational RisksClients periodically review and change their advertising, marketing and corporate communications requirements and relationships. If we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients, our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected.We operate in a highly competitive industry. Key competitive considerations for retaining existing clients and winning new clients include our ability to develop solutions that meet client needs in a rapidly changing environment, the quality and effectiveness of our services and our ability to serve clients efficiently, particularly large multinational clients, on a broad geographic basis. From time to time, clients may put their advertising, marketing and corporate communications business up for competitive review. We have won and lost accounts as a result of these reviews. To the extent that we are not able to remain competitive or retain key clients, our revenue may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.Acquiring new clients and retaining existing clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships, retaining key personnel and maintaining a highly skilled workforce.Our ability to acquire new clients and retain existing clients may, in some cases, be limited by clients’ perceptions of, or policies concerning, conflicts of interest arising from our other client relationships. If we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests, our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected.As a service business, our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our ability to provide our services in the manner clients have come to expect may be adversely affected, which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.The loss of several of our largest clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.In 2023, our 100 largest clients represented approximately 55% of our revenue. Clients generally are able to reduce or cancel current or future spending on advertising, marketing and corporate communications projects at any time on short notice for any reason. A significant reduction in spending on our services by our largest clients, or the loss of several of our largest clients, if not replaced by new clients or an increase in business from existing clients, would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.We rely extensively on information technology systems, and cybersecurity incidents could adversely affect us.We rely on our own and third-party service providers’ information technology systems and infrastructure to connect with our clients, people and others, and to collect, store, transfer, process and use business, personal and financial data. We face cybersecurity risks that threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information technology systems or data stored on such systems. Additionally, hardware, software applications or services that we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our information technology systems or data stored on such systems.Cybersecurity threats and attacks, including computer viruses, advanced persistent threats, malware, hacking, ransomware or other destructive or disruptive activities or software, are constantly evolving and pose a risk to our information technology systems and data. There can be no assurance that our cybersecurity risk management program and processes will be fully implemented, complied with or effective in detecting and preventing such threats or protecting our information technology systems or data. Security breaches, improper use of our systems and unauthorized access to our data and information by employees and others may pose a risk that data may be exposed to unauthorized persons. Such occurrences could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and reputation and could result in litigation or regulatory action, as discussed below.In addition, we make extensive use of third-party service providers, including cloud providers, that store, transmit and process data. These third-party service providers are also subject to malicious attacks and cybersecurity threats that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation and could result in litigation or regulatory action, as discussed below.5 Currently, many of our agencies operate in a flexible working environment that allows for partial remote work. The number of personnel working remotely varies by market and is dependent on local conditions. When our employees work remotely, the risk of cybersecurity incidents and attacks and unauthorized exposure of sensitive business and client advertising and marketing information, as well as personal data or information, increases.We and certain of our third-party providers regularly experience cyberattacks and other incidents, and we expect such attacks and incidents to continue. For example, we have experienced cybersecurity incidents that resulted in the disruption of our information technology systems and required us to engage third parties to remediate the issues. While to date no incidents have had a material impact on our operations or financial results, we cannot guarantee that material incidents will not occur in the future. Any attack or incident could result in legal claims or proceedings (such as class actions), regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, fines and penalties, negative reputational impacts, and/or significant incident response, system restoration or remediation and future compliance costs, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We also cannot guarantee that any such costs or losses will be covered by our existing insurance policies or that applicable insurance will be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms or at all.We are subject to risks related to our use of generative AI, a new and emerging technology, which is in the early stages of commercial use.We continually evaluate the use of AI in our business processes, and in 2023 we entered into strategic partnerships with leading AI technology companies, enabling enhanced product and service capabilities in generative AI. In recent years, the use of AI has come under increased scrutiny. This technology, which is a new and emerging technology in early stages of commercial use, presents a number of risks inherent in its use, including ethical considerations, public perception and reputation concerns, intellectual property protection, regulatory compliance and privacy and data security concerns, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. Further, new laws, guidance and decisions in this area may limit our ability to use AI or decrease its usefulness. As a result, we cannot predict future developments in AI and related impacts to our business and our industry. If we are unable to successfully adapt to new developments related to, and risks and challenges associated with AI, our business, results of operations and financial position could be negatively impacted.Risks Related to International OperationsCurrency exchange rate fluctuations have impacted, and in the future could impact, our business, results of operations and financial position.In 2023, our international operations represented approximately 49% of our revenue. We operate in all major international markets including the Euro Zone, the United Kingdom, or the U.K., Australia, Brazil, Canada, China and Japan. Our agencies transact business in more than 50 different currencies. Substantially all of our foreign operations transact business in their local currency and, accordingly, their financial statements are translated into U.S. Dollars. As a result, both adverse and beneficial fluctuations in foreign exchange rates impact our business, results of operations and financial position. In addition, funds transferred to the United States can be adversely or beneficially impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.We operate in high-growth markets and developing countries, which often carry greater risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.The operational and financial performance of our international businesses are affected by global and regional economic conditions, competition for new business and personnel, currency exchange rate fluctuations, political conditions, differing tax and regulatory environments and other risks associated with extensive international operations. We conduct business in numerous high-growth markets and developing countries. Such countries tend to have longer billing collection cycles, currency repatriation restrictions and commercial laws that can be undeveloped, vague, inconsistently enforced, retroactively applied or frequently changed. Our operations are also subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are complex and stringent, and any changes and violations could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation. Our business, results of operations and financial position can be adversely affected if we are unable to effectively operate, or manage the risks associated with operating in these markets and countries. For financial information by geographic region, see Notes 3 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements.Risks Related to AcquisitionsWe may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions.We regularly evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses that are complementary to our businesses and client needs, and in some cases, associated technological capabilities and assets. As part of the process, we conduct business, legal and financial due diligence to identify and evaluate material risks involved in any particular transaction, including business strategy and operational execution. Despite our efforts, we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks. As a result, the intended advantages of any given acquisition may not be realized. If we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions, our business, results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.6 Our goodwill is an intangible asset that may become impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP or GAAP, we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill related to our acquisitions; a substantial portion of which represents the intangible specialized know-how of the acquired workforce. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually on May 1 and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows. While we have concluded, for each year presented in the financial statements included in this report, that our goodwill is not impaired, future events could cause us to conclude that the intangible asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired. Any resulting non-cash impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.Legal and Regulatory RisksLaws and regulations and actions of consumer advocates may limit the scope and content of our services, affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs, result in third-party claims, litigation, regulatory proceedings or government investigations, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.Government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope, content and manner of presentation of advertising, marketing and corporate communications services, through regulation or other governmental action, which could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs. Such regulation may seek, among other things, to limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenditures by certain industries or for certain products and services. In addition, there has been a tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices and claims, which could cause our clients affected by such actions to reduce their spending on our services, and from time to time we may be subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory proceedings or government investigations into whether our business practices comport with applicable law. Regardless of the merit of such claims, lawsuits, proceedings or investigations, defending against them could cost us a significant amount of time and money and result in negative publicity. Any regulatory or judicial action that affects our ability to meet our clients’ needs or reduces client spending on our services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.Compliance with ever evolving federal, state, and foreign laws relating to the handling of information about individuals involves significant expenditure and resources, and any failure by us or our vendors to comply could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.We, and third-party vendors on our behalf, process information related to individuals, including from and about individuals we may advertise to, actual and prospective clients, employees, and service providers. We and our vendors are subject to a variety of federal, state, and foreign laws, rules, regulations, industry standards, and other requirements related to privacy, use of personal information, marketing and advertising, and internet tracking technologies. These requirements, and their application, interpretation, and amendments are constantly evolving and developing. Among other things, such laws generally: require disclosures about the data collection, use, and disclosure practices of covered businesses, and provide individuals expanded rights to access, delete, and correct their personal information, and opt out of certain sales or transfers of personal information.Our obligations related to data privacy and security are quickly changing in an increasingly stringent fashion, creating some uncertainty as to the future legal framework governing such matters. Preparing for and complying with these obligations requires us to devote significant resources. These obligations may necessitate changes to our practices and to those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf. In addition, these laws, rules, and regulations could also affect the acceptance of new communications technologies and the use of current communications technologies as advertising media.Any failure or perceived failure by us, or third parties on which we depend, to comply with data privacy laws, rules, regulations, industry standards and other requirements could result in legal claims or proceedings (such as class actions), regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, fines and penalties, negative reputational impacts and future compliance costs, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We also cannot guarantee that any such costs or losses will be covered by our existing insurance policies or that applicable insurance will be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms or at all. Any of the foregoing could also affect our business and reduce demand for certain of our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.Expectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations expose us to potential liabilities, reputational harm and other unforeseen adverse effects on our business.Many governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are focused on environmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human capital and diversity, equity and inclusion. We make statements about our environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives through 7 information provided on our website, press statements and other communications, including through our Corporate Responsibility Report. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties and requires ongoing investments. The success of our goals and initiatives may be impacted by factors that are outside our control. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with our goals and initiatives and the focus and views of stakeholders may change and evolve over time and vary depending on the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to achieve our goals, further our initiatives, adhere to our public statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and views could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and stock price"

Economic RisksAdverse economic conditions, a reduction in client spending, a deterioration in the credit markets or a delay in client payments could have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.Macroeconomic conditions have a direct impact on our business, results of operations and financial position. Adverse economic conditions, including high and sustained inflation, rising interest rates, supply chain issues affecting the distribution of our clients’ products, or a disruption in the credit markets, pose a risk that clients may reduce, postpone or cancel spending on advertising, marketing and corporate communications projects. Such actions would reduce the demand for our services and could result in a reduction in our revenue, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position. A contraction in the availability of credit may make it more difficult for us to meet our working capital requirements. In addition, a disruption in the credit markets could adversely affect our clients liquidity and could cause them to delay payment for our services or take other actions that would negatively affect our working capital. In such circumstances, we may need to obtain additional financing to fund our day-to-day working capital requirements, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. Even if we take action to respond to adverse economic conditions, reductions in revenue and disruptions in the credit markets by aligning our cost structure and more efficiently managing our working capital, such actions may not be effective.A period of sustained inflation across all the major markets in which we operate could result in higher operating costs.

During the first quarter of 2022, the war in Ukraine required us to suspend our business operations in Ukraine, and we disposed of all of our businesses in Russia.The war in Ukraine is ongoing and its duration is uncertain. We cannot predict the outcome of the war in Ukraine or its impact on the broader region, as the conflict and related government actions are evolving and are beyond our control. The extent and duration of the military action, sanctions and resulting market disruptions, which may include increased energy costs and further supply chain disruptions, could be significant and could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial position in the future. Our clients’ businesses, results of operations and financial position could also be adversely impacted by the war in Ukraine, which could impact client spending on our services.4The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted our business, results of operations and financial position, and the COVID-19 pandemic or other similar public health crises could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial position in the future.The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted our business, results of operations and financial position beginning in 2020 and continuing through the first quarter of 2021. Global economic conditions may continue to be uncertain as long as the COVID-19 pandemic, or other similar public health crises, including the emergence of new COVID-19 variants, remain or become a public health threat. Demand for certain of our services may be adversely affected by government measures, including restrictions on travel and business operation and quarantine and stay-at-home orders arising from a recurrence of a pandemic, or similar public health crises. The extent of the impact on our business will depend on numerous factors that we are not able to accurately predict, including the geographic regions that may be affected.Business and Operational RisksClients periodically review and change their advertising, marketing and corporate communications requirements and relationships. If we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients, our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected.We operate in a highly competitive industry. Key competitive considerations for retaining existing clients and winning new clients include our ability to develop solutions that meet client needs in a rapidly changing environment, the quality and effectiveness of our services and our ability to serve clients efficiently, particularly large multinational clients, on a broad geographic basis. From time to time, clients may put their advertising, marketing and corporate communications business up for competitive review. We have won and lost accounts as a result of these reviews. To the extent that we are not able to remain competitive or retain key clients, our revenue may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.Acquiring new clients and retaining existing clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships, retaining key personnel and maintaining a highly skilled workforce.Our ability to acquire new clients and retain existing clients may, in some cases, be limited by clients’ perceptions of, or policies concerning, conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships. If we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests, our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected.As a service business, our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our ability to provide our services in the manner clients have come to expect may be adversely affected, which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.The loss of several of our largest clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.In 2022, our 100 largest clients represented approximately 53% of our revenue.

Increased cybersecurity threats and attacks, including computer viruses, hacking and ransomware attacks, are constantly evolving and pose a risk to our systems and networks. Security breaches, improper use of our systems and unauthorized access to our data and information by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. We also have access to sensitive or personal data or information that is subject to privacy laws and regulations. Our systems and processes may be unable to prevent material security breaches, and such breaches could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and reputation.Our third-party service providers, including cloud providers, store, transmit and process data. These third-party service providers are also subject to malicious attacks and cybersecurity threats that could adversely affect us.In addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic many of our employees worked from home for all or part of the time. Currently, many agencies continue to operate on a hybrid work schedule where employees are working from home part of the time. The number of employees working from home varies by market and is dependent on local conditions. The increase in the number of employees working from home may increase certain business and process control risks, including increased risk of cybersecurity 5incidents and exposure of sensitive business and client advertising and marketing information, as well as personal data or information.Risks Related to International OperationsCurrency exchange rate fluctuations have impacted, and in the future could impact, our business, results of operations and financial position.In 2022, our international operations represented approximately 48% of our revenue.

Any regulatory or judicial action that affects our 6ability to meet our clients' needs or reduces client spending on our services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.Laws and regulations related to user privacy, use of personal information and Internet tracking technologies have been proposed or enacted in the United States and a number of international markets. These laws and regulations could affect the acceptance of new communications technologies and the use of current communications technologies as advertising media. These actions could affect our business and reduce demand for certain of our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.Expectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations expose us to potential liabilities, reputational harm and other unforeseen adverse effects on our business.Many governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human capital and diversity, equity and inclusion. We make statements about our environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives through information provided on our website, press statements and other communications, including through our Corporate Responsibility Report. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties and requires ongoing investments. The success of our goals and initiatives may be impacted by factors that are outside our control. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with our goals and initiatives and the focus and views of stakeholders may change and evolve over time and vary depending on the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to achieve our goals, further our initiatives, adhere to our public statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and views could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and stock price"

Economic RisksAdverse economic conditions, a reduction in client spending, a deterioration in the credit markets or a delay in client payments could have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.Economic conditions have a direct impact on our business, results of operations and financial position. Adverse economic conditions, including those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, severe and sustained inflation in countries that comprise our major markets, supply chain issues affecting the distribution of our clients’ products, or a disruption in the credit markets, pose a risk that clients may reduce, postpone or cancel spending on advertising, marketing and corporate communications projects. Such actions would reduce the demand for our services and could result in a reduction in our revenue, which would adversely affect our 3business, results of operations and financial position. A contraction in the availability of credit may make it more difficult for us to meet our working capital requirements. In addition, a disruption in the credit markets could adversely affect our clients liquidity and could cause them to delay payment for our services or take other actions that would negatively affect our working capital. In such circumstances, we may need to obtain additional financing to fund our day-to-day working capital requirements, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. Even if we take action to respond to adverse economic conditions, reductions in revenue and disruptions in the credit markets by aligning our cost structure and more efficiently managing our working capital, such actions may not be effective.In an economic downturn, the risk of a material loss related to media purchases and production costs incurred on behalf of our clients could significantly increase, and methods for managing or mitigating such risk may be less available or unavailable.In the normal course of business, our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services. These commitments are included in accounts payable when the services are delivered by the media providers or production companies. If permitted by local law and the client agreement, many of our agencies purchase media and production services for our clients as an agent for a disclosed principal. In addition, while operating practices vary by country, media type and media vendor, in the United States and certain foreign markets, many of our agencies’ contracts with media and production providers specify that our agencies are not liable to the media and production providers under the theory of sequential liability until and to the extent we have been paid by our client for the media or production services.Where purchases of media and production services are made by our agencies as a principal or are not subject to the theory of sequential liability, the risk of a material loss as a result of payment default by our clients could increase significantly and such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.In addition, our methods of managing the risk of payment default, including obtaining credit insurance, requiring payment in advance, mitigating the potential loss in the marketplace or negotiating with media providers, may be insufficient, less available, or unavailable during a severe economic downturn.The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted our business, results of operations and financial position, and the COVID-19 pandemic or other similar public health crises could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial position in the future.The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted our business, results of operations and financial position in 2020 and through the first quarter of 2021, as most of our clients’ businesses were affected by the pandemic. As long as the COVID-19 pandemic, including any existing or new variants, remains a public health threat, global economic conditions will continue to be volatile and such uncertainty cuts across all clients, industries and geographies. Demand for certain of our service offerings may be adversely affected by new developments in the pandemic, including the emergence of new variants, or other similar public health crises. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, or other similar public health crises, on our business will depend on numerous factors that we are not able to accurately predict.Business and Operational RisksClients periodically review and change their advertising, marketing and corporate communications requirements and relationships. If we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients, our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected.We operate in a highly competitive industry. Key competitive considerations for retaining existing clients and winning new clients include our ability to develop solutions that meet client needs in a rapidly changing environment, the quality and effectiveness of our services and our ability to serve clients efficiently, particularly large multinational clients, on a broad geographic basis. While many of our client relationships are long-standing, from time to time clients put their advertising, marketing and corporate communications business up for competitive review. We have won and lost accounts as a result of these reviews. To the extent that we are not able to remain competitive or retain key clients, our revenue may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.Acquiring new clients and retaining existing clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships, retaining key personnel and maintaining a highly skilled workforce.Our ability to acquire new clients and retain existing clients may, in some cases, be limited by clients’ perceptions of, or policies concerning, conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships. If we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests, our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected.As a service business, our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our ability to provide our services in the manner clients have come to expect may be 4adversely affected, which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.The loss of several of our largest clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.In 2021, our 100 largest clients represented approximately 54% of our revenue. Clients generally are able to reduce or cancel current or future spending on advertising, marketing and corporate communications projects at any time on short notice for any reason. A significant reduction in spending on our services by our largest clients, or the loss of several of our largest clients, if not replaced by new clients or an increase in business from existing clients, would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.We rely extensively on information technology systems, and cybersecurity incidents could adversely affect us.We rely on information technology systems and infrastructure to connect with our clients, people and others and store business and financial data. Increased cybersecurity threats and attacks, which are constantly evolving, pose a risk to our systems and networks. For example, in February 2021, we experienced a cybersecurity incident that resulted in the disruption of certain of our information technology systems at one of our networks. Based on our investigation, the incident did not have a material impact on our business, results of operations or financial position. However, cybersecurity threats and attacks in the future could be material. Security breaches, improper use of our systems and unauthorized access to our data and information by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. We also have access to sensitive or personal data or information that is subject to privacy laws and regulations. Our systems and processes may be unable to prevent future material security breaches, and such breaches could adversely affect our business and reputation.We also use third-party service providers, including cloud providers, to store, transmit and process data. These third-party service providers could also be subject to cybersecurity incidents that could adversely affect us.In addition, through 2021, the overwhelming majority of our workforce temporarily transitioned to working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in the number of our employees working from home may increase certain business and procedural control risks, including increased risk of cybersecurity incidents and exposure of sensitive business and client advertising and marketing information, as well as personal data or information.Risks Related to International OperationsCurrency exchange rate fluctuations have impacted, and in the future could impact, our business, results of operations and financial position.In 2021, our international operations represented approximately 49% of our revenue. We operate in all major international markets including the Euro Zone, the United Kingdom, or the U.K., Australia, Brazil, Canada, China and Japan. Our agencies transact business in more than 50 different currencies. Substantially all of our foreign operations transact business in their local currency and, accordingly, their financial statements are translated into U.S. Dollars. As a result, both adverse and beneficial fluctuations in foreign exchange rates impact our business, results of operations and financial position. In addition, funds transferred to the United States can be adversely or beneficially impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.As a global business we face certain risks of doing business internationally, and we are exposed to risks from operating in high-growth markets and developing countries, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.The operational and financial performance of our international businesses are affected by global and regional economic conditions, competition for new business and staff, currency exchange rate fluctuations, political conditions, differing tax and regulatory environments and other risks associated with extensive international operations. In addition, we conduct business in numerous high-growth markets and developing countries that tend to have longer billing collection cycles, currency repatriation restrictions and commercial laws that can be undeveloped, vague, inconsistently enforced, retroactively applied or frequently changed. The risks associated with our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. Additionally, our operations are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are complex and stringent, and any changes and violations could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation. For financial information by geographic region, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.We have substantial operations in the U.K. and the Euro Zone. In 2020, the U.K. completed its separation from the European Union, or E.U., (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) and entered into an agreement, or Brexit Agreement, with the E.U. that defines the terms of their relationship, covering, among other things, trade and tariffs, services and travel. The uncertainties related to the impact of the Brexit Agreement have cross-border operational, financial and tax implications, among others, and any economic volatility that may arise in the U.K., the E.U. or elsewhere may adversely affect our business.5Risks Related to AcquisitionsWe may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions.We regularly evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses that are complementary to our businesses and client needs. As part of the process, we conduct business, legal and financial due diligence to identify and evaluate material risks involved in any particular transaction. Despite our efforts, we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks. As a result, the intended advantages of any given acquisition may not be realized. If we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions, our business, results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.Our goodwill is an intangible asset that may become impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP or GAAP, we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill related to our acquisitions; a substantial portion of which represents the intangible specialized know-how of the acquired workforce. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually at June 30 and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows. While we have concluded, for each year presented in the financial statements included in this report, that our goodwill is not impaired, future events could cause us to conclude that the intangible asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired. Any resulting non-cash impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.Regulatory RisksGovernment regulation and consumer advocates may limit the scope and content of our services, which could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.Government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope, content and manner of presentation of advertising, marketing and corporate communications services, through regulation or other governmental action, which could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs. Such regulation may seek, among other things, to limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenditures by certain industries or for certain products and services. In addition, there has been a tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices and claims, which could cause our clients affected by such actions to reduce their spending on our services. Any regulatory or judicial action that affects our ability to meet our clients' needs or reduces client spending on our services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.Further, laws and regulations related to user privacy, use of personal information and Internet tracking technologies have been proposed or enacted in the United States and a number of international markets. These laws and regulations could affect the acceptance of new communications technologies and the use of current communications technologies as advertising media. These actions could affect our business and reduce demand for certain of our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.We could be affected by future laws or regulations enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions.Our businesses could be indirectly affected by increased prices for goods or services provided to us by companies that are directly affected by laws and regulations aimed at mitigating the impact of climate change. Specifically, these companies may seek to pass their increased costs through to their customers. If our clients are impacted by such laws or regulations, either directly or indirectly, their spending for advertising and marketing services may decline, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial position. Additionally, to comply with potential future changes in environmental laws and regulations, we may need to incur additional costs, which could impact our business, results of operations and financial position"

Economic RisksThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our business, results of operations and financial position and could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial position in the future.In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted our business, results of operations and financial position. Most of our clients' businesses were negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As long as the COVID-19 pandemic remains a threat, global economic conditions will continue to be volatile and such uncertainty cuts across all clients, industries and geographies. Demand for our services can be expected to continue to be adversely affected as marketers reduce expenditures in the short term due to the uncertain impact of the pandemic on the global economy. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business will depend on numerous factors that we are not able to accurately predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, government actions to mitigate the effects of the pandemic, and the intermediate and long-term impact of the pandemic on marketers' spending plans.Adverse economic conditions, a reduction in client spending, a deterioration in the credit markets or a delay in client payments could have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.Economic conditions have a direct impact on our business, results of operations and financial position. Adverse global or regional economic conditions, including those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, pose a risk that clients may reduce, postpone or cancel spending on advertising, marketing and corporate communications projects. Such actions would reduce the demand for our services and could result in a reduction in our revenue, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and 3financial position. A contraction in the availability of credit may make it more difficult for us to meet our working capital requirements. In addition, a disruption in the credit markets could adversely affect our clients and could cause them to delay payment for our services or take other actions that would negatively affect our working capital. In such circumstances, we may need to obtain additional financing to fund our day-to-day working capital requirements, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. Even if we take action to respond to adverse economic conditions, reductions in revenue and disruptions in the credit markets by aligning our cost structure and more efficiently managing our working capital, such actions may not be effective.In an economic downturn, the risk of a material loss related to media purchases and production costs incurred on behalf of our clients could significantly increase, and methods for managing or mitigating such risk may be less available or unavailable.In the normal course of business, our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services.

Increased cybersecurity threats and attacks, which are constantly evolving, pose a risk to our systems and networks. For example, in February 2021, we experienced a cybersecurity incident that resulted in the disruption of certain of our information technology systems at one of our networks. Based on the information currently known and our investigation to date, we do not believe the incident will have a material impact on our business, operations or financial results. However, cybersecurity threats and attacks in the future could be material. Security breaches, improper use of our systems and unauthorized access to our data and information by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. We also have access to sensitive or personal data or information that is subject to privacy laws and regulations. Our systems and processes to protect against, detect, prevent, respond to and mitigate cybersecurity incidents and our organizational training for employees to develop an understanding of cybersecurity risks and threats may be unable to prevent material security breaches, theft, modification or loss of data, employee malfeasance and additional known and unknown threats. Such events could adversely affect our business and reputation. We also use third-party service providers, including cloud providers, to store, transmit and process data. These third-party service providers could also be subject to cybersecurity incidents that could adversely affect us.In addition, in 2020 and continuing into 2021, the overwhelming majority of our workforce temporarily transitioned to working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in the number of our employees working from home may increase certain business and procedural control risks, including increased risk of cybersecurity incidents and exposure of sensitive business and client advertising and marketing information as well as personal data or information.Risks Related to International OperationsCurrency exchange rate fluctuations have impacted, and in the future could impact our business, results of operations and financial position.In 2020, our international operations represented approximately 45% of our revenue.

Additionally, our operations are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are complex and stringent, and any violation could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation. For financial information by geographic region, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.We have substantial operations in the U.K. and the Euro Zone. On January 31, 2020, the U.K. withdrew from the European Union, or E.U. (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). Following its withdrawal, the U.K. will enter  negotiations with the E.U. regarding trade and other relationships during a transition period until December 31, 2020. The uncertainties related to the effects of Brexit have cross-border operational, financial and tax implications, among others, and any economic volatility that may arise in the U.K., the E.U. or elsewhere may adversely affect our business.We may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions.We regularly evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses that are complementary to our businesses and client needs. As part of the process, we conduct business, legal and financial due diligence to identify and evaluate material risks involved in any particular transaction. Despite our efforts, we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks. As a result, the intended advantages of any given acquisition may not be realized. If we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions, our business, results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.Our goodwill is an intangible asset that may become impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP or GAAP, we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill related to our acquisitions; a substantial portion of which represents the intangible specialized know-how of the acquired workforce. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually at June 30 and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows. While we have concluded, for each year presented in the financial statements included in this report, that our goodwill is not impaired, future events could cause us to conclude that the intangible asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired. Any resulting non-cash impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.We could be affected by future laws or regulations enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions.Generally, our businesses are not directly affected by current laws and other regulations aimed at mitigating the impact of climate change by reducing emissions or otherwise, although our businesses could be in the future. However, we could be indirectly affected by increased prices for goods or services provided to us by companies that are directly affected by these laws and regulations and pass their increased costs through to their customers. Further, if our clients are impacted by such laws or requirements, either directly or indirectly, their spending for advertising and marketing services may decline, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial position. Additionally, to comply with potential future changes in environmental laws and regulations, we may need to incur additional costs; therefore, at this time, we cannot estimate what impact such regulations may have on our business, results of operations and financial position"

Adverse economic conditions, a reduction in client spending, a deterioration in the credit markets or a delay in client payments could have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.Economic conditions have a direct impact on our business, results of operations and financial position. Adverse global or regional economic conditions pose a risk that clients may reduce, postpone or cancel spending on advertising, marketing and corporate communications projects. Such actions would reduce the demand for our services and could result in a reduction in our revenue, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position. A contraction in the availability of credit may make it more difficult for us to meet our working capital requirements. In addition, a disruption in the credit markets could adversely affect our clients and could cause them to delay payment for our services or take other actions that would negatively affect our working capital. In such circumstances, we may need to obtain additional financing to fund our day-to-day working capital requirements, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. Even if we take action to respond to adverse economic conditions, reductions in revenue and disruptions in the credit markets by aligning our cost structure and more efficiently managing our working capital, such actions may not be effective. In an economic downturn, the risk of a material loss related to media purchases and production costs incurred on behalf of our clients could significantly increase and methods for managing or mitigating such risk may be less available or unavailable.In the normal course of business, our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services. These commitments are included in accounts payable when the services are delivered by the media providers or production companies. If permitted by local law and the client agreement, many of our agencies purchase media and production services for our clients as an agent for a disclosed principal. In addition, while operating practices vary by country, media type and media vendor, in the United States and certain foreign markets, many of our agencies’ contracts with media and production providers specify that our agencies are not liable to the media and production providers under the theory of sequential liability until and to the extent we have been paid by our client for the media or production services.Where purchases of media and production services are made by our agencies as a principal or are not subject to the theory of sequential liability, the risk of a material loss as a result of payment default by our clients could increase significantly and such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.In addition, our methods of managing the risk of payment default, including obtaining credit insurance, requiring payment in advance, mitigating the potential loss in the marketplace or negotiating with media providers, may be less available or unavailable during a severe economic downturn.Clients periodically review and change their advertising, marketing and corporate communications requirements and relationships. If we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients, our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected.We operate in a highly competitive industry. Key competitive considerations for retaining existing clients and winning new clients include our ability to develop solutions that meet client needs in a rapidly changing environment, the quality and effectiveness of our services and our ability to serve clients efficiently, particularly large multinational clients, on a broad geographic basis. While many of our client relationships are long-standing, from time to time clients put their advertising, marketing and corporate communications business up for competitive review. We have won and lost accounts as a result of these reviews. To the extent that we are not able to remain competitive or retain key clients, our revenue may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.3The loss of several of our largest clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.Our 100 largest clients represent approximately 51% of our revenue. Clients generally are able to reduce or cancel current or future spending on advertising, marketing and corporate communications projects at any time on short notice for any reason. A significant reduction in spending on our services by our largest clients, or the loss of several of our largest clients, if not replaced by new clients or an increase in business from existing clients, would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.Acquiring new clients and retaining existing clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships, retaining key personnel and maintaining a highly skilled workforce.Our ability to acquire new clients and retain existing clients may, in some cases, be limited by clients’ perceptions of, or policies concerning, conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships. If we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests, our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected.Our employees are our most important assets and our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our ability to provide our services in the manner clients have come to expect may be adversely affected, which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.Currency exchange rate fluctuations could impact our business, results of operations and financial position.Our international operations represent approximately 48% of our 2018 revenue. We operate in all major international markets including the Euro Zone, the United Kingdom, or the U.K., Australia, Brazil, Canada, China and Japan. Our agencies transact business in more than 50 different currencies. Substantially all of our foreign operations transact business in their local currency and accordingly, their financial statements are translated into U.S. Dollars. As a result, both adverse and beneficial fluctuations in foreign exchange rates impact our business, results of operations and financial position. In addition, funds transferred to the United States can be adversely or beneficially impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.We rely extensively on information technology systems and cybersecurity incidents could adversely affect us.We rely on information technology systems and infrastructure to process, store and transmit data, summarize results, manage our business and maintain client advertising and marketing information. Increased cybersecurity threats and attacks, which are becoming more sophisticated, pose a risk to our systems and networks. Security breaches, improper use of our systems and unauthorized access to our data and information by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. We also have access to sensitive or personal data or information that is subject to privacy laws and regulations. Our systems and processes to protect against, detect, prevent, respond to and mitigate cybersecurity incidents and our organizational training for employees to develop an understanding of cybersecurity risks and threats may be unable to prevent material security breaches, theft, modification or loss of data, employee malfeasance and additional known and unknown threats. Such events could adversely affect our business and reputation. In addition, we use third-party service providers, including cloud providers, to store, transmit and process data. Our insurance may not protect us against damages resulting from cybersecurity incidents, which could adversely affect our business and reputation.Government regulation and consumer advocates may limit the scope and content of our services, which could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.Government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope, content and manner of presentation of advertising, marketing and corporate communications services, through regulation or other governmental action, which could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs. Such regulation may seek, among other things, to limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenditures by certain industries or for certain products and services. In addition, there has been a tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices and claims, which could cause our clients affected by such actions to reduce their spending on our services. Any regulatory or judicial action that affects our ability to meet our clients' needs or reduces client spending on our services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.4Further, laws and regulations, related to user privacy, use of personal information and Internet tracking technologies have been proposed or enacted in the United States and a number of international markets. These laws and regulations could affect the acceptance of new communications technologies and the use of current communications technologies as advertising mediums. These actions could affect our business and reduce demand for certain of our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.As a global business we face certain risks of doing business internationally and we are exposed to risks from operating in high-growth markets and developing countries, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.The operational and financial performance of our international businesses are affected by global and regional economic conditions, competition for new business and staff, currency exchange rate fluctuation, political conditions, regulatory environment and other risks associated with extensive international operations. In addition, we conduct business in numerous high-growth markets and developing countries which tend to have longer billing collection cycles, currency repatriation restrictions and commercial laws that can be undeveloped, vague, inconsistently enforced, retroactively applied or frequently changed.

In June 2016, voters in the U.K. elected to withdraw from the European Union, or E.U. (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). Unless the E.U. agrees to an extension, the U.K. is scheduled to exit the E.U. on March, 29, 2019, and it is possible that the U.K. may exit without an agreement in place. The uncertainties related to Brexit have cross-border operational, financial and tax implications, among others, and any economic volatility that may arise in the U.K., the E.U. or elsewhere may adversely affect our business.We may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions.We regularly evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses that are complementary to our businesses and client needs.

These actions could affect our business and reduce demand for certain of our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.As a global business we face certain risks of doing business internationally and we are exposed to risks from operating in high-growth markets and developing countries, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.The operational and financial performance of our international businesses are affected by global and regional economic conditions, competition for new business and talented staff, currency fluctuation, political conditions, regulatory environment and other risks associated with extensive international operations. In addition, we conduct business in numerous high-growth markets and developing countries which tend to have longer billing collection cycles, currency repatriation restrictions and commercial laws that can be undeveloped, vague, inconsistently enforced, retroactively applied or frequently changed. The risks associated with our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. Additionally, we are subject to U.S. and international anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, in all jurisdictions where we operate. These laws are complex and stringent and any violation of these laws could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation. For financial information by geographic region, see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.We may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions.We regularly evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses that are complementary to our businesses and client needs. As part of the process, we conduct business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in any particular transaction. Despite our efforts, we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks. As a result, the intended advantages of any given acquisition may not be realized. If we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions, our business, results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.Our goodwill is an intangible asset that may become impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP or GAAP, we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill related to our acquisitions; a substantial portion of which represents the intangible specialized know-how of the acquired workforce. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually at the end of the second quarter of the year and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows. While we have concluded, for each year presented in the financial statements included in this report, that our goodwill is not impaired, future events could cause us to conclude that the intangible asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired. Any resulting non-cash impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.We could be affected by future laws or regulations enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions.Generally, our businesses are not directly affected by current cap and trade laws and other regulatory requirements aimed at mitigating the impact of climate change by reducing emissions or otherwise; although, our businesses could be in the future. However, we could be indirectly affected by increased prices for goods or services provided to us by companies that are directly affected by these laws and regulations and pass their increased costs through to their customers. Further, if our clients are impacted by such laws or requirements, either directly or indirectly, their spending for advertising and marketing services may decline, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial position. Additionally, to comply with potential future changes in environmental laws and regulations, we may need to incur additional costs; therefore, at this time, we cannot estimate what impact such regulations may have on our business, results of operations and financial position.5"

Adverse economic conditions, a reduction in client spending, a deterioration in the credit markets, or a delay in client payments could have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.Adverse economic conditions have a direct impact on our business, results of operations and financial position. In particular, a global or regional economic downturn poses a risk that clients may reduce, postpone or cancel spending on advertising, marketing and corporate communications projects. Such actions would reduce the demand for our services and could result in a reduction in revenue, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position. Adverse economic conditions, including a contraction in the availability of credit, may make it more difficult for us to meet our working capital requirements and such events could cause our clients to delay payment for our services or take other actions that would negatively affect our working capital. In such circumstances, we may need to obtain additional financing to fund our day-to-day working capital requirements, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. Even if we take action to respond to adverse economic conditions and reductions in revenue by aligning our cost structure and managing our working capital, such actions may not be effective. In an economic downturn, the risk of a material loss related to media purchases and production costs incurred on behalf of our clients could significantly increase and methods for managing or mitigating such risk may be less available or unavailable.In the normal course of business, our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services. These commitments are included in accounts payable when the services are delivered by the media providers or production companies. If permitted by local law and the client agreement, many of our agencies purchase media and production services for our clients as an agent for a disclosed principal. In addition, while operating practices vary by country, media type and media vendor, in the United States and certain foreign markets, many of our agencies’ contracts with media and production providers specify that our agencies are not liable to the media and production providers under the theory of sequential liability until and to the extent we have been paid by our client for the media or production services.Where purchases of media and production services are made by our agencies as a principal or are not subject to the theory of sequential liability, the risk of a material loss as a result of payment default by our clients could increase significantly and such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.In addition, our methods of managing the risk of payment default, including obtaining credit insurance, requiring payment in advance, mitigating the potential loss in the marketplace or negotiating with media providers, may be less available or unavailable during a severe economic downturn.Clients periodically review and change their advertising, marketing and corporate communications requirements and relationships. If we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients, our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected.We operate in a highly competitive industry. Key competitive considerations for retaining existing clients and winning new clients include our ability to develop solutions that meet client needs in a rapidly changing environment, the quality and effectiveness of our services and our ability to serve clients efficiently, particularly large multinational clients, on a broad geographic basis. While many of our client relationships are long-standing, from time to time clients put their advertising, marketing and corporate communications business up for competitive review. We have won and lost accounts in the past as a result of these reviews. To the extent that we are not able to remain competitive or retain key clients, our revenue may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.3The loss of several of our largest clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.In 2015, approximately 52% of our revenue came from our 100 largest clients. Clients generally are able to reduce or cancel their current or future spending on advertising, marketing and corporate communications projects at any time on short notice for any reason. A significant reduction in spending on our services by our largest clients, or the loss of several of our largest clients, if not replaced by new clients or an increase in business from existing clients, would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.Acquiring new clients and retaining existing clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships, retaining key personnel and maintaining a highly skilled workforce.Our ability to acquire new clients and to retain existing clients may, in some cases, be limited by clients’ perceptions of, or policies concerning, conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships. If we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests, our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected.Our employees are our most important assets and our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our ability to provide our services in the manner clients have come to expect may be adversely affected, which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.Currency exchange rate fluctuations could impact our business, results of operations and financial position.Our international operations represent approximately 44% of our revenue. We operate in all major international markets including the European Union, the United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China and Japan. Our agencies transact business in more than 50 different currencies. Substantially all of our foreign operations transact business in their local currency and accordingly, their financial statements are translated into U.S. Dollars. As a result, both adverse and beneficial fluctuations in foreign exchange rates would impact our business, results of operations and financial position.We rely extensively on information technology systems and cybersecurity incidents could adversely affect us.We rely on information technology systems and infrastructure to process, store and transmit data, including personally identifiable information, summarize results and manage our business, including maintaining client advertising and marketing information. Our information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to system failures and network disruptions, malicious intrusion and random attack. Likewise, data security incidents and breaches by employees and others with or without permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Additionally, we use third parties, including cloud providers, to store, transmit or process data. There can be no assurance that the measures we have taken to protect our data and information technology systems will prevent system failures or network disruptions or breaches in our systems, or in the systems of third parties we use, and such events could adversely affect our reputation or business.Government regulation and consumer advocates may limit the scope and content of our services, which could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.Government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope, content and manner of presentation of advertising, marketing and corporate communications services, through regulation or other governmental action, which could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs. Such regulation may seek, among other things, to limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenditures by certain industries or for certain products and services. In addition, there has been a tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices and claims, which could cause our clients affected by such actions to reduce their spending on our services. Any limitation or judicial action that affects our ability to meet our clients' needs or reduces client spending on our services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.4Further, laws and regulations, related to user privacy, use of personal information and Internet tracking technologies have been proposed or enacted in the United States and certain international markets.

If domestic or global economic conditions deteriorate, our business, results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected. We will continue to monitor economic conditions closely, client revenue levels and other factors, and may take actions available to us to align our cost structure and manage working capital in response to reductions in client revenue. There can be no assurance whether, or to what extent, our efforts to mitigate any impact of future adverse economic conditions, reductions in our client revenue, changes in client creditworthiness and other developments will be effective.A reduction in client spending, a delay in client payments or conditions in the credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our working capital.Global economic uncertainty, turmoil in the credit markets or a contraction in the availability of credit may make it more difficult for us to meet our working capital requirements and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.

While we have taken what we believe are prudent measures to protect our data and information technology systems, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent system failures or network disruptions or breaches in our systems, or in systems of third parties we use, that could adversely affect our reputation or business.Government regulations and consumer advocates may limit the scope and content of our services, which could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.Government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope, content and manner of presentation of advertising, marketing and corporate communications services, through regulation or other governmental action. Any limitation on the scope or content of our services could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. In addition, there has been a tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices. Such actions by businesses or governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.Additionally, government or legislative action may limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenditures by certain industries or for certain products and services. These actions could cause our clients affected by such actions to reduce their spending on our services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.Further, laws and regulations, related to user privacy, use of personal information and Internet tracking technologies have been proposed or enacted in the United States and certain international markets. These laws and regulations could affect the acceptance of new communications technologies and the use of current communications technologies as advertising mediums. These actions could affect our business and reduce demand for certain of our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.We are a global service business and face certain risks of doing business abroad, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position and liquidity.We face a number of risks normally associated with a global service business. The operational and financial performance of our businesses are typically tied to overall economic and regional market conditions, competition for client assignments and talented staff, new business and the risks associated with extensive international operations. We also must comply with applicable U.S. local and other international anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, which can be complex and stringent, in all jurisdictions where we operate. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. For financial information on our operations by geographic region, see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements.5We are exposed to risks from operating in developing countries and high-growth markets.We conduct business in numerous developing countries and high-growth markets around the world. Our operations outside the United States are also exposed to risks that include: slower receipt of payments; social, political and economic instability, currency fluctuation and currency repatriation restrictions. In addition, commercial laws in developing countries and high-growth markets can be undeveloped, vague, inconsistently enforced or frequently changed. If we are deemed not to be in compliance with applicable laws in countries and markets where we conduct business, our prospects and business in those countries and markets could be harmed, which could then have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position.Downgrades of our debt credit ratings could adversely affect us.Standard and Poor’s Rating Service, or S&P, rates our long-term debt BBB+ and Moody’s Investors Service, or Moody's, rates our long-term debt Baa1. Our short-term debt ratings are A2 and P2 by the respective rating agencies. Our outstanding Senior Notes, Convertible Notes due July 31, 2032, or the 2032 Notes, and $2.5 billion Credit Agreement, or the Credit Agreement, do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payment upon a ratings downgrade. However, the interest rates and fees on our Credit Agreement would increase if our long-term debt credit ratings are downgraded. Also, our access to the capital markets could be adversely affected by downgrades in our short-term or long-term debt credit ratings. Our 2032 Notes would become convertible into shares of our common stock if the credit ratings assigned to the 2032 Notes are downgraded to BBB or lower by S&P or Baa3 or lower by Moody’s.We may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions.We regularly evaluate potential acquisition of businesses that we believe are complementary to our businesses and client needs. As part of the evaluation, we conduct business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in any particular transaction. Despite our efforts, we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks. As a result, we might not realize the intended advantages of any given acquisition. If we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.Our goodwill may become impaired, which could adversely effect our results of operations and financial position.In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP or GAAP, we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill in our consolidated financial statements resulting from our acquisition activities, which principally represents the specialized know-how of the workforce at the acquired businesses. As discussed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements, we test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually at the end of the second quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows. While we have concluded, for each year presented in the financial statements included in this report, that our goodwill is not impaired, future events could cause us to conclude that the asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired. Any resulting impairment charge, although non-cash, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.We could be affected by future laws or regulations enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions.Generally, our businesses are not directly affected by current cap and trade laws and other regulatory requirements aimed at mitigating the impact of climate change by reducing emissions or otherwise; although, our businesses could be in the future. However, we could be indirectly affected by increased prices for goods or services provided to us by companies that are directly affected by these laws and regulations and pass their increased costs through to their customers. Further, if our clients are impacted by such laws or requirements, either directly or indirectly, their spending for advertising and marketing services may decline, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. Additionally, to comply with potential future changes in environmental laws and regulations, we may need to incur additional costs. At this time, we cannot estimate what impact such costs may have on our results of operations and financial position"
3,OMC,OMNICOM GROUP,2013-02-19,"Risk Factors
Global economic conditions could adversely impact our business and results of operations and financial position.Global economic conditions have a direct impact on our business and financial performance. In particular, current global economic conditions pose a risk that our clients may reduce future spending on advertising and marketing services which could reduce the demand for our services. In 2012, the United States experienced modest economic growth and the major economies of Asia and Latin America continued to expand. However, the continuing fiscal issues faced by many countries in the Euro Zone has caused economic difficulty in certain of our Euro Zone markets. If economic conditions in these markets do not improve, the demand for our services could be further reduced. If domestic or global economic conditions worsen or do not improve, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected. We will continue to closely monitor economic conditions, client revenue levels and other factors and, in response to reductions in our client revenue, if necessary, we will take actions available to us to align our cost structure and manage working capital. There can be no assurance whether, or to what extent, our efforts to mitigate any impact of future economic conditions, reductions in our client revenue, changes in client creditworthiness and other developments will be effective.2In a period of severe economic downturn, the risk of a material loss related to media purchases and production costs incurred on behalf of our clients could significantly increase.In the normal course of business, we often enter into contractual commitments with media providers and agreements with production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services. Many of our agencies purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal. These commitments are included in accounts payable when the media services are delivered by the media providers. While operating practices vary by country, media type and media vendor, in the United States and certain foreign markets, many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligation, then we are not liable to the media providers under the theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client. In other countries, we manage our risk in other ways, including evaluating and monitoring our clients’ creditworthiness and, in many cases, obtaining credit insurance or requiring payment in advance. Further, in cases where we are committed to a media purchase and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media, options are potentially available to us in the marketplace, in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss, including negotiating with media providers. In addition, our agencies incur production costs on behalf of clients. We usually act as an agent for a disclosed principal in the procurement of these services. We manage the risk of payment default by the client by having the production companies be subject to sequential liability or requiring at least partial payment in advance from our client. However, the agreements entered into, as well as the production costs incurred, are unique to each client. The risk of a material loss could significantly increase in a severe economic downturn. Such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.A reduction in client spending or a delay in client payments could have a material adverse effect on our working capital.Global economic uncertainty could cause our clients to reduce spending on our services, delay the payment for our services or take additional actions that would negatively affect our working capital. Consequently, we could need to obtain additional financing in such circumstances. There is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on favorable terms, if at all. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.Companies periodically review and change their advertising, marketing and corporate communications services business models and relationships. If we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients, our business and results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected.The markets we operate in are highly competitive. Key competitive considerations for retaining existing business and winning new business include our ability to develop marketing solutions that meet client needs, the quality and effectiveness of the services we offer and our ability to efficiently serve clients, particularly large international clients, on a broad geographic basis. While many of our client relationships are long-standing, from time to time clients put their advertising, marketing and corporate communications services business up for competitive review. We have won and lost accounts in the past as a result of these reviews. To the extent that we are not able to remain competitive or retain key clients, our revenue may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.The success of our acquiring and retaining clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships, retention of key personnel and maintaining a highly skilled workforce.Our ability to retain existing clients and to attract new clients may, in some cases, be limited by clients’ perceptions of, or policies concerning, conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships. If we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests, our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected.Our employees are our most important assets and our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, including highly skilled technically proficient personnel, our ability to provide our services in the manner our customers have come to expect may be adversely affected, which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.Approximately 52% of our 2012 revenue came from our 100 largest clients and the loss of several of these clients could have a material adverse impact our results of operations and financial position.Our clients generally are able to reduce advertising and marketing spending or cancel projects at any time on short notice for any reason. It is possible that our clients could reduce spending in comparison to historical patterns, or they could reduce future spending. A significant reduction in advertising and marketing spending by our largest clients, or the loss of several of our largest clients, if not replaced by new clients or an increase in business from existing clients, would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.3We rely extensively on information technology systems.We rely on information technology systems and infrastructure to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business, including maintaining client marketing and advertising information. Our information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to system failures and network disruptions, malicious intrusion and random attack. Likewise, data security incidents and breaches by employees and others with or without permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Additionally, we utilize third parties, including cloud providers, to store, transfer or process data. While we have taken prudent measures to protect our data and information technology systems, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent system failures or network disruptions or breaches in our systems, or in systems of third parties we use, that could adversely affect our reputation or business.Government regulations and consumer advocates may limit the scope and content of our services, which could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.Government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope, content and manner of presentation of advertising, marketing and corporate communications services, through regulation or other governmental action. Any limitation on the scope or content of our services could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. In addition, there has been a tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices. Such actions by businesses or governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.Government or legislative action may limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenditures by certain industries or for certain products and services. These actions could cause our clients affected by such actions to reduce their spending on our services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.Laws and regulations, related to user privacy, use of personal information and Internet tracking technologies have been proposed or enacted in the United States and certain international markets. These laws and regulations could affect the acceptance of new communications technologies as advertising mediums. These actions could affect our business and reduce demand for certain of our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.We are a global service business and face certain risks of doing business abroad, including political instability and foreign exchange controls, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.We face a number of risks normally associated with a global service business. The operational and financial performance of our businesses are typically tied to overall economic and regional market conditions, competition for client assignments and talented staff, new business and the risks associated with extensive international operations. The risks of doing business abroad, including political instability and foreign exchange controls, do not affect domestic-focused firms. These risks could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial position. For financial information on our operations by geographic region, see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.We are exposed to risks from operating in developing countries.We conduct business in numerous developing countries around the world. Some of the risks associated with conducting business in developing countries include: slower payment of invoices; social, political and economic instability and foreign exchange controls. In addition, commercial laws in some developing countries can be vague, inconsistently administered and frequently changed. If we are deemed not to be in compliance with applicable laws in developing countries where we conduct business, our prospects and business in those countries could be harmed, which could then have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position.Conditions in the credit markets could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.Turmoil in the credit markets or a contraction in the availability of credit may make it more difficult for businesses to meet their working capital requirements and could lead clients to seek to change their financial relationship with their vendors, including us. If that were to occur, we may require additional financing to fund our day-to-day working capital requirements. There is no assurance that such additional financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all. Such circumstances could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position.4Holders of our convertible notes have the right to require us to repurchase approximately $660 million of notes, in whole or in part, on specific dates in the future.On June 15, 2013, $406.6 million of our Convertible Notes due July 1, 2038, or the 2038 Notes, may be put back to us for repurchase and on July 31, 2013, $252.7 million of our Convertible Notes due July 31, 2032, or the 2032 Notes, may be put back to us for repurchase. If our convertible notes are put back to us, we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund the repurchases. We also believe that we will have sufficient capacity under our $2.5 billion Credit Agreement, or the Credit Agreement, to meet our cash requirements for our normal business operations after any repurchase. However, in the event that availability under our Credit Agreement or our cash flow from operations were to decrease, we may need to seek additional funding. There is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on comparable terms, if at all.Downgrades of our debt credit ratings could adversely affect us.Standard and Poor’s Rating Service, or S&P, rates our long-term debt BBB+ and Moody’s Investors Service, or Moody's, rates our long-term debt Baa1. Our short-term debt ratings are A2 and P2 by the respective rating agencies. Our outstanding senior notes, convertible notes and Credit Agreement do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payment upon a ratings downgrade. However, the interest rates and fees on our Credit Agreement would increase if our long-term debt credit ratings are downgraded. Additionally, our access to the capital markets could be adversely affected by downgrades in our short-term or long-term debt credit ratings. Furthermore, the 2032 Notes and 2038 Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at specified ratios if, in the case of the 2032 Notes, our long-term debt credit ratings are downgraded to BBB or lower by S&P, or Baa3 or lower by Moody’s or in the case of the 2038 Notes to BBB- or lower by S&P, and Ba1 or lower by Moody’s. These events would not, however, result in an adjustment of the number of shares issuable upon conversion and would not accelerate the holder’s right to cause us to repurchase the notes.We may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions.We regularly evaluate potential acquisition of businesses that we believe are complementary to our businesses and client needs. As part of the evaluation, we conduct business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in any particular transaction. Despite our efforts, we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks. As a result, we might not realize the intended advantages of any given acquisition. If we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.Our goodwill may become impaired, which could adversely effect our results of operations and financial position.In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP or GAAP, we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill in our consolidated financial statements resulting from our acquisition activities, which principally represents the specialized know-how of the workforce at the acquired businesses.

Global economic conditions could adversely impact our business and results of operations and financial position.Our business and financial performance are impacted by global economic conditions. In 2011, the United States experienced modest economic growth and the major economies of Asia and Latin America continued to expand. However, Europe continued to experience economic difficulty and the economic conditions in Europe continue to be negatively affected by the ongoing European sovereign debt crisis. If the economic conditions worsen, the downturn may expand beyond Europe and could cause reductions in client spending levels and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.

The global economic recession could continue to adversely impact our business and results of operations and financial condition.     Contractions in the availability of business and consumer credit, a decrease in consumer and business spending, a significant rise in unemployment and other factors have all contributed to a global economic recession.To some extent, every industry sector in most markets around the world has been adversely affected by the current economic conditions. This has led to discretionary reductions in advertising, marketing and corporate communications services spendingby both our U.S. and international clients and was a contributing factor to the year-over-year decrease in our revenues in the fourth quarter of 2008.     We expect that clients marketing spending will continue to contract for the near term. If the global economic recession continues, our clients businesses could be adversely affected which would likely leadto reductions in client spending. These reductions could adversely affect our business and results of operations and financial condition.The global credit crisis could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.     The bursting of the housing bubble and the related mortgage defaults that followed ultimately led to a crisis in the credit markets and a contraction in the availability of credit. This crisis has made it more difficultfor businesses to meet their capital requirements.     A continuation of the credit crisis coupled with a prolonged economic recession could lead clients to change their financial relationship with their vendors, including us. If that were to occur, we could requireadditional capital to fund the changes in our day-to-day working capital requirements. There is no assurance that such additional financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all. This could materially adversely impact our results ofoperations and financial condition.     Additionally, in connection with the global credit crisis, several banks in the bank syndicate that supports our $2.5 billion credit facility received capital infusions from their central governments. In the eventthat a bank in our syndicate were to default on its obligation to fund its commitment under our credit facility or cease to exist and there was no successor entity, the credit facility provides that the remaining banks in the syndicate would only berequired to fund advances requested under the credit facility on a pro rata basis up to their total commitment. As a result, the portion of the credit facility provided by the defaulting bank would not be available to us and we could requireadditional capital. There is no assurance that such additional financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all. This could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.In a period of severe economic downturn, the risk of a material loss related to purchases of media on behalf of our clients could significantly increase.     In many of our businesses we purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal. We enter into contractual commitments with media providers on behalf of our clients at levels that substantiallyexceed our revenue. These commitments are included in our accounts payable balance when the media services are delivered by the media providers. While operating practices vary by country, media type and media vendor,3in the United States and certain foreign markets many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligations then we are not liable to the media providers under the legal theory of sequential liabilityuntil we have been paid for the media by our client. In other countries, we manage our risk in other ways, including evaluating and monitoring our clients credit worthiness and, in many cases, requiring credit insurance or payment in advance.Further, in cases where we become committed to the media and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media, options are potentially available to us in the marketplace in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potentialloss, including negotiating with media providers. This risk could significantly increase in periods of severe economic downturn. Such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.A reduction in client spending and a slowdown in client payments could materially adversely affect our working capital.     Working capital is a source of cash as we have historically run a negative working capital cycle during the year. This cycle occurs because our businesses incur costs on behalf of our clients, including when we placemedia and incur production costs. We generally require collection from our clients prior to our payment for the media and production cost obligations.     The global economic recession could cause a reduction in the volume of client spending or a delay in the time our clients take to pay us which would negatively affect our working capital. Consequently, we could need toobtain additional financing. There is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on favorable terms, if at all. Such circumstances could therefore materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Companies periodically review and change their advertising, marketing and corporate communications services business models and relationships. If we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients, our business and financial results maybe materially adversely affected.     The businesses in which we participate are highly competitive. Key competitive considerations for retaining existing business and winning new business include our ability to develop creative solutions that meet clientneeds, the quality and effectiveness of the services we offer, and our ability to efficiently serve clients, particularly large international clients, on a broad geographic basis. While many of our client relationships are long-standing, clients puttheir advertising, marketing and corporate communications services business up for competitive review from time to time. We have won and lost accounts in the past as a result of these reviews. To the extent that we are not able to remaincompetitive, our revenue may be adversely affected, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We received approximately 47% of our revenue from our 100 largest clients in 2008, and the loss of several of these clients could adversely impact our prospects, business and results of operations and financial condition.     Our clients generally are able to reduce advertising and marketing spending or cancel projects at any time on short notice for any reason. It is possible that our clients could reduce spending in comparison withhistorical patterns, or they could reduce future spending. A significant reduction in advertising and marketing spending by our largest clients, or the loss of several of our largest clients, if not replaced by new client accounts or an increase inbusiness from existing clients, would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.The success of our acquiring and retaining clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising out of other client relationships and retention of key personnel.     Our ability to retain existing clients and to attract new clients may, in some cases, be limited by clients perceptions of, or policies concerning, conflicts of interest arising out of other client relationships.If we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests, our business and financial results may be materially adversely affected.     In addition, we may lose or fail to attract and retain key personnel. Our employees are our most important assets. Our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness. If we areunable to attract and retain key personnel, our ability to provide our services in the manner our customers have come to expect may be adversely affected, which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients, which could have a materialadverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.4Government regulations and consumer advocates may limit the scope of the content of our services, which could affect our ability to meet our clients needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.     Government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope, content and manner of presentation of advertising, marketing and corporate communications services, throughregulations or other governmental actions. Any such limitations on the scope of the content of our services could affect our ability to meet our clients needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations andfinancial condition. In addition, there has been an increasing tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices. Such claims by businesses or governmental agencies could have a material adverseeffect on our results of operations and financial condition in the future.We are a global service business and face certain risks of doing business abroad, including political instability and exchange controls, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.     We face the risks normally associated with global services businesses. The operational and financial performance of our businesses are typically tied to overall economic and regional market conditions, competition forclient assignments and talented staff, new business wins and losses and the risks associated with extensive international operations. There are risks of doing business abroad, including those of political instability and exchange controls, which donot affect domestic-focused firms. These risks could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition. For financial information on our operations by geographic area, see Note 4 to our consolidated financialstatements.We are exposed to risks from operating in developing countries.     We conduct business in numerous developing countries around the world. The risks associated with conducting business in developing countries can include slower payment of invoices, nationalization, social, political andeconomic instability and currency repatriation restrictions, among other risks. In addition, commercial laws in many of these countries can be vague, inconsistently administered and retroactively applied. If we are deemed not to be in compliancewith applicable laws in developing countries where we conduct business, our prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations in those countries could be harmed, which could then have a material adverse impact on our results ofoperations and financial condition.Holders of our convertible notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to $1.2 billion, in whole or in part, at specified dates in the future.     In July 2009, $727 million of our 2032 Notes can be put back to us for repurchase. In June 2010, our 2033 and 2038 Notesaggregating $467.5 million can be put to us for repurchase. (See next paragraph regarding our 2031 Notes) If we are required to satisfy one or more puts to repurchase our convertible notes, we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund the puts. We alsobelieve that we will still have capacity under our existing credit commitments sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of our business operations after any put event. However, in the event that our existing credit commitmentsor our cash flow from operations were to decrease, we might need to seek additional funding alternatives. There is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on favorable terms, if at all.     On February 9, 2009, holders of $841.2 million aggregate principal amount of our 2031 Notes had put their notes to us for purchase at par. We borrowed $814.4 million under our credit facility and received$26.8 million from unaffiliated equity investors in a partnership we control to fund the purchase of the 2031 Notes. We purchased and retired $295.2 million aggregate principal amount of the 2031 Notes that had been put. The partnership,formed for the purpose of buying the 2031 Notes, used a portion of our credit facility borrowings and the contributed equity to purchase the remaining $546.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2031 Notes that were put. The partnershippurchased the 2031 Notes intending to sell such notes back into the marketplace over the next 12 months if market conditions permit.Downgrades of our debt credit ratings could adversely affect us.     Standard and Poors Rating Service currently rates our long-term debt A-, Moodys Investors Service rates our long-term debt Baa1 and Fitch Ratings rates our long-term debt A-. Our short-term debt ratings areA2, P2 and F2 by the respective agencies. Our outstanding senior notes, convertible notes and existing bank credit facility do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payment upon a downgrade. The interest rates and fees on our bank credit facility, however, would increase if our long-term debt credit rating is downgraded.5 Additionally, our access to the capital markets could be adversely affected by adverse changes to the short- orlong-term debt credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies. Furthermore, the 2031, 2032, 2033 and 2038 Notes are convertible at specified ratios if, in the case of the 2031 Notes and the 2032 Notes, our long-term debt credit ratingsare downgraded to BBB or lower by Standard & Poors Ratings Service, or Baa3 or lower by Moodys Investors Service or in the case of the 2033 and 2038 Notes to BBB- or lower by S&P, and Ba1 or lower by Moodys. These eventswould not, however, result in an adjustment of the number of shares issuable upon conversion and would not accelerate the holders right to cause us to repurchase the notes.We may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions.     We regularly review potential acquisitions of businesses we believe may be complementary to our businesses and client needs. As part of the review we conduct business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal ofidentifying and evaluating material risks involved in any particular transaction. Despite our efforts, we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks. As a result, we might not realize the intended advantages of any givenacquisition. If we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.Goodwill may become impaired.     In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP or GAAP), we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill in our consolidated financial statements resulting from ouracquisition activities, which principally represents the specialized know-how of the workforce at the agencies we have acquired. We annually test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment, as discussed in Note 1 to our consolidated financialstatements. The estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows. While we have concluded, for each yearpresented in our financial statements included in this report, that our goodwill is not impaired, future events could cause us to conclude that the asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired. Any resulting impairment losscould materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition"
