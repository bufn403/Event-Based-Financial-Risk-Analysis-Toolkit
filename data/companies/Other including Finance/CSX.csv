The risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the Company's forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.Regulatory, Legislative and LegalNew legislation, regulatory changes or other governmental actions could impact the Company's earnings or restrict its ability to independently negotiate prices.Legislation passed by Congress, new regulations issued by federal agencies, or executive orders issued by the President of the United States could significantly affect the revenues, costs, including income taxes, and profitability of the Company's business. In addition, statutes or regulations that, among other things, impose price constraints or affecting rail-to-rail competition could adversely affect the Company's profitability. Government regulation and compliance risks may adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results.The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies, including the STB, FRA, PHMSA, TSA, EPA and other state, provincial, local and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic, health, safety, labor, environmental, tax, legal, cybersecurity and other matters. New or modified rules or regulations by these agencies could increase the Company's operating costs, adversely impact revenue or reduce operating efficiencies and affect service performance. Noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the Company and can subject the Company to fines, penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions. CSXT, as a common carrier by rail, is required by law to transport hazardous materials and could be adversely impacted by non-compliance with applicable regulations or from regulatory and legislative changes.CSXT is required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials and has a legal obligation to transport certain hazardous materials under the common carrier mandate. Applicable rules issued by the TSA place significant security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers, rail transit systems and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail. Noncompliance with these rules can subject the Company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident. Finally, legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances, which could increase operating costs, reduce operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials.CSX 2023 Form 10-K p.7CSX CORPORATIONPART IThe Company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures.As part of its railroad and other operations, the Company is subject to various claims and lawsuits related to disputes over commercial practices, labor and unemployment matters, occupational and personal injury claims, property damage or freight damage, environmental and other matters. The Company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend existing and future lawsuits. Although the Company maintains insurance to cover some of these types of claims and establishes reserves when appropriate, final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may exceed the Company's insurance coverage or differ materially from the recorded reserves. Additionally, the Company could be impacted by adverse developments not currently reflected in the Company's reserve estimates.Operational, Safety and Business DisruptionAn epidemic or pandemic and the initiatives to reduce its transmission could adversely affect the Company's business.The Company could be materially and adversely affected by a public health crisis, including a widespread epidemic or pandemic. During a health crisis, policies and initiatives may be instituted by the public and private sector to reduce transmission, such as closures of businesses and manufacturing facilities, the promotion of social distancing, the adoption of working from home by companies and institutions, and travel restrictions. These policies or initiatives could adversely affect demand for the commodities and products that the Company transports, including import and export volume. In addition, initiatives to reduce transmission could result in supply chain disruptions, which could impact volumes and make it more difficult for the Company to serve its customers. Moreover, operations are negatively affected when a significant number of employees are quarantined as the result of exposure to a contagious illness. To the extent a public health crisis adversely affects the Company's business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein.The Company relies on the security, stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business.The Company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business. The security, stability and availability of the Company’s and its key third-party vendors’ information technology systems are critical to its ability to operate safely and effectively and to compete within the transportation industry. A successful data breach, cyber-attack, or the occurrence of any similar incident that impacts the Company’s or its key third-party vendors’ information technology systems could result in a service interruption, train accident, misappropriation of confidential or proprietary information (including personal information), process failure, or other operational difficulties. A disruption or compromise of the Company’s or its key third-party vendors' information technology systems, even for short periods of time, and any resulting theft or compromise of Company confidential or proprietary information (including personal information), could adversely affect the Company’s business or reputation, create significant legal, regulatory or financial exposure and have a material adverse impact on CSX’s business, financial condition or operations.CSX 2023 Form 10-K p.8CSX CORPORATIONPART IThe Company, its third-party vendors and other companies in the rail and transportation industries have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, data breaches, cyber-attacks and other similar incidents. These incidents may include, among other things, malware, ransomware, distributed denial of service attacks, social engineering, phishing, theft, malfeasance or improper access by employees or third-party vendors, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, human error, fraud, or other modes of attack or disruption. Attacks of these nature are increasing in frequency, levels of persistence, intensity and sophistication, including by nation-state threat actors or those associated with nation-states. Further, the Company may be at increased risk of experiencing a cyber-attack as a result of being a component of the critical U.S. infrastructure. If such an event takes place, the Company may be required to incur significant expenses in excess of existing cybersecurity insurance coverage. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities, data breaches, cyber-attacks or other similar incidents. The Company or its third-party vendors may also experience cybersecurity incidents as a result of employees, third-party vendors and other third parties with which they interact working remotely on less secure systems and environments.Despite the Company’s efforts to protect its information technology systems, it may not be able to prevent or anticipate all data breaches, cyber-attacks or other similar incidents, detect or react to such incidents in a timely manner or adequately remediate any such incident. Due to applicable laws, rules and regulations or contractual obligations, CSX may be held responsible for data breaches, cyber-attacks or other similar incidents attributed to its third-party vendors as they relate to the information CSX shares with them.Additionally, if CSX is unable to successfully acquire, develop or implement new technology, including artificial intelligence, it may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation services.Network or supply chain constraints could have a negative impact on service, operating efficiency or volume of shipments.CSXT could experience rail network difficulties related to: (i) locomotive or crew shortages;  (ii) labor shortages or other service disruptions in the supply chain affecting trucking, ports, handling facilities, customer facilities or other railroads; (iii) unpredictable increases in demand; (iv) extreme weather conditions;  (v) regulatory changes resulting in forced access or impacting where and how fast CSXT can transport freight or maintain routes; (vi) reductions in availability of pooled equipment, including chassis; (vii) impacts from changes in network capacity or structure; or (viii) increased passenger activities, which could impact CSXT's operational fluidity, leading to deterioration of service, asset utilization and overall efficiency.CSXT, as a common carrier by rail, transports hazardous materials, which could expose the Company to significant costs and claims in the event of a train accident.A train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant costs and claims arising from personal injury, property or natural resource damage, environmental penalties and remediation obligations. Such claims, if insured, could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Under federal regulations, CSXT is required to transport certain hazardous materials under the legal duty referred to as the common carrier mandate regardless of risk or potential exposure to loss.CSX 2023 Form 10-K p.9CSX CORPORATIONPART IFuture acts of terrorism, war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the Company's operations.Terrorist attacks, along with any government response to those attacks, may adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. CSXT's rail lines, other key infrastructure and information technology systems may be targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war. This risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. In addition, premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company could increase dramatically, or the coverage may no longer be available.Furthermore, in response to the heightened risk of terrorism, federal, state and local governmental bodies are proposing and, in some cases, have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry. For example, the Department of Homeland Security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials. Complying with these or future regulations could continue to increase the Company's operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies.Severe weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage.The Company's operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences, including floods, hurricanes, fires and earthquakes. As a result, the Company's rail network may be damaged, its workforce may be unavailable, fuel costs may rise and significant business interruptions could occur. In addition, the performance of locomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions. Hurricanes as well as storm and flooding events have impacted the Company's network in the past, leading to interrupted service and damage to track and equipment. Changes in weather patterns caused by climate change are expected to increase the frequency, severity or duration of certain adverse weather conditions. Insurance maintained by the Company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the Company's damages or damages to others, and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Even with insurance, if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service, the Company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations.Competitive, Economic and FinancialThe Company faces competition from other transportation providers.The Company experiences competition in pricing, service, reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines. Other transportation providers generally use public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities, while CSXT and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks largely using internal resources. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation such as through the use of automation, autonomy or electrification, or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks, could negatively impact the Company's competitive position. Additionally, any future consolidation in the rail industry could materially affect the regulatory and competitive environment in which the Company operates.CSX 2023 Form 10-K p.10CSX CORPORATIONPART IGlobal economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight.A decline or disruption in general domestic and global economic conditions that affects demand for the commodities and products the Company transports, including import and export volume, could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects on the Company's cost structure and profitability. For example, slower rates of economic growth in Asia, contraction of European economies, and changes in the global supply of seaborne coal or price of seaborne coal have adverse impacts on U.S. export coal volume and result in lower coal revenue for CSX. Additionally, embargoes or changes to trade agreements or policies could result in reduced import and export volumes due to increased tariffs and lower consumer demand. If the Company experiences significant declines in demand for its transportation services with respect to one or more commodities and products or continues to experience the impacts of inflation, the Company may experience reduced revenue and increased operating costs, workforce adjustments, and other related activities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.Changing dynamics in the U.S. and global energy markets could negatively impact profitability.Over time, changing dynamics in the U.S. and global energy markets, including the impacts of regulation and alternative fuel sources, have resulted in lower energy production from coal-fired power plants in CSX's service territory. Changes in natural gas prices, or other factors impacting demand for electricity, could impact future power generation at coal-fired plants, which would affect the Company's coal volumes and revenues. Weaknesses in the capital and credit markets could negatively impact the Company’s access to capital.The Company regularly relies on capital markets for the issuance of long-term debt instruments, commercial paper and bank financing from time to time. Instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including credit markets, significant increases in interest rates, or the deterioration of the Company’s financial condition due to internal or external factors, could restrict or prohibit access and could increase financing costs. A significant deterioration of the Company’s financial condition could also reduce credit ratings and could limit or affect its access to external sources of capital and increase the costs of short and long-term debt financing.Availability of Critical Supplies and LaborThe unavailability of critical resources could adversely affect the Company’s operational efficiency and ability to meet demand. Marketplace conditions for resources like locomotives as well as the availability of qualified personnel, including engineers and conductors as well as other skilled professional or technical employees, could each have a negative impact on the Company’s ability to meet demand for rail service. Although the Company strives to maintain adequate resources and personnel for the current business environment, unpredictable increases in demand for rail services or extreme weather conditions may exacerbate such risks, which could have a negative impact on the Company’s operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular period. CSX 2023 Form 10-K p.11CSX CORPORATIONPART IDisruption to a key railroad industry supplier could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs.The capital intensive and unique nature of core rail equipment (including rail, ties, freight cars and locomotives) limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers. If any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage, CSXT could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage. In addition, a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and, as such, adverse developments in international relations, new trade regulations, disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase CSXT's costs. Additionally, if a fuel supply shortage were to arise, the Company would be negatively impacted.Failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes and/or work stoppages. Most of CSX's employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements are either bargained for nationally by the National Carriers Conference Committee or locally between CSX and the union. Such agreements are negotiated over the course of several years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages. Under the Railway Labor Act's procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods and the possibility of an intervention by the President of the United States), during negotiations neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted. If, however, CSX is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements, the employees covered by the Railway Labor Act could strike, which could result in loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members. Climate Change and EnvironmentalThe Company’s operations and financial results could be negatively impacted by climate change and regulatory and legislative responses to climate change.There is potential for operational impacts from changing weather patterns or rising sea levels in the Company's operational territory, which could impact the Company's network or other assets. Climate change and other emissions-related laws and regulations have been proposed and, in some cases adopted, on the federal, state, provincial and local levels. These final and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions, caps, taxes or other controls on emissions as well as requirements to disclose information relating to climate change. In particular, the EPA has issued various regulations and may issue additional regulations targeting emissions, including rules and standards governing emissions from certain stationary sources and from vehicles. Any of these pending or proposed laws or regulations, could adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results by, among other things: (i) reducing coal-fired electricity generation due to mandated emission standards; (ii) reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the United States and Canada; (iii) increasing the Company's fuel, capital and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies; and (iv) making it difficult for the Company's customers in the U.S. and Canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner. Any of these factors could reduce the amount of shipments the Company handles and have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. In addition, CSX may become subject to legal requirements to disclose climate change related information and may become subject to demands or expectations by its supply chain partners, customers or other stakeholders to disclose information relating to climate risk or set related targets or goals. The Company's current practices with respect to climate risk disclosure may fail to meet these developing legal requirements or stakeholder demands or expectations. In addition, legislative or regulatory uncertainties and change regarding climate-related risks, including inconsistent perspectives or requirements, are likely to result in higher regulatory, compliance, credit, reputational and other risks and costs.CSX 2023 Form 10-K p.12CSX CORPORATIONPART IThe Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs.The Company is subject to wide-ranging federal, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions into the air, ground and water; the handling, storage, use, generation, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials; the clean-up of hazardous material and petroleum releases and the health and safety of our employees. If the Company violates or fails to comply with these laws and regulations, CSX could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. The Company can also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to any hazardous substances for which CSX is responsible. In certain circumstances, environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties, leased properties, adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or Company predecessors, as well as to properties currently owned, leased or used by the Company.The Company has been, and may in the future be, subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated, or is strictly liable under, environmental laws or regulations, and such violations can result in the Company's incurring fines, penalties or costs relating to the cleanup of environmental contamination. Although the Company believes it has appropriately recorded current and long-term liabilities for known and reasonably estimable future environmental costs, it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing. The Company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown or future environmental contamination"

Under federal regulations, CSXT is required to transport hazardous materials under the legal duty referred to as the common carrier mandate.CSXT is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials.  In November 2008, the TSA issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers, rail transit systems and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail. Noncompliance with these rules can subject the Company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident. Finally, legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances, which could increase operating costs, reduce operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials.CSX 2022 Form 10-K p.7CSX CORPORATIONPART IThe Company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures.As part of its railroad and other operations, the Company is subject to various claims and lawsuits related to disputes over commercial practices, labor and unemployment matters, occupational and personal injury claims, property damage, environmental and other matters. The Company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend existing and future lawsuits.

A disruption or compromise of the Company’s information technology systems, even for short periods of time, and any resulting theft or compromise of Company confidential or proprietary information (including personal information), could adversely affect the Company’s business or reputation, create significant legal, regulatory or financial exposure and have a material adverse impact on CSX’s business, financial condition or operations.CSX 2022 Form 10-K p.8CSX CORPORATIONPART IThe Company, its third-party vendors and other companies in the rail and transportation industries have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, data breaches, cyber-attacks and other similar incidents. These incidents may include, among other things, malware, ransomware, distributed denial of service attacks, social engineering, phishing, theft, malfeasance or improper access by employees or third-party vendors, human error, fraud, or other modes of attack or disruption. Attacks of these nature are increasing in frequency, levels of persistence, intensity and sophistication. Further, the Company may be at increased risk of a cyber-attack as a result of being a component of the critical U.S. infrastructure.

While CSX’s security protocols have detected attempts to gain unauthorized access to the Company’s information technology systems, none of such attempts have resulted in any material breach of or disruption to the Company’s systems. For example, CSX has experienced distributed denial of service attacks that have resulted in brief system disruptions, but none have resulted in access to CSX systems. Additionally, despite routine security assessment of the Company’s key third-party vendors, some vendors have experienced cyber-attacks in the past, but none of such attacks have had a material adverse impact on CSX’s business or operations. Due to applicable laws and regulations or contractual obligations, CSX may be held responsible for data breaches, cyber-attacks or other similar incidents attributed to its third-party vendors as they relate to the information CSX shares with them.Additionally, if CSX is unable to acquire, develop or implement new technology, it may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service.Network or supply chain constraints could have a negative impact on service, operating efficiency or volume of shipments.CSXT could experience rail network difficulties related to: (i) locomotive or crew shortages;  (ii) labor shortages or other service disruptions in the supply chain affecting trucking, ports, handling facilities, customer facilities or other railroads; (iii) unpredictable increases in demand; (iv) extreme weather conditions;  (v) regulatory changes resulting in forced access or impacting where and how fast CSXT can transport freight or maintain routes; (vi) reductions in availability of pooled equipment, including chassis; (vii) impacts from changes in network capacity or structure; or (viii) increased passenger activities, which could impact CSXT's operational fluidity, leading to deterioration of service, asset utilization and overall efficiency.Future acts of terrorism, war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the Company's operations.Terrorist attacks, along with any government response to those attacks, may adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. CSXT's rail lines, other key infrastructure and information technology systems may be targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war. This risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. In addition, premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company could increase dramatically, or the coverage may no longer be available.CSX 2022 Form 10-K p.9CSX CORPORATIONPART IFurthermore, in response to the heightened risk of terrorism, federal, state and local governmental bodies are proposing and, in some cases, have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry. For example, the Department of Homeland Security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials.

Any of these pending or proposed laws or regulations, including any proposed or implemented under the Biden administration, could adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results by, among other things: (i) reducing coal-fired electricity generation due to mandated emission standards; (ii) reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the United States and Canada; (iii) increasing the Company's fuel, capital and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies; and (iv) making it difficult for the Company's customers in the U.S. and Canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner. Any of these factors could reduce the amount of shipments the Company handles and have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs.The Company is subject to wide-ranging federal, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions into the air, ground and water; the handling, storage, use, generation, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials; the clean-up of hazardous material and petroleum releases and the health and safety of our employees. If the Company violates or fails to comply with these laws and regulations, CSX could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. The Company can also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to any hazardous substances for which CSX is responsible. In certain circumstances, environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties, leased properties, adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or Company predecessors, as well as to properties currently owned, leased or used by the Company.The Company has been, and may in the future be, subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated, or is strictly liable under, environmental laws or regulations, and such violations can result in the Company's incurring fines, penalties or costs relating to the cleanup of environmental contamination. Although the Company believes it has appropriately recorded current and long-term liabilities for known and reasonably estimable future environmental costs, it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing. The Company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown or future environmental contamination"

    The risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the Company's forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.Regulatory, Legislative and LegalNew legislation or regulatory changes could impact the Company's earnings or restrict its ability to independently negotiate prices.Legislation passed by Congress, new regulations issued by federal agencies or executive orders issued by the President of the United States could significantly affect the revenues, costs, including income taxes, and profitability of the Company's business. In addition, statutes or regulations imposing price constraints or affecting rail-to-rail competition could adversely affect the Company's profitability. Government regulation and compliance risks may adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results.The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies, including the STB, FRA, PHMSA, TSA, EPA and other state, provincial and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic, health, safety, labor, environmental, tax, legal and other matters. New or modified rules or regulations by these agencies could increase the Company's operating costs, adversely impact revenue or reduce operating efficiencies and affect service performance. Noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the Company and can subject the Company to fines, penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions. CSXT, as a common carrier by rail, is required by law to transport hazardous materials, which could expose the Company to significant costs and claims.A train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury, property or natural resource damage, environmental penalties and remediation obligations. Such claims, if insured, could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Under federal regulations, CSXT is required to transport hazardous materials under the legal duty referred to as the common carrier mandate.CSXT is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials.  In November 2008, the TSA issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers, rail transit systems and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail. Noncompliance with these rules can subject the Company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident. Finally, legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances, which could increase operating costs, reduce operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials.CSX 2021 Form 10-K p.7CSX CORPORATIONPART IThe Company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures.As part of its railroad and other operations, the Company is subject to various claims and lawsuits related to disputes over commercial practices, labor and unemployment matters, occupational and personal injury claims, property damage, environmental and other matters. The Company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend existing and future lawsuits. Although the Company maintains insurance to cover some of these types of claims and establishes reserves when appropriate, final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may exceed the Company's insurance coverage or differ materially from the recorded reserves. Additionally, the Company could be impacted by adverse developments not currently reflected in the Company's reserve estimates.Operational, Safety and Business DisruptionAn epidemic or pandemic, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and the initiatives to reduce its transmission could adversely affect the Company's business.The Company could be materially and adversely affected by a public health crisis, including a widespread epidemic or pandemic. As COVID-19 and its variant strains have spread globally, including significant impacts in the United States, CSX continues to take a variety of measures to ensure the availability of its transportation services, promote the safety and security of its employees and support the communities in which it operates. However, public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as closures of businesses and manufacturing facilities, the promotion of social distancing, the adoption of working from home by companies and institutions, and travel restrictions could continue to adversely affect demand for the commodities and products that the Company transports, including import and export volume. In addition, COVID-19 and the related initiatives to reduce transmission have resulted in greater supply chain disruption, which could continue to impact volumes and make it more difficult for the Company to serve its customers. The extent to which COVID-19 continues to impact operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the outbreak, its effects on demand for the Company’s transportation services and the supply chain, as well as the effect of governmental regulations imposed in response to the pandemic. The duration of the pandemic is dependent on several factors, including the impacts of virus variants and case resurgences across the country. Moreover, operations are negatively affected when a significant number of employees are quarantined as the result of exposure to a contagious illness. To the extent COVID-19 adversely affects the Company's business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein.The Company relies on the security, stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business.The Company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business. The security, stability and availability of the Company’s and its key third-party vendors’ technology systems are critical to its ability to operate safely and effectively and to compete within the transportation industry. A successful data breach, cyber-attack, or the occurrence of any similar incident that impacts the Company’s or its key third-party vendors’ information technology systems could result in a service interruption, train accident, misappropriation of confidential or proprietary information (including personal information), process failure, or other operational difficulties. A disruption or compromise of the Company’s information technology systems, even for short periods of time, and any resulting theft or compromise of Company confidential or proprietary information (including personal information), could adversely affect the Company’s business or reputation, create significant legal, regulatory or financial exposure and have a material adverse impact on CSX’s business, financial condition or operations.CSX 2021 Form 10-K p.8CSX CORPORATIONPART IThe Company, its third-party vendors and other companies in the rail and transportation industries have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, data breaches, cyber-attacks and other similar incidents. These incidents may include, among other things, malware, ransomware, distributed denial of service attacks, social engineering, phishing, theft, malfeasance or improper access by employees or third-party vendors, human error, fraud, or other modes of attack or disruption. Attacks of these nature are increasing in frequency, levels of persistence, intensity and sophistication. Further, the Company may be at increased risk of a cyber-attack as a result of being a component of the critical U.S. infrastructure. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities, data breaches, cyber-attacks or other similar incidents. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic also increases the risk that the Company or its third-party vendors may experience cybersecurity incidents as a result of employees, third-party vendors and other third parties with which they interact working remotely on less secure systems and environments.Despite the Company’s efforts to protect its information technology systems, it may not be able to prevent or anticipate all data breaches, cyber-attacks or other similar incidents, detect or react to such incidents in a timely manner or adequately remediate any such incident. While CSX’s security protocols have detected attempts to gain unauthorized access to the Company’s information technology systems, none of such attempts have resulted in any material breach of or disruption to the Company’s systems. For example, CSX has experienced distributed denial of service attacks that have resulted in brief system disruptions, but none have resulted in access to CSX systems. Additionally, despite routine security assessment of the Company’s key third-party vendors, some vendors have experienced cyber-attacks in the past, but none of such attacks have had a material adverse impact on CSX’s business or operations. Due to applicable laws and regulations or contractual obligations, CSX may be held responsible for data breaches, cyber-attacks or other similar incidents attributed to its third-party vendors as they relate to the information CSX shares with them.Network or supply chain constraints could have a negative impact on service, operating efficiency or volume of shipments.CSXT could experience rail network difficulties related to: (i) unpredictable increases in demand; (ii) locomotive or crew shortages; (iii) labor shortages or other service disruptions in the supply chain affecting trucking, ports, handling facilities, customer facilities or other railroads; (iv) reductions in availability of pooled equipment, including chassis; (v) extreme weather conditions; (vi) impacts from changes in yard capacity, or network structure or composition, including train routes; (vii) increased passenger activities; or (viii) regulatory changes resulting in forced access or impacting where and how fast CSXT can transport freight or maintain routes, which could impact CSXT's operational fluidity, leading to deterioration of service, asset utilization and overall efficiency.Future acts of terrorism, war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the Company's operations.Terrorist attacks, along with any government response to those attacks, may adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. CSXT's rail lines, other key infrastructure and information technology systems may be targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war. This risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. In addition, premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company could increase dramatically, or the coverage may no longer be available.CSX 2021 Form 10-K p.9CSX CORPORATIONPART IFurthermore, in response to the heightened risk of terrorism, federal, state and local governmental bodies are proposing and, in some cases, have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry. For example, the Department of Homeland Security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials. Complying with these or future regulations could continue to increase the Company's operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies.Severe weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage.The Company's operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences, including floods, fires, hurricanes and earthquakes. As a result, the Company's rail network may be damaged, its workforce may be unavailable, fuel costs may rise and significant business interruptions could occur. In addition, the performance of locomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions. Insurance maintained by the Company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the Company's damages or damages to others, and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Even with insurance, if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service, the Company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations.Competitive, Economic and FinancialThe Company faces competition from other transportation providers.The Company experiences competition in pricing, service, reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines. Other transportation providers generally use public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities, while CSXT and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks largely using internal resources. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation such as through the use of automation, autonomy or electrification, or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks, could negatively impact the Company's competitive position. Additionally, any future consolidation in the rail industry could materially affect the regulatory and competitive environment in which the Company operates.Global economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight.A decline or disruption in general domestic and global economic conditions that affects demand for the commodities and products the Company transports, including import and export volume, could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects on the Company's cost structure and profitability. For example, slower rates of economic growth in Asia, contraction of European economies, and changes in the global supply of seaborne coal or price of seaborne coal have adverse impacts on U.S. export coal volume and result in lower coal revenue for CSX. Additionally, changes to trade agreements or policies could result in reduced import and export volumes due to increased tariffs and lower consumer demand. If the Company experiences significant declines in demand for its transportation services with respect to one or more commodities and products, the Company may experience reduced revenue and increased operating costs, workforce adjustments, and other related activities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. CSX 2021 Form 10-K p.10CSX CORPORATIONPART IChanging dynamics in the U.S. and global energy markets could negatively impact profitability.Over time, changing dynamics in the U.S. and global energy markets have resulted in lower energy production from coal-fired power plants in CSX's service territory. Changes in natural gas prices, or other factors impacting demand for electricity, could impact future power generation at coal-fired plants, which would affect the Company's domestic coal volumes and revenues. Weaknesses in the capital and credit markets could negatively impact the Company’s access to capital.The Company regularly relies on capital markets for the issuance of long-term debt instruments, commercial paper and bank financing from time to time. Instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including credit markets, or the deterioration of the Company’s financial condition due to internal or external factors, could restrict or prohibit access and could increase financing costs. A significant deterioration of the Company’s financial condition could also reduce credit ratings and could limit or affect its access to external sources of capital and increase the costs of short and long-term debt financing.Availability of Critical Supplies and LaborThe unavailability of critical resources could adversely affect the Company’s operational efficiency and ability to meet demand. Marketplace conditions for resources like locomotives as well as the availability of qualified personnel, particularly engineers and conductors, could each have a negative impact on the Company’s ability to meet demand for rail service. Although the Company strives to maintain adequate resources and personnel for the current business environment, unpredictable increases in demand for rail services or extreme weather conditions may exacerbate such risks, which could have a negative impact on the Company’s operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular period. Disruption to a key railroad industry supplier could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs.The capital intensive and unique nature of core rail equipment (including rail, ties, rolling stock equipment and locomotives) limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers. If any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage, CSXT could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage. In addition, a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and, as such, adverse developments in international relations, new trade regulations, disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase CSXT's costs. Additionally, if a fuel supply shortage were to arise, the Company would be negatively impacted.Failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes and/or work stoppages. Most of CSX's employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements are either bargained for nationally by the National Carriers Conference Committee or locally between CSX and the union. Such agreements are negotiated over the course of several years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages. Under the Railway Labor Act's procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods and the possibility of an intervention by the President of the United States), during negotiations neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted. If, however, CSX is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements, the employees covered by the Railway Labor Act could strike, which could result in loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members. CSX 2021 Form 10-K p.11CSX CORPORATIONPART IClimate Change and EnvironmentalThe Company’s operations and financial results could be negatively impacted by climate change and regulatory and legislative responses to climate change.There is potential for operational impacts from changing weather patterns or rising sea levels in the Company's operational territory, which could impact the Company's network or other assets. Climate change and other emissions-related laws and regulations have been proposed and, in some cases adopted, on the federal, state, provincial and local levels. These final and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions, caps, taxes or other controls on emissions. In particular, the EPA has issued various regulations and may issue additional regulations targeting emissions, including rules and standards governing emissions from certain stationary sources and from vehicles.Any of these pending or proposed laws or regulations, including any proposed or implemented under the Biden administration, could adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results by, among other things: (i) reducing coal-fired electricity generation due to mandated emission standards; (ii) reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the United States and Canada; (iii) increasing the Company's fuel, capital and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies; and (iv) making it difficult for the Company's customers in the U.S. and Canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner. Any of these factors could reduce the amount of shipments the Company handles and have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs.The Company is subject to wide-ranging federal, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions into the air, ground and water; the handling, storage, use, generation, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials; the clean-up of hazardous material and petroleum releases and the health and safety of our employees. If the Company violates or fails to comply with these laws and regulations, CSX could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. The Company can also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to any hazardous substances for which CSX is responsible. In certain circumstances, environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties, leased properties, adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or Company predecessors, as well as to properties currently owned, leased or used by the Company.The Company has been, and may in the future be, subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated, or is strictly liable under, environmental laws or regulations, and such violations can result in the Company's incurring fines, penalties or costs relating to the cleanup of environmental contamination. Although the Company believes it has appropriately recorded current and long-term liabilities for known and reasonably estimable future environmental costs, it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing. The Company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown or future environmental contamination"

The performance and reliability of the Company's technology systems are critical to its ability to operate and compete safely and effectively. A cybersecurity attack, which is a deliberate theft of data or impairment of information technology systems, or other significant disruption or failure, could result in a service interruption, train accident, misappropriation of confidential information, process failure, security breach or other operational difficulties. Such an event could result in decreased revenues and increased capital, insurance or operating costs, including increased security costs to protect the Company's infrastructure. Insurance maintained by the Company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from cyber incidents may not be sufficient to cover all damages. A disruption or compromise of the Company's information technology systems, even for short periods of time, could have a material adverse effect.

As a result of sustained low natural gas prices, many coal-fired power plants have been displaced by natural gas-fired power generation facilities. If natural gas prices were to remain low, additional coal-fired plants could be displaced, which would likely further reduce the Company's domestic coal volumes and revenues. Additionally, crude oil prices combined with changes in pipeline capacity have resulted in volatility in domestic crude oil production, which has affected crude oil volumes for CSX.Weaknesses in the capital and credit markets could negatively impact the Company’s access to capital.The Company regularly relies on capital markets for the issuance of long-term debt instruments, commercial paper and bank financing from time to time.

Although the Company believes it has appropriately recorded current and long-term liabilities for known and reasonably estimable future environmental costs, it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing. The Company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown or future environmental contamination.CSX 2020 Form 10-K p.12CSX CORPORATIONPART IAvailability of Critical Supplies and LaborDisruption to a key railroad industry supplier could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs.The capital intensive and unique nature of core rail equipment (including rail, ties, rolling stock equipment and locomotives) limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers. If any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage, CSXT could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage. In addition, a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and, as such, adverse developments in international relations, new trade regulations, disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase CSXT's costs. Additionally, if a fuel supply shortage were to arise, the Company would be negatively impacted.Failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes and/or work stoppages. Most of CSX's employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements are either bargained for nationally by the National Carriers Conference Committee or locally between CSX and the union. Such agreements are negotiated over the course of several years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages. Under the Railway Labor Act's procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods and the possibility of an intervention by the President of the United States), during negotiations neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted. If, however, CSX is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements, the employees covered by the Railway Labor Act could strike, which could result in loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members. The unavailability of critical resources could adversely affect the Company’s operational efficiency and ability to meet demand. Marketplace conditions for resources like locomotives as well as the availability of qualified personnel, particularly engineers and conductors, could each have a negative impact on the Company’s ability to meet demand for rail service. Although the Company believes that it has adequate resources and personnel for the current business environment, unpredictable increases in demand for rail services or extreme weather conditions may exacerbate such risks, which could have a negative impact on the Company’s operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular period"
14,CSX,CSX CORP,2020-02-12,"  Risk Factors
The risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the Company's forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. New legislation or regulatory changes could impact the Company's earnings or restrict its ability to independently negotiate prices.Legislation passed by Congress, new regulations issued by federal agencies or executive orders issued by the President of the United States could significantly affect the revenues, costs and profitability of the Company's business. In addition, statutes or regulations imposing price constraints or affecting rail-to-rail competition could adversely affect the Company's profitability. Government regulation and compliance risks may adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results.The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies, including the STB, FRA, PHMSA, TSA, EPA and other state, provincial and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic, health, safety, labor, environmental, tax, legal and other matters. New or modified rules or regulations by these agencies could increase the Company's operating costs, adversely impact revenue or reduce operating efficiencies and affect service performance. For example, the RSIA, as amended, mandated that the installation of PTC hardware be completed by December 31, 2018, and requires that the PTC system be fully operational by December 31, 2020 on main lines that carry certain hazardous materials and on lines that have commuter or passenger operations. Although CSX remains on track to meet this regulatory requirement, noncompliance with these and other applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the Company and can subject the Company to fines, penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions. CSXT, as a common carrier by rail, is required by law to transport hazardous materials, which could expose the Company to significant costs and claims.A train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury, property or natural resource damage, environmental penalties and remediation obligations.  Such claims, if insured, could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates.  Under federal regulations, CSXT is required to transport hazardous materials under the legal duty referred to as the common carrier mandate.CSXT is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials.  In November 2008, the TSA issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers, rail transit systems and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail.  Noncompliance with these rules can subject the Company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident. Finally, legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances, which could increase operating costs, reduce operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials.CSX 2019 Form 10-K p. 7CSX CORPORATIONPART IThe Company faces competition from other transportation providers.The Company experiences competition in pricing, service, reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines. Other transportation providers generally use public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities, while CSXT and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks largely using internal resources. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation such as through the use of automation, autonomy or electrification, or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks, could negatively impact the Company's competitive position. Additionally, any future consolidation in the rail industry could materially affect the regulatory and competitive environment in which the Company operates.Global economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight.A decline or disruption in general domestic and global economic conditions that affects demand for the commodities and products the Company transports, including import and export volume, could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects on the Company's cost structure and profitability. For example, slower rates of economic growth in Asia, contraction of European economies, and changes in the global supply of seaborne coal or price of seaborne coal have adverse impacts on U.S. export coal volume and result in lower coal revenue for CSX. Additionally, changes to trade agreements or policies could result in reduced import and export volumes due to increased tariffs and lower consumer demand. If the Company experiences significant declines in demand for its transportation services with respect to one or more commodities and products, the Company may experience reduced revenue and increased operating costs, workforce adjustments, and other related activities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Changing dynamics in the U.S. and global energy markets could negatively impact profitability.Increases in production and source locations of natural gas in the U.S. have resulted in lower natural gas prices in CSX’s service territory. As a result of sustained low natural gas prices, many coal-fired power plants have been displaced by natural gas-fired power generation facilities. If natural gas prices were to remain low, additional coal-fired plants could be displaced, which would likely further reduce the Company's domestic coal volumes and revenues. Additionally, crude oil prices combined with increased pipeline activity have resulted in volatility in domestic crude oil production, which has affected crude oil volumes for CSX.The Company relies on the security, stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business.The Company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business. The performance and reliability of the Company's technology systems are critical to its ability to operate and compete safely and effectively. A cybersecurity attack, which is a deliberate theft of data or impairment of information technology systems, or other significant disruption or failure, could result in a service interruption, train accident, misappropriation of confidential information, process failure, security breach or other operational difficulties.  Such an event could result in decreased revenues and increased capital, insurance or operating costs, including increased security costs to protect the Company's infrastructure. Insurance maintained by the Company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from cyber incidents may not be sufficient to cover all damages. A disruption or compromise of the Company's information technology systems, even for short periods of time, could have a material adverse effect.

This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the Company's damages or damages to others, and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Even with insurance, if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service, the Company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations.CSX 2019 Form 10-K p. 10CSX CORPORATIONPART IFailure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes and/or work stoppages.

The risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the Company's forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. New legislation or regulatory changes could impact the Company's earnings or restrict its ability to independently negotiate prices.Legislation passed by Congress, new regulations issued by federal agencies or executive orders issued by the President of the United States could significantly affect the revenues, costs and profitability of the Company's business. For instance, several of the proposals under consideration by the STB could have a significant negative impact on the Company's ability to negotiate prices for the value of rail services provided and meet service standards, which could force a reduction in capital spending. In addition, statutes imposing price constraints or affecting rail-to-rail competition could adversely affect the Company's profitability. Government regulation and compliance risks may adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results.The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies, including the STB, FRA, PHMSA, TSA, EPA and other state, provincial and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic, health, safety, labor, environmental, tax, legal and other matters. New or modified rules or regulations by these agencies could increase the Company's operating costs or reduce operating efficiencies and impact service performance.  For example, the RSIA mandates that the installation of PTC hardware be completed by December 31, 2018 and, assuming certain conditions are met, requires that the PTC system be fully operational by December 31, 2020 on main lines that carry certain hazardous materials and on lines that have commuter or passenger operations. Although CSX remains on track to meet this regulatory requirement, noncompliance with these and other applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the Company and can subject the Company to fines, penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions. The Company’s business strategies may not achieve the anticipated objectives.The implementation of the Company’s business strategies could result in operational disruptions, loss of existing customers, regulatory issues and other adverse consequences. If these strategies fail to achieve the anticipated benefits or take longer to implement than expected, the Company’s operations and financial results may be adversely affected.Failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes and/or work stoppages. Most of CSX's employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Approximately 70 percent of these agreements are bargained for nationally by the National Carriers Conference Committee and negotiated over the course of several years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages. Under the Railway Labor Act's procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods and the possibility of an intervention of the U.S. President), during negotiations neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted. If, however, CSX is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements, or if terms of existing agreements are disputed, the employees covered by the Railway Labor Act could strike, which could result in loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members. Additionally, from time to time, the Company enters into CSX-specific, or “local”, bargaining agreements which could also be critical to the Company and its new business strategies.CSX 2017 Form 10-K p. 8CSX CORPORATIONPART INetwork constraints could have a negative impact on service and operating efficiency.CSXT could experience rail network difficulties related to: (i) increased volume; (ii) locomotive or crew shortages; (iii) extreme weather conditions; (iv) impacts from changes in yard capacity, or network structure or composition, including train routes; (v) increased passenger activities, including high-speed rail; or (vi) regulatory changes impacting where and how fast CSXT can transport freight or maintain routes, which could have a negative effect on CSXT's operational fluidity, leading to deterioration of service, asset utilization and overall efficiency.Global economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight.A decline or disruption in general domestic and global economic conditions that affects demand for the commodities and products the Company transports, including import and export volume, could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects on the Company's cost structure and profitability. For example, if the rate of economic growth in Asia slows, European economies contract, or if the global supply of seaborne coal or price of seaborne coal changes from its current levels, U.S. export coal volume could be adversely impacted resulting in lower revenue for CSX. Additionally, changes to trade agreements or policies could result in reduced import and export volumes due to increased tariffs and lower consumer demand. If the Company experiences significant declines in demand for its transportation services with respect to one or more commodities and products, the Company may experience reduced revenue and increased operating costs, workforce adjustments, and other related activities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Changing dynamics in the U.S. and global energy markets could negatively impact profitability.Over the past few years, production and source locations of natural gas in the U.S. have also increased dramatically, which has resulted in lower natural gas prices in CSX’s service territory. As a result of sustained low natural gas prices, many coal-fired power plants have been displaced by natural gas-fired power generation facilities. If natural gas prices were to remain low, additional coal-fired plants could be displaced, which would likely further reduce the Company's domestic coal volumes and revenues. Additionally, crude oil prices combined with increased pipeline activity have resulted in volatility in domestic crude oil production, which has adversely affected crude oil volumes for CSX.CSXT, as a common carrier by rail, is required by law to transport hazardous materials, which could expose the Company to significant costs and claims.A train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury, property or natural resource damage, environmental penalties and remediation obligations.  Such claims, if insured, could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates.  Under federal regulations, CSXT is required to transport hazardous materials under the legal duty referred to as the common carrier mandate.CSXT is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials.  In November 2008, the TSA issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers, rail transit systems and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail.  Noncompliance with these rules can subject the Company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident.  Finally, legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances, which could increase operating costs, reduce operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials.CSX 2017 Form 10-K p. 9CSX CORPORATIONPART IClimate change and other emissions-related laws and regulations could adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results.Climate change and other emissions-related laws and regulations have been proposed and, in some cases adopted, on the federal, state, provincial and local levels. These final and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions, caps, taxes or other controls on emissions. In particular, the EPA has issued various regulations and may issue additional regulations targeting emissions, including rules and standards governing emissions from certain stationary sources and from vehicles.Any of these pending or proposed laws or regulations could adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results by, among other things: (i) reducing coal-fired electricity generation due to mandated emission standards; (ii) reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the United States and Canada; (iii) increasing the Company's fuel, capital and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies; and (iv) making it difficult for the Company's customers in the U.S. and Canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner. Any of these factors could reduce the amount of shipments the Company handles and have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs.The Company is subject to wide-ranging federal, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions into the air, ground and water; the handling, storage, use, generation, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials; the clean-up of hazardous material and petroleum releases and the health and safety of our employees. If the Company violates or fails to comply with these laws and regulations, CSX could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. The Company can also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to any hazardous substances for which CSX is responsible. In certain circumstances, environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties, leased properties, adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or Company predecessors, as well as to properties currently owned, leased or used by the Company.The Company has been, and may in the future be, subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated, or is strictly liable under, environmental laws or regulations, and such violations can result in the Company's incurring fines, penalties or costs relating to the clean-up of environmental contamination. Although the Company believes it has appropriately recorded current and long-term liabilities for known and reasonably estimable future environmental costs, it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing. The Company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown or future environmental contamination. The Company relies on the security, stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business.The Company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business. The performance and reliability of the Company's technology systems are critical to its ability to operate and compete safely and effectively. A cybersecurity attack, which is a deliberate theft of data or impairment of information technology systems, or other significant disruption or failure, could result in a service interruption, train accident, misappropriation of confidential information, process failure, security breach or other operational difficulties.  Such an event could result in decreased revenues and increased capital, insurance or operating costs, including increased security costs to protect the Company's infrastructure. Insurance maintained by the Company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from cyber incidents may not be sufficient to cover all damages. A disruption or compromise of the Company's information technology systems, even for short periods of time, could have a material adverse effect. CSX 2017 Form 10-K p. 10CSX CORPORATIONPART IDisruption of the supply chain could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs.The capital intensive nature and sophistication of core rail equipment (including rolling stock equipment, locomotives, rail, and ties) limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers. If any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage, CSXT could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage. In addition, a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and, as such, adverse developments in international relations, new trade regulations, disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase CSXT's operating costs. Additionally, if a fuel supply shortage were to arise, the Company would be negatively impacted.The Company faces competition from other transportation providers.The Company experiences competition in pricing, service, reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines. Other transportation providers generally use public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities, while CSXT and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks largely using internal resources. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation such as through the use of automation, autonomy or electrification, or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks, could negatively impact the Company's competitive position. Additionally, any future consolidation in the rail industry could materially affect the regulatory and competitive environment in which the Company operates.Future acts of terrorism, war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the Company's operations.Terrorist attacks, along with any government response to those attacks, may adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  CSXT's rail lines, other key infrastructure and information technology systems may be targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war.  This risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues.  In addition, premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company could increase dramatically, or the coverage may no longer be available. Furthermore, in response to the heightened risk of terrorism, federal, state and local governmental bodies are proposing and, in some cases, have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry.  For example, the Department of Homeland Security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials.  Complying with these or future regulations could continue to increase the Company's operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies.Severe weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage.The Company's operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences, including floods, fires, hurricanes and earthquakes.  As a result, the Company's rail network may be damaged, its workforce may be unavailable, fuel costs may rise and significant business interruptions could occur.  In addition, the performance of locomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions.  Insurance maintained by the Company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the Company's damages or damages to others, and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Even with insurance, if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service, the Company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations.CSX 2017 Form 10-K p. 11CSX CORPORATIONPART IThe Company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures.As part of its railroad and other operations, the Company is subject to various claims and lawsuits related to disputes over commercial practices, labor and unemployment matters, occupational and personal injury claims, property damage, environmental and other matters.  The Company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend existing and future lawsuits.  Although the Company maintains insurance to cover some of these types of claims and establishes reserves when appropriate, final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may exceed the Company's insurance coverage or differ materially from the recorded reserves. Additionally, the Company could be impacted by adverse developments not currently reflected in the Company's reserve estimates.The unavailability of critical resources could adversely affect the Company’s operational efficiency and ability to meet demand. Marketplace conditions for resources like locomotives as well as the availability of qualified personnel, particularly engineers and conductors, could each have a negative impact on the Company’s ability to meet demand for rail service. Although the Company believes that it has adequate personnel for the current business environment, unpredictable increases in demand for rail services or extreme weather conditions may exacerbate such risks, which could have a negative impact on the Company’s operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular period. Weaknesses in the capital and credit markets could negatively impact the Company’s access to capital.Due to the significant capital expenditures required to operate and maintain a safe and efficient railroad, the Company regularly relies on capital markets for the issuance of long-term debt instruments as well as on bank financing from time to time. Instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including credit markets, or the deterioration of the Company’s financial condition due to internal or external factors, could restrict or prohibit access and could increase the cost of financing sources.  A significant deterioration of the Company’s financial condition could also reduce credit ratings and could limit or affect its access to external sources of capital and increase the costs of short and long-term debt financing"

As a result of sustained low natural gas prices, many coal-fired power plants have been displaced by natural gas-fired power generation facilities.  If natural gas prices were to remain low, additional coal-fired plants could be displaced, which would likely further reduce the Company's domestic coal volumes and revenues.      Additionally, depressed crude oil prices due to increased supply or lower demand could result in a further decrease in domestic crude oil production, which could have an adverse effect on crude oil volumes for CSX. In addition, new regulations related to the shipment of crude oil by rail, including proposed rail car safety standards, could increase costs for CSX, negatively impact network fluidity or have an adverse impact on customers.

The uncertainties associated with such activities could interfere with the Company’s ability to effectively execute its strategic plan, impact customer retention and long-term growth, and limit the Company's ability to hire and retain personnel. In addition, a proxy contest for the election of directors could require the Company to incur significant legal fees and proxy solicitation expenses and require significant time and attention by management and the board of directors.

If the Company experiences significant declines in demand for its transportation services with respect to one or more commodities and products, the Company may experience reduced revenue and increased operating costs associated with the storage of locomotives, railcars and other equipment, workforce adjustments, and other related activities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.     Changing dynamics in the U.S. and global energy markets could negatively impact profitability.Over the past few years, production of natural gas in the U.S. has also increased dramatically, which has resulted in lower natural gas prices.  As a result of sustained low natural gas prices, many coal-fired power plants have been displaced by natural gas-fired power generation facilities.  If natural gas prices were to remain low, additional coal-fired plants could be displaced, which would likely further reduce the Company's domestic coal volumes and revenues.      Additionally, depressed crude oil prices due to increased supply or lower demand could result in a decrease in domestic crude oil production, which could have an adverse effect on crude oil volumes for CSX. In addition, new regulations related to the shipment of crude oil by rail, including proposed rail car safety standards, could increase costs for CSX, negatively impact network fluidity or have an adverse impact on customers.  7CSX CORPORATIONPART ICSXT, as a common carrier by rail, is required by law to transport hazardous materials, which could expose the Company to significant costs and claims. A train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury, property or natural resource damage, environmental penalties and remediation obligations.  Such claims, if insured, could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates.  Under federal regulations, CSXT is required to transport hazardous materials under the legal duty referred to as the common carrier mandate.    CSXT is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials.  In November 2008, the TSA issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers, rail transit systems and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail.  Noncompliance with these rules can subject the Company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident.  Finally, legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances, which could increase operating costs, reduce operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials. The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs.The Company is subject to wide-ranging federal, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions into the air, ground and water; the handling, storage, use, generation, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials; the clean-up of hazardous material and petroleum releases and the health and safety of our employees.  If the Company violates or fails to comply with these laws and regulations, CSX could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators.  The Company can also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to any hazardous substances for which CSX is responsible.  In certain circumstances, environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties, leased properties, adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or Company predecessors, as well as to properties currently owned, leased or used by the Company.   The Company has been, and may in the future be, subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated, or is strictly liable under, environmental laws or regulations, and such violations can result in the Company's incurring fines, penalties or costs relating to the clean-up of environmental contamination. Although the Company believes it has appropriately recorded current and long-term liabilities for known and reasonably estimable future environmental costs, it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing.  The Company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown or future environmental contamination. The Company relies on the security, stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business.The Company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business.  The performance and reliability of the Company's technology systems are critical to its ability to operate and compete safely and effectively.  A cybersecurity attack, which is a deliberate theft of data or impairment of information technology systems, or other significant disruption or failure, could result in a service interruption, train accident, misappropriation of confidential information, process failure, security breach or other operational difficulties.  Such an event could result in increased capital, insurance or operating costs, including increased security costs to protect the Company's infrastructure.  A disruption or compromise of the Company's information technology systems, even for short periods of time, could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 8CSX CORPORATIONPART IDisruption of the supply chain could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs.     The capital intensive nature and sophistication of core rail equipment (including rolling stock equipment, locomotives, rail, and ties) limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers.  If any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage, CSXT could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage.  In addition, a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and, as such, adverse developments in international relations, new trade regulations, disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase CSXT's operating costs.  Additionally, if a fuel supply shortage were to arise, whether due to production restrictions, lower refinery outputs, a disruption of oil imports, adverse political developments or otherwise, the Company would be negatively impacted. Failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes and/or work stoppages.     Most of CSX's employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Most of these agreements are bargained for nationally by the National Carriers Conference Committee and negotiated over the course of several years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages.  Under the Railway Labor Act's procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods and the possibility of an intervention of the U.S. President), during negotiations neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted.  If, however, CSX is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements, or if terms of existing agreements are disputed, the employees covered by the Railway Labor Act could strike, which could result in loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members.   The Company faces competition from other transportation providers. The Company experiences competition in pricing, service, reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines. Other transportation providers generally use public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities, while CSXT and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks largely using internal resources. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation, or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks, could negatively impact the Company's competitive position.  Additionally, any future consolidation in the rail industry could materially affect the regulatory and competitive environment in which the Company operates.Future acts of terrorism, war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the Company's operations.     Terrorist attacks, along with any government response to those attacks, may adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  CSXT's rail lines, other key infrastructure and information technology systems may be direct targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war.  This risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues.  In addition, premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company could increase dramatically, or the coverage may no longer be available. Furthermore, in response to the heightened risk of terrorism, federal, state and local governmental bodies are proposing and, in some cases, have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry.  For example, the Department of Homeland Security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials.  Complying with these or future regulations could continue to increase the Company's operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies. 9CSX CORPORATIONPART ISevere weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage.     The Company's operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences, including floods, fires, hurricanes and earthquakes.  As a result, the Company's rail network may be damaged, its workforce may be unavailable, fuel costs may rise and significant business interruptions could occur.  In addition, the performance of locomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions.  Insurance maintained by the Company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the Company's damages or damages to others, and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Even with insurance, if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service, the Company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations.The Company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures.     As part of its railroad and other operations, the Company is subject to various claims and lawsuits related to disputes over commercial practices, labor and unemployment matters, occupational and personal injury claims, property damage, environmental and other matters.  The Company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend existing and future lawsuits.  Although the Company establishes reserves and maintains insurance to cover these types of claims, final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may differ materially from the recorded reserves and exceed the Company's insurance coverage.   Additionally, the Company is subject to adverse developments not currently reflected in the Company's reserve estimates. The unavailability of critical resources could adversely affect the Company’s operational efficiency and ability to meet demand. Marketplace conditions for resources like locomotives as well as the availability of qualified personnel, particularly engineers and trainmen, could each have a negative impact on the Company’s ability to meet demand for rail service.  Although the Company believes that it has adequate personnel for the current business environment, unpredictable increases in demand for rail services or extreme weather conditions may exacerbate such risks, which could have a negative impact on the Company’s operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular period.Weaknesses in the capital and credit markets could negatively impact the Company’s access to capital.Due to the significant capital expenditures required to operate and maintain a safe and efficient railroad, the Company regularly relies on capital markets for the issuance of long-term debt instruments as well as on bank financing from time to time. Instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including credit markets, or the deterioration of the Company’s financial condition due to internal or external factors, could restrict or prohibit access and could increase the cost of financing sources.  A significant deterioration of the Company’s financial condition could also reduce credit ratings and could limit or affect its access to external sources of capital and increase the costs of short and long-term debt financing"

If the Company experiences significant declines in demand for its transportation services with respect to one or more commodities and products, the Company may experience reduced revenue and increased operating costs associated with the storage of locomotives, railcars and other equipment, workforce adjustments, and other related activities, which could have a material adverse effect on operations, financial condition and liquidity.     Changing dynamics in the U.S. and global energy markets could negatively impact profitability.Domestic energy production continues to evolve creating both opportunities and challenges for CSX. Increased production of crude oil from the new domestic oil fields, particularly those located in the Bakken Shale region of North Dakota, has created opportunities for CSX to transport crude oil by rail to East Coast refineries. Crude oil production from this region is subject to the volatility of global crude oil prices. Depressed crude oil prices due to increased supply or lower demand could result in a decrease in domestic crude oil production, which could have an adverse effect on crude oil volumes for CSX. In addition, new regulations related to the shipment of crude oil by rail, including proposed rail car safety standards, could increase costs for CSX, negatively impact network fluidity or have an adverse impact on customers. Over the past few years, production of natural gas in the U.S. has also increased dramatically, which has resulted in lower natural gas prices.  As a result of sustained low natural gas prices, coal-fired power plants have been displaced by natural gas-fired power generation facilities.

In November 2008, the TSA issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers, rail transit systems, and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail.  Noncompliance with these rules can subject the Company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident.  Finally, legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances, which could increase operating costs, reduce operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials. The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs.The Company is subject to wide-ranging federal, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions into the air,  ground and water, the handling, storage, use, generation, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials, the clean-up of hazardous material and petroleum releases, and the health and safety of our employees.  If we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators.  We can also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to any hazardous substances for which we are responsible.  In certain circumstances, environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties, leased properties, adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or Company predecessors, as well as to properties currently owned, leased or used by the Company.    8Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IThe Company has been, and may in the future, be subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated, or is strictly liable under, environmental laws or regulations, and such violations can result in the Company's incurring fines, penalties or costs relating to the clean-up of environmental contamination. Although the Company believes it has appropriately recorded current and long-term liabilities for known and reasonably estimable future environmental costs, it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing.  The Company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown or future environmental contamination. The Company relies on the stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business. The Company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business.  The performance and reliability of the Company's technology systems are critical to its ability to operate and compete safely and effectively.  A cybersecurity attack, which is a deliberate theft of data or impairment of information technology systems, or other significant disruption or failure could result in a service interruption, train accident, misappropriation of confidential information, process failure, security breach or other operational difficulties.  Such an event could result in increased capital, insurance or operating costs, including increased security costs to protect the Company's infrastructure.  A disruption or compromise of the Company's information technology systems, even for short periods of time, could have a material adverse effect on the Company.Disruption of the supply chain could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs. The capital intensive nature and sophistication of core rail equipment (including rolling stock equipment, locomotives, rail, and ties) limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers.  If any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage, CSXT could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage.  In addition, a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and, as such, adverse developments in international relations, new trade regulations, disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase CSXT's operating costs. Additionally, if a fuel supply shortage were to arise, whether due to production restrictions, lower refinery outputs, a disruption of oil imports, adverse political developments or otherwise, the Company would be negatively impacted. Failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes and/or work stoppages. Most of CSX's employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Most of these agreements are bargained for nationally by the National Carriers Conference Committee and negotiated over the course of several years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages.  Under the Railway Labor Act's procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods and the possibility of Presidential intervention), during negotiations neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted.  If, however, CSX is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements, or if terms of existing agreements are disputed, the employees covered by the Railway Labor Act could strike, which could result in loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members.    9Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IThe Company faces competition from other transportation providers. The Company experiences competition in pricing, service, reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines. Other transportation providers generally use public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities, while CSXT and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks largely using internal resources. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation, or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks, could negatively impact the Company's competitive position. Future acts of terrorism, war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the Company's operations. Terrorist attacks, along with any government response to those attacks, may adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  CSXT's rail lines or other key infrastructure may be direct targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war.  This risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues.  In addition, premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company could increase dramatically, or the coverage may no longer be available. Furthermore, in response to the heightened risk of terrorism, federal, state and local governmental bodies are proposing and, in some cases, have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry.  For example, the Department of Homeland Security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials.  Complying with these or future regulations could continue to increase the Company's operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies.Severe weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage. The Company's operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences, including floods, fires, hurricanes and earthquakes.  As a result, the Company's rail network may be damaged, its workforce may be unavailable, fuel costs may rise and significant business interruptions could occur.  In addition, the performance of locomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions.  Insurance maintained by the Company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the Company's damages or damages to others, and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Even with insurance, if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service, the Company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations. The Company may be subject to lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures. The Company is subject to various claims and lawsuits, including putative class action litigation alleging violations of antitrust laws.  The Company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend existing and future lawsuits.  Additionally, existing litigation may suffer adverse developments not currently reflected in the Company's reserve estimates as the ultimate outcome of existing litigation is subject to numerous factors outside of the Company's control.  Final judgments or settlement amounts may differ materially from the recorded reserves. 10Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IIncreases in the number and magnitude of property damage and personal injury claims could adversely affect the Company's operating results. The Company faces inherent business risk from exposure to occupational and personal injury claims, property damage, including storm damage, and claims related to train accidents.  The Company may incur significant costs to restore these damages and defend such claims.  Existing claims may suffer adverse developments not currently reflected in reserve estimates, as the ultimate outcome of existing claims is subject to numerous factors outside of the Company's control.

 The risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the Company's forward-looking statements.  Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 6Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART INew legislation or regulatory changes could impact the Company's earnings or restrict its ability to independently negotiate prices. Legislation passed by Congress or new regulations issued by federal agencies can significantly affect the revenues, costs and profitability of the Company's business.  For instance, several of the proposals under consideration by the STB could have a significant negative impact on the Company's ability to determine prices for rail services and meet service standards, which could force a reduction in capital spending.  In addition, statutes imposing price constraints or affecting rail-to-rail competition could adversely affect the Company's profitability. Government regulation and compliance risks may adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results. The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies, including the STB, the FRA and other state and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic, health, safety, labor, environmental, tax, legal and other matters.  New rules or regulations by these agencies could increase the Company's operating costs or reduce operating efficiencies.  For example, the RSIA mandated that the installation of an interoperable positive train control system (“PTC”) be completed by December 31, 2015 on main lines that carry certain hazardous materials and on lines that have commuter or passenger operations.  In January 2010, the FRA issued its final rule on the design, operational requirements and implementation of the new PTC technology.  In 2012, federal legislation was introduced in both the House of Representatives and the Senate that would, if reintroduced and approved in 2013, delay the PTC implementation deadline of 2015 by three to five years. However, even if either the regulatory requirements or the implementation date are further revised, the rule will continue to impose significant new costs on the Company and the rail industry.  Noncompliance with these and other applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the Company and can subject the Company to fines, penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions. Climate change and other emissions-related legislation and regulation could adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results. Climate change and other emissions-related legislation and regulation have been proposed and, in some cases adopted, on the federal, state, provincial (Canada) and local levels.  These final and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions, caps, taxes or other controls on emissions.  In particular, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has issued various regulations targeting emissions, including rules and standards governing emissions from certain stationary sources and from vehicles.Any of these pending or proposed laws or regulations could adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results by, among other things: (1) reducing coal-fired electricity generation due to mandated emission standards; (2) reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the United States; (3) increasing the Company's fuel, capital and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies; and (4) making it difficult for the Company's customers in the U.S. and Canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner (particularly in the absence of similar regulations in countries like India and China).  Any of these factors could reduce the amount of traffic the Company handles and have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  7Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART ICapacity constraints could have a negative impact on service and operating efficiency. CSXT may experience rail network difficulties related to: (i) increased passenger activities, including high-speed rail, in capacity-constrained areas, or (ii) regulatory changes impacting when CSXT can transport freight or service routes, which could have a negative effect on CSXT's operational fluidity, leading to deterioration of service, asset utilization and overall efficiency. General economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight. A  decline in general domestic and global economic conditions that affect demand for the commodities and products the Company transports could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects.  For example,  if the rate of economic growth in Asia slows or if European economies contract, U.S. export coal volume could be adversely impacted resulting in lower revenue for CSX.  In the event the Company experiences significant declines in demand for its transportation services with respect to one or more commodities and products, the Company may experience reduced revenue and increased operating costs associated with the storage of locomotives, rail cars and other equipment, workforce adjustments, and other related activities, which could have a material adverse effect on operations, financial condition and liquidity.     Changing dynamics in the U.S. energy markets could negatively impact freight volumes.Over the past few years, production of natural gas in the U.S. has increased dramatically, which resulted in lower natural gas prices causing a negative impact on CSX.  As a result of sustained low natural gas prices, coal-fired power plants have been displaced by natural gas-fired power generation facilities.  If natural gas prices remain low, additional coal-fired plants could be displaced, which could further reduce the Company's domestic coal volumes and revenues.  CSXT, as a common carrier by rail, is required by law to transport hazardous materials, which could expose the Company to significant costs and claims. Under federal regulations, CSXT is required to transport hazardous materials under its common carrier obligation.  A train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury, property or natural resource damage, environmental penalties and remediation obligations.  Such claims, if insured, could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates.  CSXT is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials.

The FRA is now re-examining certain aspects of the rule in response to rail industry concerns.  The AAR recently advised the FRA on behalf of the industry that a nationwide interoperable PTC network cannot be completed by the December 31, 2015 deadline.  Federal legislation introduced in both the House of Representatives and the Senate would, if approved, delay the final implementation of PTC from three to five years. Even if revised, the rule will continue to impose significant new costs on the Company and the rail industry.  Noncompliance with these and other applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the Company and can subject the Company to fines, penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions. Climate change legislation and regulation could adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results. Climate change legislation or regulation has been proposed and, in some cases adopted, on the federal, state, provincial (Canada) and local levels.  These final and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions, caps, taxes or other controls on greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions.  In particular, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has issued various regulations targeting GHG emissions, including rules and standards governing GHG emissions from certain stationary sources and from vehicles.Any of these pending or proposed laws or regulations could adversely affect CSX  operations and financial results by, among other things: (1) increasing energy costs generally, making it difficult for the Company's customers in the U.S. and Canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner (particularly in the absence of similar regulations in countries like India and China); (2) increasing the Company's fuel, capital and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies; (3) reducing coal-fired electricity generation due to mandated emission standards which CSX considers to be unachievable within the time frames ordered by the U.S. EPA, and (4) reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the United States.  Any of these factors could reduce the amount of traffic the Company handles and have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  7Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART ICapacity constraints could have a negative impact on service and operating efficiency. CSXT may experience rail network difficulties related to: (i) increased passenger activities, including high-speed rail, in capacity-constrained areas, or (ii) regulatory changes impacting when CSXT can transport freight or service routes that could have a negative effect on CSXT's operational fluidity, leading to deterioration of service, asset utilization and overall efficiency. General economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight. The economic recession in late 2008 and 2009 adversely affected demand for rail and intermodal services.  Although overall traffic improved in 2010 and 2011, a decline in general domestic and global economic conditions that affect demand for the commodities the Company carries could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects.  In addition, if the rate of economic growth in China slows or if European economies contract, U.S. export coal volume could be adversely impacted resulting in lower revenue for CSX.

         The followingrisk factors could have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s financialcondition, results of operations or liquidity, and could cause those results todiffer materially from those expressed or implied in the Company’sforward-looking statements.  Additional risks and uncertainties notcurrently known to the Company or that the Company currently does not deem to bematerial also may materially impact the Company’s financial condition, resultsof operations or liquidity.Newlegislation or regulatory changes could impact the Company’s earnings orrestrict its ability to independently negotiate prices.     Legislationpassed by Congress or new regulations issued by federal agencies cansignificantly affect the revenues, costs and profitability of the Company’sbusiness.  For instance, legislation proposed in the Senate inDecember 2009, and reintroduced in January 2011 (see Regulatory Environment inPart I for further details), if adopted, could significantly change the federalregulatory framework of the railroad industry.  Several of the changesunder consideration could have a significant negative impact on the Company’sability to determine prices for rail services, meet service standards and couldforce a reduction in capital spending.  Statutes imposing priceconstraints or affecting rail-to-rail competition could adversely affect theCompany’s profitability. 7Table of ContentsCSXCORPORATIONPARTI Governmentregulation and compliance risks may adversely affect the Company’s operationsand financial results.     The Companyis subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies, including theSTB, the FRA and other state and federal regulatory agencies for a variety ofeconomic, health, safety, labor, environmental, tax, legal and othermatters.  New rules or regulations by these agencies could increasethe Company’s operating costs or reduce operating efficiencies.  Forexample, the RSIA mandated the installation by December 31, 2015 of PositiveTrain Control (PTC) on main lines that carry certain hazardous materials and onlines that have commuter or passenger operations.  The FRA issued its finalrule in January 2010 on the design, operational requirements and implementationof the new technology.  The final rule is expected to impose significantnew costs on the Company and the rail industry.  Noncompliance withthese and other applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence inthe Company and can subject the Company to fines, penalties and other legal orregulatory sanctions.Climatechange legislation and regulation could adversely affect the Company’soperations and financial results.     Climatechange legislation or regulation has been proposed and, in some cases adopted,on the federal, state, provincial (Canada) and local levels.  Thesefinal and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions, caps,taxes or other controls on greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions.  Inparticular, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has issued variousregulations targeting GHG emissions, including rules and standards governing GHGemissions from certain stationary sources and from vehicles.     Any of thesepending or proposed laws or regulations could adversely affect CSX and itscustomers’ business, operations and financial results by, among otherthings: (1) increasing energy costs generally, making it difficult for theCompany’s customers in the U.S. and Canada to produce products in a costcompetitive manner (particularly in the absence of similar regulations incountries like India and China); (2) increasing the Company’s fuel and otheroperating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies; and(3) reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the UnitedStates.  Any of these factors could reduce the amount oftraffic the Company handles and have a material adverse effect on theCompany's financial condition, results of operations orliquidity.Capacityconstraints could have a negative impact on service and operatingefficiency.     CSXT mayexperience rail network difficulties related to: (i) increased passengeractivities, including high-speed rail, in capacity-constrained areas, or (ii)regulatory changes impacting when CSXTcan transport freight or service routes that could have a negative effect onCSXT’s operational fluidity, leading to deterioration of service, assetutilization and overall efficiency. 8Table of ContentsCSXCORPORATIONPARTIGeneraleconomic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and otherfreight.     The economicrecession adversely affected demand for rail and intermodal services. Although traffic improved in 2010, a decline in general domestic and global economicconditions that affect demand for the commodities the Company carries couldreduce revenues or have other adverse effects.  CSXT,as a common carrier by rail, is required by law to transport hazardousmaterials, which could expose the Company to significant costs andclaims.     Under federalregulations, CSXT is required to transport hazardous materials under its commoncarrier obligation.  A train accident involving the transport ofhazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personalinjury, property or natural resource damage, and environmental penalties andremediation obligations.  Such claims, if insured, could exceedexisting insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available atcommercially reasonable rates.  CSXT is also required to comply withregulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials.     In November2008, the TSA issued final rules placing significant new security and safetyrequirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers, rail transit systems,and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail.  Noncompliancewith these rules can subject the Company to significant penalties and could be afactor in litigation arising out of a train accident.  Finally,legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials

comply with these laws andregulations, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned byregulators.  We can also be held liable for consequences arising outof human exposure to any hazardous substances for which we areresponsible.  In certain circumstances, environmental liability canextend to formerly owned or operated properties, leased properties, adjacentproperties and properties owned by third

theCompany’s technology systems are critical to its ability to operate and competesafely and effectively.Disruptionof the supply chain could negatively affect operating efficiency and increasecosts.     The capitalintensive nature and sophistication of core rail equipment (including rollingstock equipment, locomotives, rail, and ties) limits the number of railroadequipment suppliers.  If any of the current manufacturers stopsproduction or experiences a supply shortage, CSXT could experience a significantcost increase or material shortage.  In addition, a few criticalrailroad suppliers are foreign and, as such, adverse developments ininternational relations, new trade regulations, disruptions in internationalshipping, or increases in global demand could make procurement of these suppliesmore difficult or increase CSXT’s operating costs.     Additionally,if a fuel supply shortage were to arise, whether due to the Organization of thePetroleum Exporting Countries or other production restrictions, lower refineryoutputs, a disruption of oil imports or otherwise, the Company would benegatively impacted. Failureto complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result instrikes and/or work stoppages.     Most ofCSXT's employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collectivebargaining agreements. Generally speaking, these agreements are bargainednationally by the National Carriers Conference Committee.  In the railindustry, negotiations have generally taken place over a number of years andpreviously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages.  If CSXTis unable to negotiate acceptable agreements, however, it could result instrikes by the affected workers, loss of business and increased operating costsas a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members.  Underthe Railway Labor Act’s procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periodsand the possibility of Presidential intervention), neither party may take actionuntil the procedures are exhausted. 10Table of ContentsCSXCORPORATIONPARTI TheCompany faces competition from other transportation providers.     The Companyexperiences competition in the form of pricing, service, reliability and otherfactors from various transportation providers including railroads and motorcarriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a lesssignificant extent, barges, ships and pipelines.

1,CSX,CSX CORP,2007-02-15,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
  The followingimportant risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the Companysforward-looking statements. Although the risks described below are those that management believes are the most significant, these are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that wecurrently do not deem to be material also may materially affect our business, financial condition or future results of operations.  Newlegislation or regulatory changes could increase the Companys cost of operations.  The Company is subject to variousregulatory jurisdictions, including the Surface Transportation Board (STB) of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), the Federal Railroad Administration of the DOT and other state and federal regulatoryagencies for a variety of economic, health, safety, labor, environmental, tax, legal and other matters. Legislation passed by Congress or regulations issued by these agencies can significantly affect the revenues, costs and profitability of theCompanys business. For example, additional regulations related to carbon dioxide could result in reduced coal production and higher expenses related to locomotive emissions, which would adversely affect the Companys income fromoperations. Moreover, the Company could be negatively affected by the cost to comply with applicable laws and regulations.  Inresponse to the heightened risk of terrorism, federal, state and local governmental bodies are proposing and beginning to adopt various legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry, such as theCustoms-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism. This voluntary initiative was designed to strengthen a portion of the supply chain for international shipments by requiring minimum security thresholds. Legislation, regulations, or rules enacted byfederal, state or local governmental bodies relating to security issues that affect rail and intermodal transportation could negatively impact the Company.  CSXT, as a common carrier by rail, is required to transport hazardous materials, which could expose the Company to significant costs and claims.  Under Federal regulations, CSXT is required to transport hazardous materials under its common carrier obligation. A rail accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significantclaims arising from personal injury, property damage, and environmental penalties and remediation.  General economic and geo-political risksmay affect the Companys operations.  Inflation or other changes in general economic conditions that affect demand forrail or intermodal services could adversely affect our results of operations. Abrupt political change or terrorist activity pose a risk of general economic disruption and could require changes in our operations and security arrangements, thusincreasing our operating costs. These conditions may lend additional uncertainty to the timing and purchasing decisions by our customers.  Furthermore, fuel prices and supply are influenced by international political and economic circumstances. Although a fuel surcharge recovery program is in place with a considerable number of customers, the Company could be negativelyimpacted if a fuel supply shortage were to arise, whether due to OPEC or other production restrictions, lower refinery outputs, a disruption of oil imports or otherwise.   6 Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATION  PART I   The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs. The Companys operations are subject to wide-ranging federal, state and local environmental laws and regulationsconcerning, among other things, emissions into the air, discharges into water, the handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials, and clean-up of hazardous material or petroleum releases. In certain circumstances,environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties, leased properties, adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or Company predecessors, as well as to properties currently owned and used by the Company. The Company has been, and may be subject to, allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated, or is strictly liableunder, environmental laws or regulations, and such violations can result in the Companys incurring fines, penalties or costs relating to the clean-up of environmental contamination. Although the Company believes it has appropriately recordedcurrent and long-term liabilities for known future environmental costs, it could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing, and may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown or futureenvironmental contamination.  Future acts of terrorism or war may cause significant disruptions in the Companys operations. Terrorist attacks, such as those that occurred in the United States in September 2001, in Spain in March 2004, in England inJuly 2005, and in India in July 2006, along with any government response to those attacks may adversely affect results of operations. CSXTs rail lines or other key infrastructure may be direct targets or indirect casualties of acts of terroror war. This could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. In addition, insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverage currently maintained by the Company couldincrease dramatically or the coverage may no longer be available.  Increases in the number and magnitude of property damage and personal injuryclaims could adversely affect the Companys operating results.  The Company faces inherent business risk from exposure toproperty damage, occupational injury claims, and personal injury claims resulting from train accidents, worker injury claims under FELA, and claims from outside parties resulting from the Companys operations. Although the Company isworking diligently to enhance its safety programs and to continue to raise the awareness levels of its employees concerning safety, the Company could experience material property damage or personal injury or occupational claims in the future and itmay incur significant costs to defend such claims.  Existing claims may suffer adverse developments not currently reflected inreserve estimates, as the ultimate outcome of existing claims is subject to numerous factors outside of the Companys control. The Company establishes reserves to cover all claims. However, final amounts determined to be due on any outstandingmatters may differ materially from the recorded reserves.  Network difficulties could have a negative impact on the Companys rail andintermodal operational efficiency.  CSXT cannot be sure that it will not experience rail network difficulties related tonetwork capacity, dramatic and unplanned increases in demand for rail service, or increased passenger activities in capacity-constrained areas that could have a negative impact on the Companys operational fluidity.  7 Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATION  PART I   Also, the Company may face external factors such as severe weather conditions and other naturaloccurrences, including floods, fires, hurricanes and earthquakes, which may disrupt the Companys operations. For information about the effects of Hurricane Katrina on the Companys results of operations, financial condition and liquidity,see Note 5, Hurricane Katrina.  The Company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures. The Company is subject to various existing lawsuits and potential, future, unknown litigation. The Company may experiencematerial judgments or incur significant costs to defend any such lawsuits. Additionally, existing litigation may suffer adverse development not currently reflected in its reserve estimates as the ultimate outcome of existing litigation is subject tonumerous factors outside of the Companys control. While the Company uses its best efforts to evaluate existing litigation, the final judgments may differ materially from the recorded reserves.  The limited availability of qualified personnel could adversely affect the Companys operations.  Changes in demographics, training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel, could each have a negative impact on CSXTsability to meet demand for rail service. In addition, approximately 27% of the Companys workforce will be eligible for retirement within the next five years. Increases in demand for qualified personnel and unexpected increases in demand forrail services may aggravate these risks.  Failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes, workstoppages.  Most of CSXTs employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements.Generally speaking, these agreements are bargained nationally by the National Carriers Committee. In the rail industry, negotiations have generally taken place over a number of years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages.Over the last 30 years, there were only six days of work stoppage related to labor disputes over national handling. A negotiating process for new collective bargaining agreements started with the issuance of bargaining notices in November 2004 andthe outcome of the current round of negotiations is uncertain at this time. The existing agreements will continue to remain in effect until new agreements are reached. Under the Railway Labor Acts procedures (which include mediation,cooling-off periods, and the possibility of Presidential intervention), neither party may exercise self-help until the procedures are exhausted.   "
