2,ALX,ALEXANDER'S INC,2024-02-12,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSMaterial factors that may adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition are summarized below.  The risks and uncertainties described herein may not be the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition. See “Forward-Looking Statements” contained herein on page 4.RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONSWe may be adversely affected by trends in office real estate, including work from home trends.In 2023, approximately 54% of our rental revenue was from Bloomberg, the office tenant at our 731 Lexington Avenue office property. Work from home, flexible or hybrid work schedules, open workplaces, videoconferencing, and teleconferencing remain prevalent in certain situations, following the COVID-19 pandemic. Changes in tenant space utilization, including from the continuation of work from home and flexible work arrangement policies, may cause office tenants to reassess their long-term physical space needs, which could have an adverse effect on our business. All of our properties are in New York City and are affected by the economic cycles and risks inherent to this area.All of our revenues come from properties located in New York City. Real estate markets are affected by economic downturns and we cannot predict how economic conditions will impact this market in either the short or long term. Declines in the economy and declines in the real estate markets in New York City have affected and could affect our financial performance and the value of our properties. In addition to the factors affecting the national economic condition generally, the factors affecting economic conditions in this area include:•financial performance and productivity of the media, advertising, professional services, financial, technology, retail, insurance and real estate industries;•business layoffs or downsizing;•any oversupply of, or reduced demand for, real estate;•industry slowdowns;•the effects of inflation; •rising interest rates;•relocations of businesses;•changing demographics;•increased work from home and use of alternative work places;•changes in the number of domestic and international tourists to our markets (including as a result of changes in the relative strengths of world currencies);•the fiscal health of New York State and New York City governments and local transit authorities; •quality of life conditions;•infrastructure quality;•increased government regulation and costs of complying with such regulations; and•changes in rates or the treatment of the deductibility of state and local taxes.It is impossible for us to predict the future effects of trends in the economic and investment climates of the New York City metropolitan region, and more generally of the United States, on the real estate market in this area. Local, national or global economic downturns could negatively affect the value of our properties, our business and profitability.We are subject to risks that affect the general and New York City retail environments.Certain of our properties are New York City retail properties and thus are affected by the general and New York City retail environments, including the level of consumer spending and consumer confidence, New York City tourism, office and residential occupancy rates, employer remote-working policies, the threat of terrorism or other criminal acts, increasing competition from online retailers and other retail centers, and the impact of technological change upon the retail environment generally. These factors could adversely affect the financial condition of our retail tenants, or result in the bankruptcy of such tenants, and the willingness of retailers to lease space in our retail locations, which could have an adverse effect on the value of our properties, our business and profitability.8Our performance and the value of an investment in us are subject to risks associated with our real estate assets and with the real estate industry.The value of our real estate and the value of an investment in us fluctuates depending on conditions in the general economy and the real estate business. These conditions may also adversely affect our revenues and cash flows.The factors that affect the value of our real estate include, among other things:•global, national, regional and local economic conditions and geopolitical events;•competition from other available space, including co-working space and subleases;•local conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area;•how well we manage our properties;•the development and/or redevelopment of our properties;•changes in market rental rates;•increased competition from online shopping and its impact on retail tenants and their demand for retail space;•the timing and costs associated with property improvements and rentals;•whether we are able to pass all or portions of any increases in operating costs through to tenants;•changes in real estate taxes and other expenses;•the ability of state and local governments to operate within their budgets;•whether tenants and users such as customers and shoppers consider a property attractive;•changes in consumer preferences adversely affecting retailers and retail store values;•changes in tenant space utilization;•the financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies or defaults;•consequences of any armed conflict involving, or terrorist attacks against, the United States or individual acts of violence in public spaces;•trends in office real estate, including many tenants’ preferences for space in modern amenitized buildings which may require the landlord to incur significant capital expenditures;•availability of financing on acceptable terms or at all;•inflation or deflation;•fluctuations in interest rates;•our ability to obtain adequate insurance;•government regulation, including changes in fiscal policies, taxation, and zoning laws;•potential liability and compliance costs associated with environmental or other laws or regulations;•natural disasters;•general competitive factors;•climate change; and•the impact of pandemics or outbreaks of other infectious diseases. The rents or sales proceeds we receive and the occupancy levels at our properties may decline as a result of adverse changes in any of these factors. If rental revenues, sales proceeds and/or occupancy levels decline, we generally would expect to have less cash available for operating costs, to pay indebtedness and for distribution to our stockholders. In addition, some of our major expenses, including mortgage interest payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs generally do not decline when the related rents decline, and maintenance costs can increase substantially in an inflationary environment. These factors may cause the value of our real estate assets to decline, which may result in non-cash impairment charges and the impact could be material.Real estate is a competitive business and that competition may adversely affect us.We compete with a large number of real estate investors, property owners and developers, some of whom may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments. Principal factors of competition are rents charged, tenant concessions offered, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and the quality of services provided.  Substantially all of our properties face competition from similar properties in the same market, which may adversely affect the rents we can charge at those properties and our results of operations. 9We may be unable to renew leases, lease vacant space or relet space as leases expire on favorable terms.When our tenants decide not to renew their leases upon their expiration, we may not be able to relet the space. Even if tenants do renew or we can relet the space, the terms of renewal or reletting, considering among other things, rent and concessions, the cost of improvements to the property and leasing commissions, may be on less economically favorable terms. In addition, changes in space utilization by our tenants may impact our ability to renew or relet space without the need to incur substantial costs in renovating or redesigning the internal configuration of the relevant property and/or space. If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the space at similar rates, lease vacant space, or if we are otherwise not able to maintain occupancy on favorable terms, our cash flow and ability to service debt obligations and pay dividends and distributions to stockholders could be adversely affected. 731 Lexington Avenue accounts for a majority of our revenues. Loss of or damage to the building would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.731 Lexington Avenue accounted for revenue of $148,806,000, $138,778,000 and $140,524,000 in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, representing approximately 66%, 67% and 68% of our rental revenues in each year, respectively. Loss of or damage to the building in excess of our insurance coverage, including as a result of a terrorist attack, would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Bloomberg represents a majority of our revenues. Loss of Bloomberg as a tenant or deterioration in Bloomberg’s credit quality could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Bloomberg accounted for revenue of $120,351,000, $115,129,000 and $113,140,000 in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, representing approximately 54%, 56% and 55% of our rental revenues in each year, respectively. No other tenant accounted for more than 10% of our rental revenues. If we were to lose Bloomberg as a tenant, or if Bloomberg were to be unable to fulfill its obligations under its lease, it would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We depend upon anchor tenants to attract shoppers at our Rego Park I and II retail properties and decisions made by these tenants, or adverse developments in the businesses of these tenants, could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our Rego Park I and II retail properties are anchored by well-known department stores and other tenants who generate shopping traffic. The value of these properties would be adversely affected if our anchor tenants failed to meet their contractual obligations, sought concessions in order to continue operations or ceased their operations, including as a result of bankruptcy.  If the level of sales at stores operating in our properties were to decline significantly due to economic conditions, increased competition from online shopping, closing of anchors or for other reasons, tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. In the event of a default by a tenant or anchor, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord. Additionally, closure of an anchor or major tenant could result in lease terminations by, or reductions of rent from other tenants if the other tenants’ leases have co-tenancy clauses. Bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants may decrease our revenues, net income and available cash.From time-to-time, some of our tenants have declared bankruptcy, and other tenants may declare bankruptcy, become insolvent or experience a material business downturn adversely affecting their ability to make timely rental payments in the future. If a tenant does not pay its rent, we may face delays enforcing our rights as landlord and may incur substantial legal and other costs. Even if we are able to enforce our rights, a tenant may not have recoverable assets. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant may delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude collection of these amounts altogether. As a result, the bankruptcy or insolvency of, or nonpayment by, a major tenant could cause us to suffer lower revenues and operational difficulties, including leasing the remainder of the property, which could in turn result in decreased net income and funds available to pay our indebtedness and make distributions to stockholders.10Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows have been and may continue to be adversely affected by outbreaks of highly infectious or contagious diseases.Our business has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the economic and industry challenges created by highly infectious or contagious diseases, including the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic caused retailers to reduce the number and size of their physical locations and further increase reliance on e-commerce, and future infectious or contagious diseases could have a similar impact. Additionally, our office tenant may adjust its employee work from home arrangements which may lead to a reassessment of its long-term physical space needs. Any future outbreak of a highly infectious or contagious disease could impact how people live, work and travel in ways that have affected and may in the future affect our properties. Over time, these factors could decrease the demand for office and retail space and ultimately decrease occupancy and/or rent levels across our portfolio, which may have a negative impact on our financial condition and/or access to capital.Some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance.We maintain general liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and per property, of which the first $30,000,000 includes communicable disease coverage, and all-risk property and rental value insurance coverage with limits of $1.7 billion per occurrence, including coverage for acts of terrorism, with sub-limits for certain perils such as floods and earthquakes on each of our properties and excluding communicable disease coverage.Fifty Ninth Street Insurance Company, LLC (“FNSIC”), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism, including nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) acts, as defined by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended to date and which has been extended through December 2027. Coverage for acts of terrorism (including NBCR acts) is up to $1.7 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate. Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to FNSIC. For NBCR acts, FNSIC is responsible for a $316,000 deductible and 20% of the balance of a covered loss, and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining 80% of a covered loss. We are ultimately responsible for any loss incurred by FNSIC.We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism or other events. However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future. We are responsible for uninsured losses and for deductibles and losses in excess of our insurance coverage, which could be material and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our loans contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. If lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain, it could adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance our properties.Actual or threatened terrorist attacks or other criminal acts may adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to generate cash flow.All of our properties are located in New York City, and our most significant property, 731 Lexington Avenue, is located on Lexington Avenue and 59th Street in Manhattan. In response to a terrorist attack, the perceived threat of terrorism or other criminal acts, tenants in this area may choose to relocate their businesses to less populated, lower-profile areas of the United States that may be perceived to be less likely targets of future terrorist activity or have lower rates of crime and fewer customers may choose to patronize businesses in this area. This, in turn, could trigger a decrease in the demand for space in this area, which could increase vacancies in our properties and force us to lease space at our properties on less favorable terms. Furthermore, we may experience increased costs for security, equipment and personnel. As a result, the value of our properties and the level of our revenues and cash flows could decline materially.11Natural disasters and the effects of climate change could have a concentrated impact on the area where we operate and could adversely affect our results.Our properties are located in New York City. Physical climate change and natural disasters, including earthquakes, storms, storm surges, tornados, floods and hurricanes, could cause significant damage to our properties and the surrounding environment or area. Potentially adverse consequences of climate change, including rising sea levels and increased temperature fluctuations, could similarly have an impact on our properties and the economies of the metropolitan area in which we operate. Government efforts to combat climate change may impact the cost of operating our properties. Over time, these conditions could result in declining demand for space in our buildings or the inability of us to operate the buildings at all. Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) property insurance on terms we find acceptable, increasing the cost of energy at our properties and requiring us to expend funds as we seek to repair and protect our properties against such risks. The incurrence of these losses, costs or business interruptions may adversely affect our operating and financial results.Our properties are located in an urban area, which means the vitality of our properties is reliant on sound transportation and utility infrastructure. If that infrastructure is compromised in any way by an extreme weather event, such a compromise could have an adverse effect on our local economies and populations, as well as on our tenants’ ability to do business in our buildings. Our properties are subject to transitional risks related to climate-related policy change. De-carbonization of grid-supplied energy could lead to increased energy costs and operating expenses for our buildings. Retrofitting our building systems to consume less energy could lead to increased capital costs. Buildings which consume fossil fuels onsite may be subject to penalties in the future. In addition, the full transition of grid-supplied energy to renewable sources (as has been mandated by the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act in New York State) could lead to increased energy costs and operating expenses for our buildings. Although these laws and regulations have not had any material adverse effects on our business to date, they could result in substantial costs, including compliance costs, increased energy costs, retrofit costs and construction costs. We cannot predict how future laws and regulations, or future interpretations of current laws and regulations, related to climate change will affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.We may become subject to costs, taxes or penalties, or increases therein, associated with natural resource or energy usage, such as a “carbon tax” and by local legislation such as New York City’s Local Law 97, which sets limits on carbon emissions in our buildings and imposes penalties if we exceed those limits, and New York City’s Intro 2317, or the “gas ban” bill, which limits any onsite fossil fuel combustion in new construction and major renovations. These costs, taxes or penalties could increase our operating costs and decrease the cash available to pay our indebtedness and make distributions to our stockholders.Changes to tax laws could affect REITs generally, the trading of our shares and our results of operations, both positively and negatively, in ways that are difficult to anticipate.The rules dealing with U.S. federal, state and local income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the Treasury Department. Changes to tax laws (which changes may have retroactive application) could adversely affect the taxation of REITs and their shareholders. We cannot predict whether, when, in what form, or with what effective dates, tax laws, regulations and rulings may be enacted, promulgated or decided, or technical corrections made, which could result in an increase in our, or our stockholders’, tax liability or require changes in the manner in which we operate in order to minimize increases in our tax liability. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income and/or be subject to additional restrictions. These increased tax costs could, among other things, adversely affect the trading price for our common shares, our financial condition, our results of operations and the amount of cash available to pay our indebtedness and make distributions to our stockholders.12Significant inflation and continuing increases in the inflation rate could adversely affect our business and financial results.Recent substantial increases in the rate of inflation and potential future elevated rates of inflation, both real and anticipated, may impact our business and results of operations. In a highly inflationary environment, we may be unable to raise rental rates at or above the rate of inflation, which could reduce our profit margins. In addition, our cost of labor and materials could increase, which could have an adverse effect on our business or financial results. Increased inflation could also adversely affect us by increasing costs of construction and renovation. While increases in most operating expenses at our properties can be passed on to our office and retail tenants, some tenants have fixed reimbursement charges, and expenses at our residential property may not be able to be passed on to residential tenants. Unreimbursed increased operating expenses may reduce cash flow available to pay our indebtedness and make distributions to our stockholders.We may acquire, develop, or redevelop properties and this may create risks.Although our current business strategy is not to engage in acquisitions, we may acquire, develop or redevelop properties when we believe that an acquisition, development or redevelopment project is otherwise consistent with our business strategy.  We may not succeed in (i) acquiring, developing, or redeveloping properties; (ii) completing these activities on time or within budget; and (iii) leasing or selling acquired, developed, or redeveloped properties at amounts sufficient to cover our costs.  Competition in these activities could also significantly increase our costs. Difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert management’s attention. Acquisitions, developments or redevelopments in new markets or types of properties where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in weaker than anticipated performance. We may also abandon acquisition, development or redevelopment opportunities that we have begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred. Furthermore, we may be exposed to the liabilities of properties acquired, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition.We are exposed to risks associated with property development, redevelopment and repositioning that could adversely affect us, including our financial condition and results of operations.We continue to engage in development, redevelopment and repositioning activities with respect to our properties. We are subject to certain risks in connection with development and redevelopment activities, which could adversely affect us, including our financial condition and results of operations. These risks include, without limitation, (i) the availability and pricing of financing on favorable terms or at all; (ii) the availability and timely receipt of zoning and other regulatory approvals; (iii) cost overruns, especially in an inflationary environment, and untimely completion of construction (including risks beyond our control, such as weather or labor conditions, material shortages or supply chain delays); (iv) the potential for the fluctuation of occupancy rates and rents at redeveloped properties, which may result in our investment not being profitable; (v) start up, repositioning and redevelopment costs may be higher than anticipated; (vi) the potential that we may fail to recover expenses already incurred if we abandon development or redevelopment opportunities after we begin to explore them; (vii) the potential that we may expend funds on and devote management’s time to projects which we do not complete; (viii) the inability to complete leasing of a property on schedule or at all, resulting in an increase in carrying or redevelopment costs; (ix) the possibility that properties will be leased at below expected rental rates. These risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses and could prevent the initiation or the completion of redevelopment activities or reduce the ultimate rents achieved on new developments. These outcomes could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, the market value of our common shares and ability to pay our indebtedness and make distributions to our stockholders.It may be difficult to sell real estate on a timely basis, which may limit our flexibility.Real estate investments are relatively illiquid. Consequently, we may have limited ability to dispose of assets in our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions which could have an adverse effect on our sources of working capital and our ability to satisfy our indebtedness.13RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS AND ACCESS TO CAPITALSignificantly tighter capital markets and economic conditions can materially affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations as well as the value of an investment in our common stock.There are many factors that can affect the value of our equity securities and any debt securities we may issue in the future, including the state of the capital markets and the economy. Demand for office and retail space typically declines nationwide due to an economic downturn, bankruptcies, downsizing, layoffs and cost cutting. Government action or inaction may adversely affect the state of the capital markets. The cost and availability of credit may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads, which may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including our results of operations, and the liquidity and financial condition of our tenants. Recently, domestic and international financial markets have experienced unusual volatility, significant interest rate increases and continuing uncertainty. Liquidity has significantly tightened in overall financial markets. Consequently, there is greater uncertainty regarding our ability to access the credit markets in order to obtain financing on reasonable terms. Additionally, the recent inflation environment has led to an increase in interest rates, which has had a direct and material increase on the interest expense of our borrowings. Our inability or the inability of our tenants to timely refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs may materially affect our financial condition and results of operations and the value of our common stock. We have outstanding debt, and the amount of debt and its cost may continue to increase and refinancing may not be available on acceptable terms, which could affect our future operations.As of December 31, 2023, total mortgages payable, excluding deferred debt issuance costs, was $1,096,544,000, and our rate of total debt to total enterprise value was 66%. “Enterprise value” means the market equity value of our common stock, plus debt, less cash and cash equivalents at such date. We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet our required debt service. Our debt service costs generally will not be reduced if conditions in the market or at our properties, such as the entry of new competitors or the loss of major tenants, cause a reduction in the income from our properties. Should such events occur, our operations may be adversely affected.If a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from such property is insufficient to pay that indebtedness, the property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of the asset.If we are unable to obtain additional debt financing or refinance existing indebtedness upon maturity, our financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely affected. In addition, the current rising interest rate environment has led to an increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt and an increase in the cost of refinancing our existing debt, entering into new debt and for interest rate hedge instruments, reducing our operating cash flows. While certain of our debt is fixed by an interest rate swap arrangement, the arrangement expires earlier than the mortgage loan maturity, resulting in future exposure to rising interest rates, which could further reduce our available cash. If the cost or amount of our indebtedness continues to increase or we cannot refinance our debt in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms, we are at risk of default on our obligations that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Our existing financing documents contain covenants and restrictions that may restrict our operational and financial flexibility.As of December 31, 2023, we had outstanding mortgage indebtedness of $1,096,544,000, secured by three of our properties. These mortgages contain covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness on these properties, provide for lender approval of tenants’ leases in certain circumstances, and in certain cases provide for yield maintenance or defeasance premiums to prepay them. These mortgages may significantly restrict our operational and financial flexibility. In addition, if we were to fail to perform our obligations under existing indebtedness or become insolvent or were liquidated, secured creditors would be entitled to payment in full from the proceeds of the sale of the pledged assets prior to any proceeds being paid to other creditors or to any holders of our securities.  In such an event, it is possible that we would have insufficient assets remaining to make payments to other creditors or to any holders of our securities. The hedge instruments we may use to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility involve risks.The interest rate hedge instruments we may use to manage some of our exposure to interest rate volatility involve risks, including the risk that counterparties may fail to perform under these arrangements. If interest rates were to fall, these arrangements may cause us to pay higher interest on our debt obligations than would otherwise be the case. In addition, the use of such instruments may generate income that may not be treated as qualifying REIT income for purposes of the 75% gross income test or 95% gross income test. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that our hedging arrangements will qualify as “highly effective” cash flow hedges under applicable accounting standards. If our hedges do not qualify as “highly effective,” the changes in the fair value of these instruments would be reflected in our results of operations and could adversely affect our earnings.14RISKS RELATED TO OUR ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURESubstantially all of our assets are owned by subsidiaries. We depend on dividends and distributions from these subsidiaries. The creditors of these subsidiaries are entitled to amounts payable to them by the subsidiaries before the subsidiaries may pay any dividends or make distributions to us.Substantially all of our properties and assets are held through our subsidiaries. We depend on cash distributions and dividends from our subsidiaries for substantially all of our cash flow. The creditors of each of our subsidiaries are entitled to payment of that subsidiary’s obligations to them when due and payable before that subsidiary may pay dividends or make distributions to us. Thus, our ability to pay dividends, if any, to our security holders depends on our subsidiaries’ ability to first satisfy their obligations to their creditors and our ability to satisfy our obligations, if any, to our creditors.In addition, our participation in any distribution of the assets of any of our subsidiaries upon the liquidation, reorganization or insolvency of the subsidiary, is only after the claims of the creditors, including trade creditors, and preferred security holders, if any, of the applicable subsidiary, are satisfied. Alexander’s charter documents and applicable laws may hinder any attempt to acquire us.Provisions in Alexander’s certificate of incorporation and by laws, as well as provisions of the Code and Delaware corporate law, may delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or a tender offer, even if such action might be beneficial to stockholders, and limit the stockholders’ opportunity to receive a potential premium for their shares of common stock over then prevailing market prices.In order to qualify as a REIT, five or fewer individuals, as defined in the Code, may not own, actually or constructively, more than 50% in value of the issued and outstanding shares of our stock at any time during the last half of each taxable year. Additionally, at least 100 persons must beneficially own shares of our stock during at least 335 days of a taxable year for each taxable year. To help ensure that we meet these tests, among other purposes, our charter restricts the acquisition and ownership of shares of our stock. Primarily to facilitate maintenance of its qualification as a REIT, Alexander’s certificate of incorporation generally prohibits ownership, directly, indirectly or beneficially, by any single stockholder of more than 9.9% of the outstanding shares of preferred stock of any class or 4.9% of outstanding common stock of any class. The Board of Directors may waive or modify these ownership limits with respect to one or more persons if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of these limits will not jeopardize Alexander’s status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. In addition, the Board of Directors has, subject to certain conditions and limitations, exempted Vornado and certain of its affiliates from these ownership limitations.  Stock owned in violation of these ownership limits will be subject to the loss of rights and other restrictions. These ownership limits may have the effect of inhibiting or impeding a change in control.Alexander’s Board of Directors is divided into three classes of directors. Directors of each class are chosen for three-year staggered terms.  Staggered terms of directors may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management, even though changes in management or a change in control might be in the best interest of our stockholders.In addition, Alexander’s charter documents authorize the Board of Directors to:•cause Alexander’s to issue additional authorized but unissued common stock or preferred stock;•classify or reclassify, in one or more series, any unissued preferred stock; and•set the preferences, rights and other terms of any classified or reclassified stock that Alexander’s issues.The Board of Directors could establish a series of preferred stock with terms that could delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Alexander’s or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our   stockholders, although the Board of Directors does not, at present, intend to establish a series of preferred stock of this kind.  Alexander’s charter documents contain other provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of the Company or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders.In addition, Vornado, Interstate and its three general partners (each of whom are both trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexander’s) together beneficially own approximately 58.4% of our outstanding shares of common stock.  This degree of ownership is likely to reduce the possibility of a tender offer or an attempt to change control of the Company by a third party.We may change our policies without obtaining the approval of our stockholders.Our operating and financial policies, including our policies with respect to acquisitions of real estate or other assets, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and dividends, are exclusively determined by our Board of Directors.  Accordingly, our stockholders do not control these policies.15Steven Roth, Vornado and Interstate may exercise substantial influence over us. They and some of our other directors and officers have interests or positions in other entities that may compete with us.As of December 31, 2023, Interstate and its partners owned approximately 7.0% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and approximately 26.0% of our outstanding common stock. Steven Roth, David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr. are the partners of Interstate. Mr. Roth is the Chairman of our Board of Directors and our Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado and the Managing General Partner of Interstate. Mr. Wight and Mr. Mandelbaum are both trustees of Vornado and members of our Board of Directors. In addition, Vornado manages and leases the real estate assets of Interstate. As of December 31, 2023, Vornado owned 32.4% of our outstanding common stock, in addition to the 26.0% owned by Interstate and its partners. In addition to the relationships described in the immediately preceding paragraph, Ms. Mandakini Puri is a trustee of Vornado and a member of our Board of Directors.Additionally, personnel and services that we require are provided to us under contracts with Vornado. We depend on Vornado to manage our operations and to acquire and manage our portfolio of real estate assets. Vornado makes all decisions regarding the day-to-day management of our company, subject to the supervision of, and any guidelines established by, our Board of Directors. Because of their overlapping interests, Vornado, Mr. Roth, Interstate and the other individuals noted in the preceding paragraphs may have substantial influence over Alexander’s, and on the outcome of any matters submitted to Alexander’s stockholders for approval.  In addition, certain decisions concerning our operations or financial structure may present conflicts of interest among Vornado, Messrs. Roth, Mandelbaum and Wight and Interstate and other security holders. Vornado, Mr. Roth and Interstate may, in the future, engage in a wide variety of activities in the real estate business which may result in conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting us, such as, which of these entities or persons, if any, may take advantage of potential business opportunities, the business focus of these entities, the types of properties and geographic locations in which these entities make investments, potential competition between business activities conducted, or sought to be conducted, by us, competition for properties and tenants, possible corporate transactions such as acquisitions, and other strategic decisions affecting the future of these entities.There may be conflicts of interest between Vornado, its affiliates and us.Vornado manages, develops and leases our properties under agreements that have one-year terms expiring in March of each year, which are automatically renewable. Because we share common senior management with Vornado and because four of the trustees of Vornado are on our Board of Directors, the terms of the foregoing agreements and any future agreements may not be comparable to those we could have negotiated with an unaffiliated third party.For a description of Interstate’s ownership of Vornado and Alexander’s see “Steven Roth, Vornado and Interstate may exercise substantial influence over us. They and some of our other directors and officers have interests or positions in other entities that may compete with us.” above. For a description of our related party transactions with Vornado, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Related Party Transactions.”16RISKS RELATED TO TECHNOLOGY, CYBERSECURITY AND DATA PROTECTION The occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in our cybersecurity, as well as other disruptions to our IT networks and related systems, could adversely affect our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information, and/or damage to our business relationships or reputation, all of which could adversely affect  our financial results.Our IT networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations (including managing our building systems) and, in some cases, may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants. We face risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the Internet, malware, ransomware, computer viruses, phishing, attachments to e-mails, persons who access our systems from inside or outside our organization, and other significant disruptions of our IT networks and related systems. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through a cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased, including through the use of artificial intelligence. Although we have not experienced cyber incidents that are individually, or in the aggregate, material, we have experienced cyber attacks in the past, which have thus far been mitigated by preventative, detective, and responsive measures that we have put in place. Although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Unauthorized parties, whether within or outside our company, may disrupt or gain access to our systems, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through human error, misfeasance, fraud, trickery, or other forms of deceit, including break-ins, use of stolen credentials, social engineering, phishing, computer viruses or other malicious codes, and similar means of unauthorized and destructive tampering. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed to not be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.A security breach or other significant disruption involving our IT networks and related systems could disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our tenants; result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or others, which others could use to compete against us or which could expose us to damage claims by third-parties for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; result in our inability to maintain the building systems relied upon by our tenants for the efficient use of their leased space; require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result; may require payments to the attackers; subject us to litigation claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, fines, penalties, governmental investigations and enforcement actions or termination of leases or other agreements; or damage our reputation among our tenants and investors generally. Any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.A cyber attack or systems failure could interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting requirements, which could adversely affect us. A cyber attack could also compromise the confidential information of our employees, tenants, customers and vendors. A successful attack could disrupt and materially affect our business operations, including damaging relationships with tenants, customers and vendors. Any compromise of our information security systems could also result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, loss or misuse of the information (which may be confidential, proprietary and/or commercially sensitive in nature) and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business.For additional information on our cybersecurity risk management process, see “Item 1C. Cybersecurity” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 17RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCKThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate.The trading price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate widely as a result of several factors, many of which are outside of our control. These factors include:•our financial condition and performance;•the financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies or defaults;•actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;•our dividend policy;•the reputation of REITs and real estate investments generally and the attractiveness of REIT equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate companies, and fixed income securities;•uncertainty and volatility in the equity and credit markets;•fluctuations in interest rates;•changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to our securities or those of other REITs;•failure to meet analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates;•speculation in the press or investment community;•strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;•the extent of institutional investor interest in us;•the extent of short-selling of our common stock and the shares of our competitors;•fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;•general financial and economic market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for office REITs and other real estate related companies and the New York City real estate market;•the impact of inflation;•local, domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance (including the macro-economic impact of geopolitical conflict);•fiscal policies or inaction at the U.S. federal government level that may lead to federal government shutdowns or negative impacts on the U.S. economy;•changes in tax laws and rules; and•all other risk factors addressed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.In addition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies. These broad market fluctuations have in the past and may in the future adversely affect the market price of our common stock. A significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for stockholders.Alexander’s has additional shares of its common stock available for future issuance, which could decrease the market price of the common stock currently outstanding.The interest of our current stockholders could be diluted if we issue additional equity securities. As of December 31, 2023, we had authorized but unissued 4,826,550 shares of common stock, par value of $1.00 per share and 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share; of which 23,388 shares of common stock are reserved for issuance upon redemption of the deferred stock units previously granted to our Board of Directors. In addition, 482,399 shares are available for future grant under the terms of our 2016 Omnibus Stock Plan. These awards may be granted in the form of options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, deferred stock units, or other equity-based interests, and if granted, would reduce that number of shares available for future grants, provided however that an award that may be settled only in cash, would not reduce the number of shares available under the plan. We cannot predict the impact that future issuances of common or preferred stock or any exercise of outstanding options or grants of additional equity-based interests would have on the market price of our common stock.Loss of our key personnel could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our common stock.We are dependent on the efforts of Steven Roth, the Chairman of our Board of Directors and our Chief Executive Officer. Although we believe that we could find a replacement, the loss of his services could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our common stock.18RISKS RELATED TO REGULATORY COMPLIANCEWe might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT, and may be required to pay federal income taxes at corporate rates, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock.Although we believe that we will remain organized and will continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we might fail to remain qualified. Qualification are governed by highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and depends on various facts and circumstances that are not entirely within our control. In addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the relevant tax laws and/or the federal income tax consequences of qualifying as a REIT. If, with respect to any taxable year, we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT and do not qualify under statutory relief provisions, we could not deduct distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would have to pay federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. The federal income tax payable would include any applicable alternative minimum tax. If we had to pay federal income tax, the amount of money available to distribute to stockholders and pay our indebtedness would be reduced for the year or years involved, and we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders in that taxable year and in future years until we were able to qualify as a REIT and did so. In addition, we would also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost, unless we were entitled to relief under the relevant statutory provisions. Our failure to qualify as a REIT could adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock.We may face possible adverse federal tax audits and changes in federal tax laws, which may result in an increase in our tax liability.In the normal course of business, certain entities through which we own real estate either have undergone or may undergo tax audits. Although we believe that we have substantial arguments in favor of our positions, in some instances there is no controlling precedent or interpretive guidance. There can be no assurance that audits will not occur with increased frequency or that the ultimate result of such audits will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. At any time, the U.S. federal income tax laws governing REITs or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended. We cannot predict if or when any new U.S. federal income tax law, regulation, or administrative interpretation, or any amendment to any existing U.S. federal income tax law, Treasury regulation or administrative interpretation, will be adopted, promulgated or become effective and any such law, regulation, or interpretation may take effect retroactively. Alexander’s, its taxable REIT subsidiaries, and our security holders could be adversely affected by any such change in, or any new, U.S. federal income tax law, Treasury regulation or administrative interpretation.We may face possible adverse state and local tax audits and changes in state and local tax law.Because we are organized and qualify as a REIT, we are generally not subject to federal income taxes, but we are subject to certain state and local taxes. In the normal course of business, certain entities through which we own real estate have undergone, tax audits. There can be no assurance that future audits will not occur with increased frequency or that the ultimate result of such audits will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.From time-to-time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. A shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we operate may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes in laws, regulations and administration of property and transfer taxes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available to pay our indebtedness and make distributions to our stockholders.Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs.The ADA generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, meet certain Federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the Federal government or the award of damages to private litigants and/or legal fees to their counsel. If, under the ADA, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the amount of cash available for distribution to stockholders.Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. We do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations.19We may incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and environmental contamination may impair our ability to lease and/or sell real estate.Our operations and properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment, including air and water quality, hazardous or toxic substances and health and safety. Under some environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances released at a property. The owner or operator may also be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage or personal injuries and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by those parties because of the contamination. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the release of the substances or caused the release. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may also impair our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. Other laws and regulations govern indoor and outdoor air quality including those that can require the abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials in the event of damage, demolition, renovation or remodeling and govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air. The maintenance and removal of lead paint and certain electrical equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are also regulated by federal and state laws. We are also subject to risks associated with human exposure to chemical or biological contaminants such as molds, pollens, viruses and bacteria which, above certain levels, can be alleged to be connected to allergic or other health effects and symptoms in susceptible individuals. We could incur fines for environmental compliance and be held liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to the foregoing regulated substances or related claims arising out of environmental contamination or human exposure to contamination at or from our properties.Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment. To date, these environmental assessments have not revealed any environmental condition material to our business. However, identification of new compliance concerns or undiscovered areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, human exposure to contamination or changes in clean-up or compliance requirements could result in significant costs to us"
1,ALX,ALEXANDER'S INC,2023-02-13,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSMaterial factors that may adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition are summarized below.  The risks and uncertainties described herein may not be the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition. See “Forward-Looking Statements” contained herein on page 4.RISKS RELATED TO OUR PROPERTIES AND INDUSTRYWe may be adversely affected by trends in office real estate, including work from home trends.In 2022, approximately 56% of our rental revenue was from Bloomberg, the office tenant at our 731 Lexington Avenue office property. Work from home, flexible or hybrid work schedules, open workplaces, videoconferencing, and teleconferencing are becoming more common, particularly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Changes in tenant space utilization, including increased acceptance of work from home and flexible work arrangement policies, may cause office tenants to reassess their long-term physical space needs, which could have an adverse effect on our business. All of our properties are in New York City and are affected by the economic cycles and risks inherent in that area.All of our revenues come from properties located in New York City. Real estate markets are subject to economic downturns and we cannot predict how economic conditions will impact this market in either the short or long term. Declines in the economy or declines in the real estate markets in New York City, including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,  have hurt and could continue to hurt our financial performance and the value of our properties. In addition to the factors affecting the national economic condition generally, the factors affecting economic conditions in this area include: •financial performance and productivity of the media, advertising, professional services, financial, technology, retail, insurance and real estate industries;•business layoffs or downsizing;•any oversupply of, or reduced demand for, real estate;•industry slowdowns;•the effects of inflation;•relocations of businesses;•changing demographics;•increased work from home and use of alternative work places;•changes in the number of domestic and international tourists to our markets (including as a result of changes in the relative strengths of world currencies and the COVID-19 pandemic);•the fiscal health of New York State and New York City governments and local transit authorities, particularly as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; •quality of life conditions;•infrastructure quality;•increased government regulation and costs of complying with such regulations; and•changes in rates or the treatment of the deductibility of state and local taxes.It is impossible for us to predict the future or the effect of trends in the economic and investment climates of the New York City metropolitan region, and more generally of the United States, on the real estate market in this area. Local, national or global economic downturns could negatively affect the value of properties, our business and profitability.We are subject to risks that affect the general and New York City retail environments.Certain of our properties are New York City retail properties and thus are affected by the general and New York City retail environments, including office and residential occupancy rates, the level of consumer spending and consumer confidence, New York City tourism, employer remote-working policies, the threat of terrorism or other criminal acts, increasing competition from on-line retailers and other retail centers, and the impact of technological change upon the retail environment generally. Furthermore, New York City tourism has not yet fully recovered from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. These factors could adversely affect the financial condition of our retail tenants, or result in the bankruptcy of such tenants, and the willingness of retailers to lease space in our retail locations, which could have an adverse effect on the value of our properties, our business and profitability.8Our performance and the value of an investment in us are subject to risks associated with our real estate assets and with the real estate industry.The value of our real estate and the value of an investment in us fluctuates depending on conditions in the general economy and the real estate business. These conditions may also adversely affect our revenues and cash flows. The factors that affect the value of our real estate include, among other things:•global, national, regional and local economic conditions;•competition from other available space, including co-working space and sub-leases;•local conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area;•how well we manage our properties;•the development and/or redevelopment of our properties;•changes in market rental rates;•increased competition from online shopping and its impact on retail tenants and their demand for retail space;•the timing and costs associated with property improvements and rentals;•whether we are able to pass all or portions of any increases in operating costs through to tenants;•changes in real estate taxes and other expenses;•the ability of state and local governments to operate within their budgets;•whether tenants and users such as customers and shoppers consider a property attractive;•changes in consumer preferences adversely affecting retailers and retail store values;•changes in tenant space utilization;•the financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies or defaults;•consequences of any armed conflict involving, or terrorist attacks against, the United States or individual acts of violence in public spaces;•trends in office real estate, including many tenants’ preferences for space in modern amenitized buildings which may require the landlord to incur significant capital expenditures;•availability of financing on acceptable terms or at all;•inflation or deflation;•fluctuations in interest rates;•our ability to obtain adequate insurance;•changes in zoning laws and taxation;•government regulation;•potential liability under environmental or other laws or regulations;•natural disasters;•general competitive factors;•climate change; and•the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or outbreaks of other highly infectious diseases. The rents or sales proceeds we receive and the occupancy levels at our properties may decline as a result of adverse changes in any of these factors. If rental revenues, sales proceeds and/or occupancy levels decline, we generally would expect to have less cash available for operating costs, to pay indebtedness and for distribution to our stockholders. In addition, some of our major expenses, including mortgage interest payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs generally do not decline when the related rents decline, and maintenance costs can increase substantially in an inflationary environment. These factors may cause the value of our real estate assets to decline, which may result in non-cash impairment charges and the impact could be material.Real estate is a competitive business and that competition may adversely affect us.We compete with a large number of real estate investors, property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments. Principal factors of competition are rents charged, sales prices, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and the quality of services provided.  Substantially all of our properties face competition from similar properties in the same market, which may adversely affect the rents we can charge at those properties and our results of operations. 9We depend on leasing space to tenants on economically favorable terms and collecting rent from tenants who may not be able to pay.Our financial results depend significantly on leasing space in our properties to tenants on economically favorable terms.  In addition, because a majority of our income is derived from renting real property, our income, and funds available to pay indebtedness and for distributions to stockholders will decrease if certain of our tenants cannot pay their rent or if we are not able to maintain our occupancy levels on favorable terms. If a tenant does not pay its rent, we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial legal and other costs. Even if we are able to enforce our rights, a tenant may not have recoverable assets. We may be unable to renew leases or relet space as leases expire.When our tenants decide not to renew their leases upon their expiration, we may not be able to relet the space. Even if tenants do renew or we can relet the space, the terms of renewal or reletting, considering among other things, rent and other concessions, the cost of improvements to the property and leasing commissions, may be less favorable than the terms in the expired leases. In addition, changes in space utilization by our tenants may impact our ability to renew or relet space without the need to incur substantial costs in renovating or redesigning the internal configuration of the relevant property and/or space. If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the space at similar rates or if we incur substantial costs in renewing or reletting the space, our cash flow and ability to service debt obligations and pay dividends and distributions to stockholders could be adversely affected. 731 Lexington Avenue accounts for a substantial portion of our revenues. Loss of or damage to the building would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.731 Lexington Avenue accounted for revenue of $138,778,000, $140,524,000 and $137,718,000 in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, representing approximately 67%, 68% and 69% of our rental revenues in each year, respectively. Loss of or damage to the building in excess of our insurance coverage, including as a result of a terrorist attack, would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Bloomberg represents a significant portion of our revenues. Loss of Bloomberg as a tenant or deterioration in Bloomberg’s credit quality could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Bloomberg accounted for revenue of  $115,129,000, $113,140,000 and $109,066,000 in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, representing approximately 56%, 55% and 55% of our rental revenues in each year, respectively. No other tenant accounted for more than 10% of our rental revenues. If we were to lose Bloomberg as a tenant, or if Bloomberg were to be unable to fulfill its obligations under its lease, it would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We depend upon anchor tenants to attract shoppers at our Rego Park I and II retail properties and decisions made by these tenants, or adverse developments in the businesses of these tenants, could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our Rego Park I and II retail properties are anchored by well-known department stores and other tenants who generate shopping traffic. The value of these properties would be adversely affected if our anchor tenants failed to meet their contractual obligations, sought concessions in order to continue operations or ceased their operations, including as a result of bankruptcy.  If the level of sales of stores operating in our properties were to decline significantly due to economic conditions, increased competition from on-line shopping, closing of anchors or for other reasons, tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. In the event of a default by a tenant or anchor, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord. Additionally, closure of an anchor or major tenant could result in lease terminations by, or reductions of rent from, other tenants if the other tenants’ leases have co-tenancy clauses. On December 3, 2022, IKEA closed its 112,000 square foot anchor store at Rego Park I. IKEA remains obligated under its lease which expires in December 2030. The lease includes a right to terminate effective no earlier than March 2026, subject to payment of rent through the termination date and an additional termination payment equal to the lesser of $10,000,000 or the amount of rent due under the remaining term.Bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants may decrease our revenues, net income and available cash.From time-to-time, some of our tenants have declared bankruptcy, and other tenants may declare bankruptcy or become insolvent in the future. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant could cause us to suffer lower revenues and operational difficulties, including leasing the remainder of the property. As a result, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant or multiple tenants could result in decreased revenues, net income and funds available to pay our indebtedness or make distributions to stockholders.10Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, or future outbreaks of other highly infectious diseases, and the impact could be material to us.Our business has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the economic and industry challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic and preventive measures taken to curb the spread of the virus. While substantially all of the limitations and restrictions imposed during the onset of the pandemic have been lifted and/or eased and people have largely resumed pre-pandemic activities, economic conditions continue to negatively impact the financial health of our retail tenants. The impact of such conditions could cause retailers to reduce the number and size of their physical locations and further increase reliance on e-commerce. Additionally, our office tenant may see further delay in employee return-to-work plans as a result of the continued risks of the pandemic and further dependence on work from home and flexible work arrangements may lead our office tenant to reassess its long-term physical space needs. Additionally, if the COVID-19 virus or another more contagious variant were to spread, governmental agencies and other authorities may reorder closures or reimpose restrictions on businesses, which could further negatively impact the financial condition of our tenants. Over time, these factors could decrease the demand for office and retail space and ultimately decrease occupancy and/or rent levels across our portfolio, which may have a negative impact on our financial condition and/or access to capital. There is no guarantee that the jurisdictions in which we operate will not reimpose restrictions in an effort to mitigate risks to public health. We may continue to experience material impacts to our business, financial condition, and operating results due to the COVID-19 pandemic or variants or future outbreaks of other highly infectious diseases and those impacts may have the effect of heightening other risks described under this heading “Risk Factors
.”Some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance.We maintain general liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and per property, of which the first $30,000,000 includes communicable disease coverage, and all-risk property and rental value insurance coverage with limits of $1.7 billion per occurrence, including coverage for acts of terrorism, with sub-limits for certain perils such as floods and earthquakes on each of our properties and excluding communicable disease coverage.Fifty Ninth Street Insurance Company, LLC (“FNSIC”), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism, including nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) acts, as defined by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended to date and which has been extended through December 2027. Coverage for acts of terrorism (including NBCR acts) is up to $1.7 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate. Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to FNSIC. For NBCR acts, FNSIC is responsible for a $298,000 deductible and 20% of the balance of a covered loss, and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining 80% of a covered loss. We are ultimately responsible for any loss incurred by FNSIC.We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism or other events. However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future. We are responsible for uninsured losses and for deductibles and losses in excess of our insurance coverage, which could be material and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.The principal amounts of our mortgage loans are non-recourse to us and the loans contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. If lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain, it could adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance our properties.Actual or threatened terrorist attacks may adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to generate cash flow.All of our properties are located in New York City, and our most significant property, 731 Lexington Avenue, is located on Lexington Avenue and 59th Street in Manhattan. In response to a terrorist attack, the perceived threat of terrorism or other criminal acts, tenants in this area may choose to relocate their businesses to less populated, lower-profile areas of the United States that may be perceived to be less likely targets of future terrorist activity or have lower rates of crime and fewer customers may choose to patronize businesses in this area. This, in turn, could trigger a decrease in the demand for space in these areas, which could increase vacancies in our properties and force us to lease our properties on less favorable terms. Furthermore, we may experience increased costs for security, equipment and personnel. As a result, the value of our properties and the level of our revenues and cash flows could decline materially.11Natural disasters and the effects of climate change could have a concentrated impact on the area which we operate and could adversely affect our results.Our investments are in New York City. Natural disasters, including earthquakes, storms, tornados, floods and hurricanes, could cause significant damage to our properties and the surrounding environment or area. Potentially adverse consequences of “global warming,” including rising sea levels, could similarly have an impact on our properties and the economies of the metropolitan area in which we operate. Government efforts to combat climate change may impact the cost of operating our properties. Over time, these conditions could result in declining demand for space in our buildings or the inability of us to operate the buildings at all. Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) property insurance on terms we find acceptable, increasing the cost of energy at our properties and requiring us to expend funds as we seek to repair and protect our properties against such risks. The incurrence of these losses, costs or business interruptions may adversely affect our operating and financial results.Our properties are located in urban areas, which means the vitality of our properties is reliant on sound transportation and utility infrastructure. If that infrastructure is compromised in any way by an extreme weather event, such a compromise could have an adverse effect on our local economies and populations, as well as on our tenants’ ability to do business in our buildings. Our properties are subject to transitional risks related to climate-related policy change. De-carbonization of grid-supplied energy could lead to increased energy costs and operating expenses for our buildings. Retrofitting our building systems to consume less energy could lead to increased capital costs. Buildings which consume fossil fuels onsite may be subject to penalties. In addition, the full transition of grid-supplied energy to renewable sources (as has been mandated by the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act in New York State) could lead to increased energy costs and operating expenses for our buildings.We may also become subject to costs, taxes or penalties, or increases therein, associated with natural resource or energy usage, such as a “carbon tax” and by local legislation such as New York City’s Local Law 97, which sets limits on carbon emissions in our buildings and imposes penalties if we exceed those limits, and New York City’s Intro 2317, or the “gas ban” bill, which limits any onsite fossil fuel combustion in new construction and major renovations. These costs, taxes or penalties could increase our operating costs and decrease the cash available to pay our indebtedness or make distributions to our stockholders.Changes to tax laws could affect REITs generally, the trading of our shares and our results of operations, both positively and negatively, in ways that are difficult to anticipate.The rules dealing with U.S. federal, state and local income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the Treasury Department. Changes to tax laws (which changes may have retroactive application) could adversely affect the taxation of REITs and their shareholders. We cannot predict whether, when, in what form, or with what effective dates, tax laws, regulations and rulings may be enacted, promulgated or decided, or technical corrections made, which could result in an increase in our, or our stockholders’, tax liability or require changes in the manner in which we operate in order to minimize increases in our tax liability. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income and/or be subject to additional restrictions. These increased tax costs could, among other things, adversely affect the trading price for our common shares, our financial condition, our results of operations and the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends.12RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS AND STRATEGIESSignificant inflation and continuing increases in the inflation rate could adversely affect our business and financial results.Recent substantial increases in the rate of inflation and potential future elevated rates of inflation, both real and anticipated, may impact our investments and results of operations. In a highly inflationary environment, we may be unable to raise rental rates at or above the rate of inflation, which could reduce our profit margins. In addition, our cost of labor and materials could increase, which could have an adverse effect on our business or financial results. Increased inflation could also adversely affect us by increasing costs of construction and renovation. While increases in most operating expenses at our properties can be passed on to our office and retail tenants, some tenants have fixed reimbursement charges and expenses at our residential property may not be able to be passed on to residential tenants. Unreimbursed increased operating expenses may reduce cash flow available to pay our indebtedness or make distributions to our stockholders.We may acquire, develop, or redevelop properties and this may create risks.Although our stated business strategy is not to engage in acquisitions, we may acquire, develop or redevelop properties when we believe that an acquisition, development or redevelopment project is otherwise consistent with our business strategy.  We may not succeed in (i) developing, redeveloping or acquiring properties; (ii) completing these activities on time or within budget; and (iii) leasing or selling developed, redeveloped or acquired properties at amounts sufficient to cover our costs.  Competition in these activities could also significantly increase our costs. Difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert management’s attention. Acquisitions, developments or redevelopments in new markets or types of properties where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in weaker than anticipated performance. We may also abandon acquisition, development or redevelopment opportunities that we have begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred. Furthermore, we may be exposed to the liabilities of properties acquired, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition. We are exposed to risks associated with property development, redevelopment and repositioning that could adversely affect us, including our financial condition and results of operations.We continue to engage in development, redevelopment and repositioning activities with respect to our properties. We are subject to certain risks in connection with development and redevelopment activities, which could adversely affect us, including our financial condition and results of operations. These risks include, without limitation, (i) the availability and pricing of financing on favorable terms or at all; (ii) the availability and timely receipt of zoning and other regulatory approvals; (iii) increased costs of construction and any cost overruns, especially in an inflationary environment, and untimely completion of construction (including risks beyond our control, such as weather or labor conditions, material shortages or supply chain delays); (iv) the potential for the fluctuation of occupancy rates and rents at redeveloped properties, which may result in our investment not being profitable; (v) start up, repositioning and redevelopment costs may be higher than anticipated; (vi) the potential that we may fail to recover expenses already incurred if we abandon development or redevelopment opportunities after we begin to explore them; (vii) the potential that we may expend funds on and devote management time to projects which we do not complete; (viii) the inability to complete leasing of a property on schedule or at all, resulting in an increase in carrying or redevelopment costs; (ix) the possibility that properties will be leased at below expected rental rates and (x) to the extent the redevelopment activities are conducted in partnership with third parties, the possibility of disputes with our joint venture development partners and the potential that we miss certain project milestone deadlines. These risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses and could prevent the initiation or the completion of redevelopment activities or the ultimate rents achieved on new developments, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, the market value of our common shares and ability to pay our indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders.It may be difficult to sell real estate on a timely basis, which may limit our flexibility.Real estate investments are relatively illiquid. Consequently, we may have limited ability to dispose of assets in our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions which could have an adverse effect on our sources of working capital and our ability to satisfy our indebtedness.13RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS AND ACCESS TO CAPITALCapital markets and economic conditions can materially affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations as well as the value of an investment in our common stock.There are many factors that can affect the value of our equity securities and any debt securities we may issue in the future, including the state of the capital markets and economy. Demand for office and retail space typically declines nationwide due to an economic downturn, bankruptcies, downsizing, layoffs and cost cutting. Government action or inaction may adversely affect the state of the capital markets. The cost and availability of credit may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads, which may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including our results of operations, and the liquidity and financial condition of our tenants. Our inability or the inability of our tenants to timely refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs may materially affect our financial condition and results of operations and the value of our common stock. We have outstanding debt, and the amount of debt and its cost may increase and refinancing may not be available on acceptable terms.As of December 31, 2022, total debt outstanding was $1,096,544,000, excluding deferred financing costs, and our ratio of total debt to total enterprise value was 54%. “Enterprise value” means the market equity value of our common stock, plus debt, less cash and cash equivalents at such date. In addition, we have significant debt service obligations. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our total cash payments for principal and interest was $25,934,000.  In the future, we may incur additional debt, and thus increase the ratio of total debt to total enterprise value. If our level of indebtedness increases, there may be an increased risk of default which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in a rising interest rate environment, the cost of refinancing our existing debt and any new debt or market rate security or instrument may increase. Continued uncertainty in the equity and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms or at all, which may negatively affect our ability to refinance our debt.We have a substantial amount of indebtedness that could affect our future operations.As of December 31, 2022, total debt outstanding was $1,096,544,000, excluding deferred financing costs. We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service. Our debt service costs generally will not be reduced if developments in the market or at our properties, such as the entry of new competitors or the loss of major tenants, cause a reduction in the income from our properties. Should such events occur, our operations may be adversely affected. If a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from such property is insufficient to pay that indebtedness, the property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value.Substantially all of our assets are owned by subsidiaries. We depend on dividends and distributions from these subsidiaries. The creditors of these subsidiaries are entitled to amounts payable to them by the subsidiaries before the subsidiaries may pay any dividends or distributions to us.Substantially all of our properties and assets are held through our subsidiaries. We depend on cash distributions and dividends from our subsidiaries for substantially all of our cash flow. The creditors of each of our direct and indirect subsidiaries are entitled to payment of that subsidiary’s obligations to them when due and payable before that subsidiary may make distributions or dividends to us. Thus, our ability to pay dividends, if any, to our security holders depends on our subsidiaries’ ability to first satisfy their obligations to their creditors and our ability to satisfy our obligations, if any, to our creditors.In addition, our participation in any distribution of the assets of any of our direct or indirect subsidiaries upon the liquidation, reorganization or insolvency of the subsidiary, is only after the claims of the creditors, including trade creditors, and preferred security holders, if any, of the applicable direct or indirect subsidiaries are satisfied. 14Our existing financing documents contain covenants and restrictions that may restrict our operational and financial flexibility.As of December 31, 2022, we had outstanding mortgage indebtedness of $1,096,544,000, secured by three of our properties. These mortgages contain covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness on these properties, provide for lender approval of tenants’ leases in certain circumstances, and in certain cases provide for yield maintenance or defeasance premiums to prepay them. These mortgages may significantly restrict our operational and financial flexibility. In addition, if we were to fail to perform our obligations under existing indebtedness or become insolvent or were liquidated, secured creditors would be entitled to payment in full from the proceeds of the sale of the pledged assets prior to any proceeds being paid to other creditors or to any holders of our securities.  In such an event, it is possible that we would have insufficient assets remaining to make payments to other creditors or to any holders of our securities. The hedge instruments we may use to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility involve risks.The interest rate hedge instruments we may use to manage some of our exposure to interest rate volatility involve risks, including the risk that counterparties may fail to perform under these arrangements. If interest rates were to fall, these arrangements may cause us to pay higher interest on our debt obligations than would otherwise be the case. In addition, the use of such instruments may generate income that may not be treated as qualifying REIT income for purposes of the 75% gross income test or 95% gross income test. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that our hedging arrangements will qualify as “highly effective” cash flow hedges under applicable accounting standards. If our hedges do not qualify as “highly effective,” the changes in the fair value of these instruments would be reflected in our results of operations and could adversely affect our earnings.We may be adversely affected by the discontinuation of London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”).On March 5, 2021, the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) announced that USD LIBOR will no longer be published after June 30, 2023. The Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) has been identified by market participants as the preferred alternative to USD LIBOR in derivatives and other financial contracts. Our new floating rate loans entered into after December 31, 2021 will no longer reference LIBOR and will reference SOFR or another floating rate.As of December 31, 2022, we had variable debt indexed to LIBOR of $500,000,000, subject to an interest rate cap arrangement that caps LIBOR at a rate of 6.00% through June 2023. The transition of our LIBOR-based obligations to SOFR could affect all-in interest rates on our debt and interest rate swap and cap arrangements and could result in interest payable that does not correlate over time with the interest rates and/or payments that would have been made on our obligations if LIBOR was available in its current form.  15RISKS RELATED TO OUR ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTUREAlexander’s charter documents and applicable law may hinder any attempt to acquire us.Provisions in Alexander’s certificate of incorporation and by laws, as well as provisions of the Code and Delaware corporate law, may delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or a tender offer, even if such action might be beneficial to stockholders, and limit the stockholders’ opportunity to receive a potential premium for their shares of common stock over then prevailing market prices.In order to qualify as a REIT, five or fewer individuals, as defined in the Code, may not own, actually or constructively, more than 50% in value of the issued and outstanding shares of our stock at any time during the last half of each taxable year. Additionally, at least 100 persons must beneficially own shares of our stock during at least 335 days of a taxable year for each taxable year. To help ensure that we meet these tests, among other purposes, our charter restricts the acquisition and ownership of shares of our stock. Primarily to facilitate maintenance of its qualification as a REIT, Alexander’s certificate of incorporation generally prohibits ownership, directly, indirectly or beneficially, by any single stockholder of more than 9.9% of the outstanding shares of preferred stock of any class or 4.9% of outstanding common stock of any class.  The Board of Directors may waive or modify these ownership limits with respect to one or more persons if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of these limits will not jeopardize Alexander’s status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.  In addition, the Board of Directors has, subject to certain conditions and limitations, exempted Vornado and certain of its affiliates from these ownership limitations.  Stock owned in violation of these ownership limits will be subject to the loss of rights and other restrictions.  These ownership limits may have the effect of inhibiting or impeding a change in control.Alexander’s Board of Directors is divided into three classes of directors.  Directors of each class are chosen for three-year staggered terms.  Staggered terms of directors may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management, even though changes in management or a change in control might be in the best interest of our stockholders.In addition, Alexander’s charter documents authorize the Board of Directors to:•cause Alexander’s to issue additional authorized but unissued common stock or preferred stock;•classify or reclassify, in one or more series, any unissued preferred stock; and•set the preferences, rights and other terms of any classified or reclassified stock that Alexander’s issues. The Board of Directors could establish a series of preferred stock with terms that could delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Alexander’s or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our   stockholders, although the Board of Directors does not, at present, intend to establish a series of preferred stock of this kind.  Alexander’s charter documents contain other provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of the Company or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders.In addition, Vornado, Interstate and its three general partners (each of whom are both trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexander’s) together beneficially own approximately 58.4% of our outstanding shares of common stock.  This degree of ownership is likely to reduce the possibility of a tender offer or an attempt to change control of the Company by a third party.We may change our policies without obtaining the approval of our stockholders.Our operating and financial policies, including our policies with respect to acquisitions of real estate or other assets, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and dividends, are exclusively determined by our Board of Directors.  Accordingly, our stockholders do not control these policies.16Steven Roth, Vornado and Interstate may exercise substantial influence over us. They and some of our other directors and officers have interests or positions in other entities that may compete with us.As of December 31, 2022, Interstate and its partners owned approximately 7.0% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and approximately 26.0% of our outstanding common stock. Steven Roth, David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr. are the partners of Interstate. Mr. Roth is the Chairman of our Board of Directors and our Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado and the Managing General Partner of Interstate. Mr. Wight and Mr. Mandelbaum are both trustees of Vornado and members of our Board of Directors. In addition, Vornado manages and leases the real estate assets of Interstate. As of December 31, 2022, Vornado owned 32.4% of our outstanding common stock, in addition to the 26.0% owned by Interstate and its partners. In addition to the relationships described in the immediately preceding paragraph, Ms. Mandakini Puri is a trustee of Vornado and a member of our Board of Directors.Additionally, personnel and services that we require are provided to us under contracts with Vornado. We depend on Vornado to manage our operations and to acquire and manage our portfolio of real estate assets. Vornado makes all decisions regarding the day-to-day management of our company, subject to the supervision of, and any guidelines established by, our board of directors. Because of their overlapping interests, Vornado, Mr. Roth, Interstate and the other individuals noted in the preceding paragraphs may have substantial influence over Alexander’s, and on the outcome of any matters submitted to Alexander’s stockholders for approval.  In addition, certain decisions concerning our operations or financial structure may present conflicts of interest among Vornado, Messrs. Roth, Mandelbaum and Wight and Interstate and other security holders. Vornado, Mr. Roth and Interstate may, in the future, engage in a wide variety of activities in the real estate business which may result in conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting us, such as, which of these entities or persons, if any, may take advantage of potential business opportunities, the business focus of these entities, the types of properties and geographic locations in which these entities make investments, potential competition between business activities conducted, or sought to be conducted, by us, competition for properties and tenants, possible corporate transactions such as acquisitions, and other strategic decisions affecting the future of these entities.There may be conflicts of interest between Vornado, its affiliates and us.Vornado manages, develops and leases our properties under agreements that have one-year terms expiring in March of each year, which are automatically renewable. Because we share common senior management with Vornado and because four of the trustees of Vornado are on our Board of Directors, the terms of the foregoing agreements and any future agreements may not be comparable to those we could have negotiated with an unaffiliated third party. For a description of Interstate’s ownership of Vornado and Alexander’s, see “Steven Roth, Vornado and Interstate may exercise substantial influence over us. They and some of our other directors and officers have interests or positions in other entities that may compete with us.” above. For a description of our related party transactions with Vornado, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Related Party Transactions.”17 The occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in our cyber security, as well as other disruptions of our IT networks and related systems, could adversely affect our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information, and/or damage to our business relationships or reputation, all of which could adversely affect  our financial results.We face risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the Internet, malware, ransomware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons who access our systems from inside or outside our organization, and other significant disruptions of our IT networks and related systems. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Although we have not experienced cyber incidents that are individually, or in the aggregate, material, we have experienced cyber attacks in the past, which have thus far been mitigated by preventative, detective, and responsive measures that we have put in place. Our IT networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations (including managing our building systems) and, in some cases, may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants. Although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Unauthorized parties, whether within or outside our company, may disrupt or gain access to our systems, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through human error, misfeasance, fraud, trickery, or other forms of deceit, including break-ins, use of stolen credentials, social engineering, phishing, computer viruses or other malicious codes, and similar means of unauthorized and destructive tampering. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed to not be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.A security breach or other significant disruption involving our IT networks and related systems could disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our tenants; result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or others, which others could use to compete against us or which could expose us to damage claims by third-parties for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; result in our inability to maintain the building systems relied upon by our tenants for the efficient use of their leased space; require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result; may require payments to the attackers; subject us to litigation claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, fines, penalties, governmental investigations and enforcement actions or termination of leases or other agreements; or damage our reputation among our tenants and investors generally. Any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.A cyber attack or systems failure could interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting requirements, which could adversely affect us. A cyber attack could also compromise the confidential information of our employees, tenants, customers and vendors. A successful attack could disrupt and materially affect our business operations, including damaging relationships with tenants, customers and vendors. Any compromise of our information security systems could also result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, loss or misuse of the information (which may be confidential, proprietary and/or commercially sensitive in nature) and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business.18RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCKThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate.The trading price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate widely as a result of several factors, many of which are outside of our control.  In addition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies. These broad market fluctuations have in the past and may in the future adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In particular, the market price of our common shares has been further adversely impacted since March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the factors that could affect the price of our common stock are:•our financial condition and performance;•the financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies or defaults;•actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;•our dividend policy;•the reputation of REITs and real estate investments generally and the attractiveness of REIT equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate companies, and fixed income securities;•uncertainty and volatility in the equity and credit markets;•fluctuations in interest rates;•changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to our securities or those of other REITs;•failure to meet analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates;•speculation in the press or investment community;•strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;•the extent of institutional investor interest in us;•the extent of short-selling of our common stock and the shares of our competitors;•fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;•general financial and economic market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for office REITs and other real estate related companies and the New York City real estate market;•domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance (including the macro-economic impact of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine);•changes in tax laws and rules; and•all other risk factors addressed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.A significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for stockholders.Alexander’s has additional shares of its common stock available for future issuance, which could decrease the market price of the common stock currently outstanding.The interest of our current stockholders could be diluted if we issue additional equity securities. As of December 31, 2022, we had authorized but unissued 4,826,550 shares of common stock, par value of $1.00 per share and 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share; of which 19,796 shares of common stock are reserved for issuance upon redemption of the deferred stock units previously granted to our Board of Directors. In addition, 485,991 shares are available for future grant under the terms of our 2016 Omnibus Stock Plan. These awards may be granted in the form of options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, deferred stock units, or other equity-based interests, and if granted, would reduce that number of shares available for future grants, provided however that an award that may be settled only in cash, would not reduce the number of shares available under the plan. We cannot predict the impact that future issuances of common or preferred stock or any exercise of outstanding options or grants of additional equity-based interests would have on the market price of our common stock.Loss of our key personnel could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our common stock.We are dependent on the efforts of Steven Roth, our Chief Executive Officer. Although we believe that we could find a replacement, the loss of his services could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our common stock.19RISKS RELATED TO REGULATORY COMPLIANCEWe might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT, and may be required to pay federal income taxes at corporate rates.Although we believe that we will remain organized and will continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we might fail to remain qualified. Qualification are governed by highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and depends on various facts and circumstances that are not entirely within our control. In addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the relevant tax laws and/or the federal income tax consequences of qualifying as a REIT. If, with respect to any taxable year, we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT and do not qualify under statutory relief provisions, we could not deduct distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would have to pay federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. The federal income tax payable would include any applicable alternative minimum tax. If we had to pay federal income tax, the amount of money available to distribute to stockholders and pay our indebtedness would be reduced for the year or years involved, and we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders in that taxable year and in future years until it was able to qualify as a REIT and did so. In addition, we would also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost, unless we were entitled to relief under the relevant statutory provisions.We may face possible adverse changes in federal tax laws, which may result in an increase in our tax liability.In the normal course of business, certain entities through which we own real estate either have undergone or may undergo tax audits.  Although we believe that we have substantial arguments in favor of our positions, in some instances there is no controlling precedent or interpretive guidance.  There can be no assurance that audits will not occur with increased frequency or that the ultimate result of such audits will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. At any time, the U.S. federal income tax laws governing REITs or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended. We cannot predict if or when any new U.S. federal income tax law, regulation, or administrative interpretation, or any amendment to any existing U.S. federal income tax law, Treasury regulation or administrative interpretation, will be adopted, promulgated or become effective and any such law, regulation, or interpretation may take effect retroactively. Alexander’s, its taxable REIT subsidiaries, and our security holders could be adversely affected by any such change in, or any new, U.S. federal income tax law, Treasury regulation or administrative interpretation.We may face possible adverse state and local tax audits and changes in state and local tax law.Because we are organized and qualify as a REIT, we are generally not subject to federal income taxes, but we are subject to certain state and local taxes. In the normal course of business, certain entities through which we own real estate have undergone tax audits. There can be no assurance that future audits will not occur with increased frequency or that the ultimate result of such audits will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.From time-to-time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. A shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we operate may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for the payment of our indebtedness and make distributions to our stockholders.Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs.The ADA generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, meet certain Federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the Federal government or the award of damages to private litigants and/or legal fees to their counsel.  If, under the ADA, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the amount of cash available for distribution to stockholders.Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements.  If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards.  We do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations.20We may incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and environmental contamination may impair our ability to lease and/or sell real estate.Our operations and properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment, including air and water quality, hazardous or toxic substances and health and safety. Under some environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances released at a property. The owner or operator may also be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage or personal injuries and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by those parties because of the contamination. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the release of the substances or caused the release. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may also impair our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. Other laws and regulations govern indoor and outdoor air quality including those that can require the abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials in the event of damage, demolition, renovation or remodeling and govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air. The maintenance and removal of lead paint and certain electrical equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are also regulated by federal and state laws. We are also subject to risks associated with human exposure to chemical or biological contaminants such as molds, pollens, viruses and bacteria which, above certain levels, can be alleged to be connected to allergic or other health effects and symptoms in susceptible individuals. We could incur fines for environmental compliance and be held liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to the foregoing regulated substances or related claims arising out of environmental contamination or human exposure to contamination at or from our properties. Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment. To date, these environmental assessments have not revealed any environmental condition material to our business. However, identification of new compliance concerns or undiscovered areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, human exposure to contamination or changes in clean-up or compliance requirements could result in significant costs to us"
0,ALX,ALEXANDER'S INC,2022-02-14,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSMaterial factors that may adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition are summarized below.  The risks and uncertainties described herein may not be the only ones we face.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition. See “Forward-Looking Statements” contained herein on page 4.RISKS RELATED TO OUR PROPERTIES AND INDUSTRYOur business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact could be material to us.Our business has been adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and preventive measures taken to curb the spread of the virus. The pandemic has resulted in governments and other authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and business closures. Existing and potential new variants make the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic difficult to predict. If the virus continues to spread significantly in its current form or as a more contagious variant, governmental agencies and other authorities may order additional closures or impose further restrictions on businesses, which could negatively impact the financial condition of our tenants. The continuation of the pandemic could also have fundamental adverse effects on our business. Further delays in tenant return-to-work plans as a result of the continued risks of the pandemic and further dependence on work from home and flexible work arrangements may lead our office tenant to reassess its long-term physical space needs. Further, while many of the limitations and restrictions imposed on retailers during the onset of the pandemic have been lifted and/or eased, economic conditions, including a decline in New York City tourism since the onset of the virus, continue to adversely affect the financial health of our retail tenants. The impact of such conditions could cause retailers to reduce the number and size of their physical locations and further increase reliance on e-commerce. Over time, these factors could decrease the demand for office and retail space and ultimately decrease occupancy and/or rent levels across our portfolio, which may have a negative impact on our financial condition and/or access to capital. In addition, the value of our real estate assets may decline, which may result in non-cash impairment charges in future periods and the impact could be material. The extent of the COVID-19 pandemic’s effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including vaccination rates among the population, the efficacy and durability of vaccines against emerging variants and governmental and tenant responses thereto, all of which are uncertain at this time. Given the dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows but the impact could be material.All of our properties are in the New York City metropolitan area and are affected by the economic cycles and risks inherent in that area.All of our revenues come from properties located in the New York City metropolitan area. Real estate markets are subject to economic downturns and we cannot predict how economic conditions will impact this market in either the short or long term.  Recent declines in the economy and declines in the real estate market in this area, have hurt and could continue to hurt, our financial performance and the value of our properties.  In addition to the factors affecting the national economic condition generally, the factors affecting economic conditions in this area include: •financial performance and productivity of the media, advertising, professional services, financial, technology, retail, insurance and real estate industries;•the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;•business layoffs or downsizing;•industry slowdowns;•relocations of businesses;•changing demographics;•increased telecommuting and use of alternative work places;•changes in the number of domestic and international tourists to our markets (including as a result of changes in the relative strengths of world currencies);•infrastructure quality; •changes in the rates or treatment of the deductibility of state and local taxes; and•any oversupply of, or reduced demand for, real estate.It is impossible for us to predict the future or the effect of trends in the economic and investment climates of the New York City metropolitan region, and more generally of the United States, on the real estate market in this area.  Local, national or global economic downturns could negatively affect our business and profitability.7We may be adversely affected by trends in office real estate, including work from home trends.Trends in the working environment, including work from home, flexible or hybrid work schedules, open workplaces and teleconferencing are becoming more common and have accelerated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These practices enable businesses to reduce their office space requirements. There is also an increasing trend among some businesses to utilize shared office spaces and co-working spaces. A continuation of these trends could, over time, erode the overall demand for office space and, in turn, place downward pressure on occupancy, rental rates and property valuations.We are subject to risks that affect the general and New York City retail environments.Certain of our properties are New York City retail properties.  As such, these properties are affected by the general and New York City retail environments, including the level of consumer spending and consumer confidence, New York City tourism, which has not fully recovered from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, employer remote-working policies, the threat of terrorism, increasing competition from on-line retailers, other retailers and outlet malls and the impact of technological change upon the retail environment generally. For a number of our tenants that operate retail businesses involving high contact interactions with their customers, the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their business has been particularly severe and the recovery more difficult, with customer traffic down significantly. Furthermore, it is unknowable whether consumers’ retail habits will return to norms that existed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. These factors could adversely affect the financial condition of our retail tenants, or result in the bankruptcy of such tenants, and the willingness of retailers to lease space in our retail locations, which could have an adverse effect on our business and profitability. Terrorist attacks may adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to generate cash flow.All of our properties are located in the New York City metropolitan area, and our most significant property, 731 Lexington Avenue, is located on Lexington Avenue and 59th Street in Manhattan.  In response to a terrorist attack or the perceived threat of terrorism, tenants in this area may choose to relocate their businesses to less populated, lower-profile areas of the United States that may be perceived to be less likely targets of future terrorist activity and fewer customers may choose to patronize businesses in this area. This, in turn, could trigger a decrease in the demand for space in these markets, which could increase vacancies in our properties and force us to lease our properties on less favorable terms. Furthermore, we may experience increased costs for security, equipment and personnel.  As a result, the value of our properties and the level of our revenues could decline materially. Natural disasters and the effects of climate change could have a concentrated impact on the area which we operate and could adversely impact our results.Our investments are in the New York City metropolitan area and since they are concentrated along the Eastern Seaboard, natural disasters, including hurricanes, could cause significant damage to our properties and the surrounding environment or area.  Potentially adverse consequences of “global warming,” including rising sea levels, could similarly have an impact on our properties and the economy of the New York City metropolitan area in which we operate. Government efforts to combat climate change may impact the cost of operating our properties and real estate in the New York City metropolitan area.  Over time, these conditions could result in declining demand for office space in our buildings or the inability of us to operate the buildings at all. Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) property insurance on terms we find acceptable, increasing the cost of energy at our properties and requiring us to expend funds as we seek to repair and protect our properties against such risks. The incurrence of these losses, costs or business interruptions may adversely affect our operating and financial results.Our properties are located in urban areas, which means the vitality of our properties is reliant on sound transportation and utility infrastructure. If that infrastructure is compromised in any way by an extreme weather event, such a compromise could have an adverse impact on our local economies and populations, as well as on our tenants’ ability to do business in our buildings. 8Our properties are subject to transitional risks related to climate-related policy change. De-carbonization of grid-supplied energy could lead to increased energy costs and operating expenses for our buildings. Retrofitting our building systems to consume less energy could lead to increased capital costs. Buildings which consume fossil fuels onsite may be subject to penalties. In addition, the full transition of grid-supplied energy to renewable sources (as has been mandated by the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act in New York State) could lead to increased energy costs and operating expenses for our buildings.In addition, we may become subject to costs, taxes or penalties, or increases therein, associated with natural resource or energy usage, such as a “carbon tax” and by local legislation such as New York City’s Local Law 97, which sets limits on carbon emissions in our buildings and imposes penalties if we exceed those limits, and New York City’s Intro 2317, or the “gas ban” bill, which limits any onsite fossil fuel combustion in new construction and major renovations. These costs, taxes or penalties could increase our operating costs and decrease the cash available to pay our obligations or distribute to equity holders.U.S. federal tax legislation now and in the future could affect REITs generally, the trading of our shares and our results of operations, both positively and negatively, in ways that are difficult to anticipate.The rules dealing with U.S. federal, state and local income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department. Changes to tax laws (which changes may have retroactive application) could adversely affect our stockholders or us. In recent years, many such changes have been made, including under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which made major changes to the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), including a number of provisions of the Code that affect the taxation of REITs and their shareholders, and changes are likely to continue to occur in the future. We cannot predict whether, when, in what form, or with what effective dates, tax laws, regulations and rulings may be enacted, promulgated or decided, or technical corrections made, which could result in an increase in our, or our stockholders’, tax liability or require changes in the manner in which we operate in order to minimize increases in our tax liability. A shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we operate may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income and/or be subject to additional restrictions. These increased tax costs could, among other things, adversely affect our financial condition, the results of operations and the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends. Stockholders are urged to consult with their own tax advisors with respect to the impact that recent legislation may have on their investment and the status of legislative, regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on their investment in our shares.9Our performance and the value of an investment in us are subject to risks associated with our real estate assets and with the real estate industry.The value of our real estate and the value of an investment in us fluctuates depending on conditions in the general economy and the real estate business.  These conditions may also adversely impact our revenues and cash flows. The factors that affect the value of our real estate include, among other things: •global, national, regional and local economic conditions;•the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;•competition from other available space;•local conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area;•how well we manage our properties;•the development and/or redevelopment of our properties;•changes in market rental rates;•the timing and costs associated with property improvements and rentals;•whether we are able to pass all or portions of any increases in operating costs through to tenants;•political and regulatory conditions;•changes in real estate taxes and other expenses;  •the ability of state and local governments to operate within their budgets;•whether tenants and users such as customers and shoppers consider a property attractive;•changes in consumer preferences adversely affecting retailers and retail store values;•changes in space utilization by our tenants due to technology, economic conditions and business environment;•the financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies or defaults;•consequences of any armed conflict involving, or terrorist attack against, the United States or individual acts of                      violence in public spaces;•trends in office real estate;•the impact on our retail tenants and demand for retail space at our properties due to increased competition from online shopping;•availability of financing on acceptable terms or at all;•inflation or deflation;•fluctuations in interest rates;•our ability to obtain adequate insurance;•changes in zoning laws and taxation;•government regulation;•potential liability under environmental or other laws or regulations;•natural disasters;•general competitive factors; and•climate change. The rents we receive and the occupancy levels at our properties may decline as a result of adverse changes in any of these factors.  If our rental revenues and/or occupancy levels decline, we generally would expect to have less cash available for operating costs, to pay our indebtedness and for distribution to our stockholders.  In addition, some of our major expenses, including mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs generally do not decline when the related rents decline, and maintenance costs can increase substantially in an inflationary environment.Real estate is a competitive business and that competition may adversely impact us.We compete with a large number of property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments.  Principal factors of competition are rents charged, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and the quality of services provided.  Substantially all of our properties face competition from similar properties in the same market, which may adversely impact the rents we can charge at those properties and our results of operations. 10We depend on leasing space to tenants on economically favorable terms and collecting rent from tenants who may not be able to pay.Our financial results depend significantly on leasing space in our properties to tenants on economically favorable terms.  In addition, because a majority of our income is derived from renting real property, our income, funds available to pay indebtedness and for distributions to stockholders will decrease if certain of our tenants cannot pay their rent or if we are not able to maintain our occupancy levels on favorable terms.  If a tenant does not pay its rent, we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and might incur substantial legal and other costs. Even if we are able to enforce our rights, a tenant may not have recoverable assets. Additionally, in limited circumstances, we have agreed and may continue to agree to rent deferrals and abatements for certain of our tenants. Bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants may decrease our revenues, net income and available cash.From time to time, some of our tenants have declared bankruptcy, and other tenants may declare bankruptcy or become insolvent in the future. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant could cause us to suffer lower revenues and operational difficulties, including leasing the remainder of the property.  As a result, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant or multiple tenants could result in decreased revenues, net income and funds available to pay our indebtedness or make distributions to stockholders.We depend upon anchor tenants to attract shoppers at our Rego Park I and II retail properties and decisions made by these tenants, or adverse developments in the businesses of these tenants, could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our Rego Park I and II retail properties are anchored by well-known department stores and other tenants who generate shopping traffic.  The value of these properties would be adversely affected if our anchor tenants failed to meet their contractual obligations, sought concessions in order to continue operations or ceased their operations, including as a result of bankruptcy.  If the level of sales of stores operating in our properties were to decline significantly due to economic conditions, increased competition from online shopping, closing of anchors or for other reasons, tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges.  In the event of a default by a tenant or anchor, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord.  Additionally, closure of an anchor or major tenant could result in lease terminations by, or reductions of rent from, other tenants if the other tenants’ leases have co-tenancy clauses.We may be unable to renew leases or relet space as leases expire.When our tenants decide not to renew their leases upon their expiration, we may not be able to relet the space. Even if tenants do renew or we can relet the space, the terms of renewal or reletting, considering among other things, the cost of improvements to the property and leasing commissions, may be less favorable than the terms in the expired leases. In addition, changes in space utilization by our tenants may impact our ability to renew or relet space without the need to incur substantial costs in renovating or redesigning the internal configuration of the relevant property. If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the space at similar rates or if we incur substantial costs in renewing or reletting the space, our cash flow and ability to service debt obligations and pay dividends and distributions to stockholders could be adversely affected.  731 Lexington Avenue accounts for a substantial portion of our revenues. Loss of or damage to the building would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.731 Lexington Avenue accounted for revenue of $140,524,000, $137,718,000 and $153,797,000 in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, representing approximately 68%, 69% and 68% of our rental revenues in each year, respectively.  Loss of or damage to the building in excess of our insurance coverage, including as a result of a terrorist attack, would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Bloomberg represents a significant portion of our revenues.  Loss of Bloomberg as a tenant or deterioration in Bloomberg’s credit quality could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Bloomberg accounted for revenue of  $113,140,000, $109,066,000, and $109,113,000 in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, representing approximately 55%, 55% and 48% of our rental revenues in each year, respectively.  No other tenant accounted for more than 10% of our rental revenues.  If we were to lose Bloomberg as a tenant, or if Bloomberg were to be unable to fulfill its obligations under its lease, it would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.11RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS AND STRATEGIESWe may acquire, develop, or redevelop properties and this may create risks.Although our stated business strategy is not to engage in acquisitions, we may acquire, develop or redevelop properties when we believe that an acquisition, development or redevelopment project is otherwise consistent with our business strategy.  We may not succeed in (i) developing, redeveloping or acquiring properties; (ii) completing these activities on time or within budget; and (iii) leasing or selling developed, redeveloped or acquired properties at amounts sufficient to cover our costs.  Competition in these activities could also significantly increase our costs. Difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert management’s attention. Acquisitions, developments or redevelopments in new markets or types of properties where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in weaker than anticipated performance. We may also abandon acquisition, development or redevelopment opportunities that we have begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred.  Furthermore, we may be exposed to the liabilities of properties acquired, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition. We are exposed to risks associated with property development, redevelopment and repositioning that could adversely affect us, including our financial condition and results of operations.We continue to engage in development, redevelopment and repositioning activities with respect to our properties. Specifically, in 2021, we filed permits to construct an apartment tower at our Rego Park III property. We are subject to certain risks in connection with development and redevelopment activities, which could adversely affect us, including our financial condition and results of operations. These risks include, without limitation, (i) the availability and pricing of financing on favorable terms or at all; (ii) the availability and timely receipt of zoning and other regulatory approvals; (iii) the potential for the fluctuation of occupancy rates and rents at redeveloped properties, which may result in our investment not being profitable; (iv) start up, repositioning and redevelopment costs may be higher than anticipated; (v) cost overruns, especially in an inflationary environment, and untimely completion of construction (including risks beyond our control, such as weather or labor conditions, material shortages or supply chain delays); (vi) the potential that we may fail to recover expenses already incurred if we abandon development or redevelopment opportunities after we begin to explore them; (vii) the potential that we may expend funds on and devote management time to projects which we do not complete; (viii) the inability to lease a property on schedule or at all, resulting in increased construction or redevelopment costs; and (ix) the possibility that properties will be leased at below expected rental rates. These risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses and could prevent the initiation or the completion of redevelopment activities, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, the market value of our common stock and ability to satisfy our principal and interest obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders.It may be difficult to sell real estate timely, which may limit our flexibility.Real estate investments are relatively illiquid. Consequently, we may have limited ability to dispose of assets in our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions which could have an adverse effect on our sources of working capital and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations. Significant inflation could adversely affect our business and financial results.Increased inflation can adversely affect us by increasing costs of land, construction and renovation. In a highly inflationary environment, we may be unable to raise the rental rates at or above the rate of inflation, which could reduce our profit margins. In addition, our cost of labor and materials can increase, which could have an adverse impact on our business or financial results. While increases in most operating expenses at our commercial properties can be passed on to our office and retail tenants, increases in expenses at our residential properties may not be able to be passed on to residential tenants. An increase to unreimbursed operating expenses may reduce cash flow available for payment of mortgage debt and interest and for distributions to stockholders.12RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS AND ACCESS TO CAPITALSubstantially all of our assets are owned by subsidiaries.  We depend on dividends and distributions from these subsidiaries.  The creditors of these subsidiaries are entitled to amounts payable to them by the subsidiaries before the subsidiaries may pay any dividends or distributions to us.Substantially all of our properties and assets are held through our subsidiaries.  We depend on cash distributions and dividends from our subsidiaries for substantially all of our cash flow.  The creditors of each of our direct and indirect subsidiaries are entitled to payment of that subsidiary’s obligations to them when due and payable before that subsidiary may make distributions or dividends to us.  Thus, our ability to pay dividends, if any, to our security holders depends on our subsidiaries’ ability to first satisfy their obligations to their creditors and our ability to satisfy our obligations, if any, to our creditors. In addition, our participation in any distribution of the assets of any of our direct or indirect subsidiaries upon the liquidation, reorganization or insolvency of the subsidiary, is only after the claims of the creditors, including trade creditors, and preferred security holders, if any, of the applicable direct or indirect subsidiaries are satisfied. Our existing financing documents contain covenants and restrictions that may restrict our operational and financial flexibility.As of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding mortgage indebtedness of $1,096,544,000, secured by three of our properties.  These mortgages contain covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness on these properties, provide for lender approval of tenants’ leases in certain circumstances, and provide for yield maintenance or defeasance premiums to prepay them.  These mortgages may significantly restrict our operational and financial flexibility. In addition, if we were to fail to perform our obligations under existing indebtedness or become insolvent or were liquidated, secured creditors would be entitled to payment in full from the proceeds of the sale of the pledged assets prior to any proceeds being paid to other creditors or to any holders of our securities.  In such an event, it is possible that we would have insufficient assets remaining to make payments to other creditors or to any holders of our securities. We have a substantial amount of indebtedness that could affect our future operations.As of December 31, 2021, total debt outstanding was $1,096,544,000. We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service. Our debt service costs generally will not be reduced if developments in the market or at our properties, such as the entry of new competitors or the loss of major tenants, cause a reduction in the income from our properties. Should such events occur, our operations may be adversely affected. If a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from such property is insufficient to pay that indebtedness, the property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value. We have outstanding debt, and the amount of debt and its cost may increase and refinancing may not be available on acceptable terms.As of December 31, 2021, total debt outstanding was $1,096,544,000 and our ratio of total debt to total enterprise value was 56%.  “Enterprise value” means the market equity value of our common stock, plus debt, less cash and cash equivalents at such date.  In addition, we have significant debt service obligations.  For the year ended December 31, 2021, our cash payments for principal and interest were $86,568,000.  In the future, we may incur additional debt, and thus increase the ratio of total debt to total enterprise value.  If our level of indebtedness increases, there may be an increased risk of default which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, in a rising interest rate environment, the cost of refinancing our existing debt and any new debt or market rate security or instrument may increase.  Continued uncertainty in the equity and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms or at all, which may negatively affect our ability to refinance our debt.Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect results of operations.The interest rate hedge instruments we use to manage some of our exposure to interest rate volatility involve risk and counterparties may fail to perform under these arrangements. In addition, these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes and when existing interest rate hedges terminate, we may incur increased costs in implementing further interest rate hedges. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations.13RISKS RELATED TO OUR ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURELoss of our key personnel could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our common stock.We are dependent on the efforts of Steven Roth, our Chief Executive Officer.  Although we believe that we could find a replacement, the loss of his services could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our common stock.Alexander’s charter documents and applicable law may hinder any attempt to acquire us.Provisions in Alexander’s certificate of incorporation and by laws, as well as provisions of the Code and Delaware corporate law, may delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or a tender offer, even if such action might be beneficial to stockholders, and limit the stockholders’ opportunity to receive a potential premium for their shares of common stock over then prevailing market prices. Primarily to facilitate maintenance of its qualification as a REIT, Alexander’s certificate of incorporation generally prohibits ownership, directly, indirectly or beneficially, by any single stockholder of more than 9.9% of the outstanding shares of preferred stock of any class or 4.9% of outstanding common stock of any class.  The Board of Directors may waive or modify these ownership limits with respect to one or more persons if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of these limits will not jeopardize Alexander’s status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.  In addition, the Board of Directors has, subject to certain conditions and limitations, exempted Vornado and certain of its affiliates from these ownership limitations.  Stock owned in violation of these ownership limits will be subject to the loss of rights and other restrictions.  These ownership limits may have the effect of inhibiting or impeding a change in control. Alexander’s Board of Directors is divided into three classes of directors.  Directors of each class are chosen for three-year staggered terms.  Staggered terms of directors may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management, even though changes in management or a change in control might be in the best interest of our stockholders. In addition, Alexander’s charter documents authorize the Board of Directors to: •cause Alexander’s to issue additional authorized but unissued common stock or preferred stock;•classify or reclassify, in one or more series, any unissued preferred stock; and•set the preferences, rights and other terms of any classified or reclassified stock that Alexander’s issues. The Board of Directors could establish a series of preferred stock with terms that could delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Alexander’s or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our   stockholders, although the Board of Directors does not, at present, intend to establish a series of preferred stock of this kind.  Alexander’s charter documents contain other provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of the Company or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. In addition, Vornado, Interstate and its three general partners (each of whom are both trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexander’s) together beneficially own approximately 58.4% of our outstanding shares of common stock.  This degree of ownership is likely to reduce the possibility of a tender offer or an attempt to change control of the Company by a third party. We may change our policies without obtaining the approval of our stockholders.Our operating and financial policies, including our policies with respect to acquisitions of real estate or other assets, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and dividends, are exclusively determined by our Board of Directors.  Accordingly, our stockholders do not control these policies.14Steven Roth, Vornado and Interstate may exercise substantial influence over us.  They and some of our other directors and officers have interests or positions in other entities that may compete with us.As of December 31, 2021, Interstate and its partners owned approximately 6.9% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and approximately 26.0% of our outstanding common stock.  Steven Roth, David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr. are the partners of Interstate.  Mr. Roth is the Chairman of our Board of Directors and our Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado and the Managing General Partner of Interstate.  Mr. Wight and Mr. Mandelbaum are both trustees of Vornado and members of our Board of Directors.  In addition, Vornado manages and leases the real estate assets of Interstate. As of December 31, 2021, Vornado owned 32.4% of our outstanding common stock, in addition to the 26.0% owned by Interstate and its partners.  In addition to the relationships described in the immediately preceding paragraph, Dr. Richard West and Ms. Mandakini Puri are both trustees of Vornado and members of our Board of Directors. Because of their overlapping interests, Vornado, Mr. Roth, Interstate and the other individuals noted in the preceding paragraphs may have substantial influence over Alexander’s, and on the outcome of any matters submitted to Alexander’s stockholders for approval.  In addition, certain decisions concerning our operations or financial structure may present conflicts of interest among Vornado, Messrs. Roth, Mandelbaum and Wight and Interstate and other security holders.  Vornado, Mr. Roth and Interstate may, in the future, engage in a wide variety of activities in the real estate business which may result in conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting us, such as, which of these entities or persons, if any, may take advantage of potential business opportunities, the business focus of these entities, the types of properties and geographic locations in which these entities make investments, potential competition between business activities conducted, or sought to be conducted, by us, competition for properties and tenants, possible corporate transactions such as acquisitions, and other strategic decisions affecting the future of these entities. There may be conflicts of interest between Vornado, its affiliates and us.Vornado manages, develops and leases our properties under agreements that have one-year terms expiring in March of each year, which are automatically renewable.  Because we share common senior management with Vornado and because five of the trustees of Vornado are on our Board of Directors, the terms of the foregoing agreements and any future agreements may not be comparable to those we could have negotiated with an unaffiliated third party. For a description of Interstate’s ownership of Vornado and Alexander’s, see “Steven Roth, Vornado and Interstate may exercise substantial influence over us.  They and some of our other directors and officers have interests or positions in other entities that may compete with us.” above. 15RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCKThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate.The trading price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate widely as a result of several factors, many of which are outside of our control.  In addition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies.  These broad market fluctuations have in the past and may in the future adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  Among the factors that could affect the price of our common stock are:•our financial condition and performance;•the financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies or defaults;•the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;•actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;•our dividend policy;•the reputation of REITs and real estate investments generally and the attractiveness of REIT equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate companies, and fixed income securities;•uncertainty and volatility in the equity and credit markets;•fluctuations in interest rates;•changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to our securities or those of other REITs;•failure to meet analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates;•speculation in the press or investment community;•strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;•the extent of institutional investor interest in us;•the extent of short-selling of our common stock and the shares of our competitors;•fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;•general financial and economic market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for office, retail and residential REITs and other real estate related companies and the New York City real estate market generally;•domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance; •changes in tax laws and rules; and•all other risk factors addressed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.A significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for stockholders.Alexander’s has additional shares of its common stock available for future issuance, which could decrease the market price of the common stock currently outstanding.The interest of our current stockholders could be diluted if we issue additional equity securities.  As of December 31, 2021, we had authorized but unissued 4,826,550 shares of common stock, par value of $1.00 per share and 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share; of which 17,188 shares of common stock are reserved for issuance upon redemption of the deferred stock units previously granted to our Board of Directors.  In addition, 488,599 shares are available for future grant under the terms of our 2016 Omnibus Stock Plan.  These awards may be granted in the form of options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, deferred stock units, or other equity-based interests, and if granted, would reduce that number of shares available for future grants, provided however that an award that may be settled only in cash, would not reduce the number of shares available under the plan.  We cannot predict the impact that future issuances of common or preferred stock or any exercise of outstanding options or grants of additional equity-based interests would have on the market price of our common stock.16RISKS RELATED TO REGULATORY COMPLIANCEWe might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT, and may be required to pay federal income taxes at corporate rates.Although we believe that we will remain organized and will continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we might fail to remain qualified.  Qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes is governed by highly technical and complex provisions of the Code for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and depends on various facts and circumstances that are not entirely within our control.  In addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the relevant tax laws and/or the federal income tax consequences of qualifying as a REIT. If, with respect to any taxable year, we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT and do not qualify under statutory relief provisions, we could not deduct distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would have to pay federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. The federal income tax payable would include any applicable alternative minimum tax. If we had to pay federal income tax, the amount of money available to distribute to stockholders and pay our indebtedness would be reduced for the year or years involved, and we would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders in that taxable year and in future years until we were able to qualify as a REIT and did so. In addition, we would also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost, unless we were entitled to relief under the relevant statutory provisions. We may face possible adverse changes in federal tax laws, which may result in an increase in our tax liability.At any time, the U.S. federal income tax laws governing REITs or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended. We cannot predict if or when any new U.S. federal income tax law, regulation, or administrative interpretation, or any amendment to any existing U.S. federal income tax law, Treasury regulation or administrative interpretation, will be adopted, promulgated or become effective and any such law, regulation, or interpretation may take effect retroactively. Alexander’s, its taxable REIT subsidiaries, and our security holders could be adversely affected by any such change in, or any new, U.S. federal income tax law, Treasury regulation or administrative interpretation.We may incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and environmental contamination may impair our ability to lease and/or sell real estate.Our operations and properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment, including air and water quality, hazardous or toxic substances and health and safety.  Under some environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances released at a property.  The owner or operator may also be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage or personal injuries and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by those parties because of the contamination.  These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the release of the substances or caused the release.  The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may also impair our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.  Other laws and regulations govern indoor and outdoor air quality including those that can require the abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials in the event of damage, demolition, renovation or remodeling and govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air.  The maintenance and removal of lead paint and certain electrical equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are also regulated by federal and state laws.  We are also subject to risks associated with human exposure to chemical or biological contaminants such as molds, pollens, viruses and bacteria which, above certain levels, can be alleged to be connected to allergic or other health effects and symptoms in susceptible individuals.  We could incur fines for environmental compliance and be held liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to the foregoing regulated substances or related claims arising out of environmental contamination or human exposure to contamination at or from our properties. Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment.  To date, these environmental assessments have not revealed any environmental condition material to our business.  However, identification of new compliance concerns or undiscovered areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, human exposure to contamination or changes in clean-up or compliance requirements could result in significant costs to us. 17We face risks associated with our tenants being designated “Prohibited Persons” by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and similar requirements. Pursuant to Executive Order 13224 and other laws, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury (“OFAC”) maintains a list of persons designated as terrorists or who are otherwise blocked or banned (“Prohibited Persons”) from conducting business or engaging in transactions in the United States and thereby restricts our doing business with such persons. In addition, our leases, loans and other agreements may require us to comply with OFAC and related requirements, and any failure to do so may result in a breach of such agreements.  If a tenant or other party with whom we conduct business is placed on the OFAC list or is otherwise a party with whom we are prohibited from doing business, we may be required to terminate the lease or other agreement or face other penalties.  Any such termination could result in a loss of revenue or otherwise negatively affect our financial results and cash flows.We may face possible adverse state and local tax audits and changes in state and local tax law.Because we are organized and qualify as a REIT, we are generally not subject to federal income taxes, but we are subject to certain state and local taxes. In the normal course of business, certain entities through which we own real estate have undergone tax audits. There can be no assurance that future audits will not occur with increased frequency or that the ultimate result of such audits will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.From time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. A shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we operate may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends and distributions to our stockholders.Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs.The ADA generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, meet certain Federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons.  Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the Federal government or the award of damages to private litigants and/or legal fees to their counsel.  If, under the ADA, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the amount of cash available for distribution to stockholders.Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements.  If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards.  We do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations.18GENERAL RISKSThe occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in our cyber security, as well as other disruptions of our IT networks and related systems, could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information, and/or damage to our business relationships or reputation, all of which could negatively impact our financial results.We face risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the Internet, malware, ransomware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons who access our systems from inside or outside our organization, and other significant disruptions of our IT networks and related systems. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Although we have not experienced cyber incidents that are individually, or in the aggregate, material, we have experienced cyber attacks in the past, which have thus far been mitigated by preventative, detective, and responsive measures that we have put in place. Our IT networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations (including managing our building systems) and, in some cases, may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants. Although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Unauthorized parties, whether within or outside our company, may disrupt or gain access to our systems, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through human error, misfeasance, fraud, trickery, or other forms of deceit, including break-ins, use of stolen credentials, social engineering, phishing, computer viruses or other malicious codes, and similar means of unauthorized and destructive tampering. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed to not be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. A security breach or other significant disruption involving our IT networks and related systems could disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our tenants; result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or others, which others could use to compete against us or which could expose us to damage claims by third-parties for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; result in our inability to maintain the building systems relied upon by our tenants for the efficient use of their leased space; require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result; may require payments to the attackers; subject us to litigation claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, fines, penalties, governmental investigations and enforcement actions or termination of leases or other agreements; or damage our reputation among our tenants and investors generally. Any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. A cyber attack or systems failure could interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting requirements, which could adversely affect us. A cyber attack could also compromise the confidential information of our employees, tenants, customers and vendors. A successful attack could disrupt and materially affect our business operations, including damaging relationships with tenants, customers and vendors. Any compromise of our information security systems could also result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, loss or misuse of the information (which may be confidential, proprietary and/or commercially sensitive in nature) and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business.19Capital markets and economic conditions can materially affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations as well as the value of an investment in our debt and equity securities.There are many factors that can affect the value of our equity securities and any debt securities we may issue in the future, including the state of the capital markets and economy.  Demand for office and retail space typically declines nationwide due to an economic downturn, bankruptcies, downsizing, layoffs and cost cutting.  Government action or inaction may adversely affect the state of the capital markets.  The cost and availability of credit may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads, which may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including our results of operations, and the liquidity and financial condition of our tenants.  Our inability or the inability of our tenants to timely refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs may materially affect our financial condition and results of operations and the value of our equity securities and any debt securities we may issue in the future.  Some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance.We maintain general liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and per property, of which the first $30,000,000 includes communicable disease coverage, and all-risk property and rental value insurance coverage with limits of $1.7 billion per occurrence, including coverage for acts of terrorism, with sub-limits for certain perils such as floods and earthquakes on each of our properties and excluding communicable disease coverage.Fifty Ninth Street Insurance Company, LLC (“FNSIC”), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism, including nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) acts, as defined by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended to date and which has been extended through December 2027. Coverage for acts of terrorism (including NBCR acts) is up to $1.7 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate. Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to FNSIC. For NBCR acts, FNSIC is responsible for a $287,500 deductible and 20% of the balance of a covered loss, and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining 80% of a covered loss. We are ultimately responsible for any loss incurred by FNSIC.We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism or other events. However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future. We are responsible for uninsured losses and for deductibles and losses in excess of our insurance coverage, which could be material.The principal amounts of our mortgage loans are non-recourse to us and the loans contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. If lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain, it could adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance our properties. 20We may be adversely affected by the discontinuation of  London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”).On March 5, 2021, the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) announced that USD LIBOR will no longer be published after June 30, 2023.  The Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) has been identified by market participants as the preferred alternative to USD LIBOR in derivatives and other financial contracts. Our new floating rate loans entered into after December 31, 2021 will no longer reference LIBOR and will reference SOFR or another floating rate.As of December 31, 2021, we had $1,002,544,000 of outstanding debt indexed to LIBOR. $300,000,000 of this debt is subject to interest rate swaps that convert the floating rates to a fixed interest rate. In the transition from the use of LIBOR to SOFR or other alternatives, the level of interest payments we incur may change. In addition, although certain of our LIBOR based obligations provide for alternative methods of calculating the interest rate payable (including transition to an alternative benchmark rate) if LIBOR is not reported and we have been entering into amendments to certain of our financing agreements to provide for alternative benchmark rates if LIBOR is discontinued, uncertainty as to the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher than or lower than or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the interest rates and/or payments that would have been made on our obligations if LIBOR was available in its current form. Use of alternative interest rates or other LIBOR reforms could result in increased volatility or a tightening of credit markets which could adversely affect our ability to obtain cost-effective financing. In addition, the transition of our existing LIBOR financing agreements to alternative benchmarks may result in unanticipated changes to the overall interest rate paid on our liabilities"
5,ALX,ALEXANDER'S INC,2021-02-16,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSMaterial factors that may adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition are summarized below.  The risks and uncertainties described herein may not be the only ones we face.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition. See “Forward-Looking Statements” contained herein on page 4.RISKS RELATED TO OUR PROPERTIES AND INDUSTRYOur business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows have been and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by the recent COVID-19 pandemic and the impact could be material to us.Our business has been adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2020, our “non-essential” retail tenants were ordered to temporarily close and although substantially all re-opened in the latter part of June 2020, there are limitations on occupancy and other restrictions that affect their ability to resume full operations and impact their financial health. In limited circumstances, we have agreed to and may continue to agree to rent deferrals and abatements for certain of our tenants. Numerous Federal, state, local and industry-initiated efforts may also affect our ability to collect rent or enforce remedies for the failure to pay rent. Certain of our tenants may incur significant costs or losses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and/or incur other liabilities related to shelter-in-place orders, quarantines, infection or other related factors. Tenants that experience deteriorating financial conditions may be unwilling or unable to pay rent on a timely basis, or at all.  Specifically, on September 10, 2020, Century 21, which leased 135,000 square feet at our Rego Park II shopping center, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and closed its store on December 7, 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused, and is likely to continue to cause, severe economic, market or other disruptions worldwide. Conditions in the bank lending, capital and other financial markets may deteriorate as a result of the pandemic, our access to capital and other sources of funding may become constrained and the ratios of our debt to asset values may deteriorate, which could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings, renewals or refinancings. In addition, the deterioration of global, national, regional and local economic conditions as a result of the pandemic may ultimately decrease occupancy and/or rent levels across our portfolio as tenants reduce or defer their spending, which may result in less cash flow available for operating costs, to pay our indebtedness and for distribution to our stockholders and the impact could be material. In addition, the value of our real estate assets may decline, which may result in non-cash impairment charges in future periods and the impact could be material. The extent of the COVID-19 pandemic’s effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and intensity of the outbreak and governmental responses thereto, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict. Due to the speed with which the situation is developing, we are not able at this time to estimate the ultimate effect of these factors on our business, but the adverse impact on our business,  results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be material. 7All of our properties are in the greater New York City metropolitan area and are affected by the economic cycles and risks inherent in that area.All of our revenues come from properties located in the greater New York City metropolitan area. Real estate markets are subject to economic downturns and we cannot predict how economic conditions will impact this market in either the short or long term.  Recent declines in the economy and declines in the real estate market in this area, have hurt and could continue to hurt, our financial performance and the value of our properties.  In addition to the factors affecting the national economic condition generally, the factors affecting economic conditions in this area include: •financial performance and productivity of the media, advertising, professional services, financial, technology, retail, insurance and real estate industries;•the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;•business layoffs or downsizing;•industry slowdowns;•relocations of businesses;•changing demographics;•increased telecommuting and use of alternative work places;•changes in the number of domestic and international tourists to our markets (including as a result of changes in the relative strengths of world currencies);•infrastructure quality; •changes in the rates or treatment of the deductibility of state and local taxes; and•any oversupply of, or reduced demand for, real estate.It is impossible for us to predict the future or the effect of trends in the economic and investment climates of the greater New York City metropolitan region, and more generally of the United States, on the real estate market in this area.  Local, national or global economic downturns could negatively affect our business and profitability.We may be adversely affected by trends in office real estate.Work from home, flexible work schedules, open workplaces and teleconferencing are becoming more common and are expected to accelerate as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These practices may enable businesses to reduce their office space requirements. There is also an increasing trend among some businesses to utilize shared office spaces and co-working spaces. A continuation of these trends could, over time, erode the overall demand for office space and, in turn, place downward pressure on occupancy, rental rates and property valuations.We are subject to risks that affect the general and New York City retail environments.Certain of our properties are New York City retail properties.  As such, these properties are affected by the general and New York City retail environments, including the level of consumer spending and consumer confidence, New York City tourism, the threat of terrorism, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing competition from on-line retailers, other retailers and outlet malls and the impact of technological change upon the retail environment generally. For a number of our tenants that operate retail businesses involving high contact interactions with their customers, the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their business has been particularly severe and the recovery more difficult, with customer traffic down significantly. Furthermore, it is unknowable whether consumers’ retail habits will return to norms that existed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. These factors could adversely affect the financial condition of our retail tenants, or result in the bankruptcy of such tenants, and the willingness of retailers to lease space in our retail locations, which could have an adverse effect on our business and profitability. Terrorist attacks may adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to generate cash flow.All of our properties are located in the greater New York City metropolitan area, and our most significant property, 731 Lexington Avenue, is located on Lexington Avenue and 59th Street in Manhattan.  In response to a terrorist attack or the perceived threat of terrorism, tenants in this area may choose to relocate their businesses to less populated, lower-profile areas of the United States that may be perceived to be less likely targets of future terrorist activity and fewer customers may choose to patronize businesses in this area. This, in turn, could trigger a decrease in the demand for space in these markets, which could increase vacancies in our properties and force us to lease our properties on less favorable terms. Furthermore, we may experience increased costs for security, equipment and personnel.  As a result, the value of our properties and the level of our revenues could decline materially. 8Natural disasters and the effects of climate change could have a concentrated impact on the area which we operate and could adversely impact our results.Our investments are in the greater New York City metropolitan area and since they are concentrated along the Eastern Seaboard, natural disasters, including hurricanes, could cause significant damage to our properties and the surrounding environment or area.  Potentially adverse consequences of “global warming,” including rising sea levels, could similarly have an impact on our properties and the economy of the greater New York City metropolitan area in which we operate. Government efforts to combat climate change may impact the cost of operating our properties and real estate in the New York City metropolitan area.  Over time, these conditions could result in declining demand for office space in our buildings or the inability of us to operate the buildings at all. Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) property insurance on terms we find acceptable, increasing the cost of energy at our properties and requiring us to expend funds as we seek to repair and protect our properties against such risks. The incurrence of these losses, costs or business interruptions may adversely affect our operating and financial results.Our performance and the value of an investment in us are subject to risks associated with our real estate assets and with the real estate industry.The value of our real estate and the value of an investment in us fluctuates depending on conditions in the general economy and the real estate business.  These conditions may also adversely impact our revenues and cash flows. The factors that affect the value of our real estate include, among other things: •global, national, regional and local economic conditions;•the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;•competition from other available space;•local conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area;•how well we manage our properties;•the development and/or redevelopment of our properties;•changes in market rental rates;•the timing and costs associated with property improvements and rentals;•whether we are able to pass all or portions of any increases in operating costs through to tenants;•political and regulatory conditions;•changes in real estate taxes and other expenses;  •the ability of state and local governments to operate within their budgets;•whether tenants and users such as customers and shoppers consider a property attractive;•changes in consumer preferences adversely affecting retailers and retail store values;•changes in space utilization by our tenants due to technology, economic conditions and business environment;•the financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies or defaults;•consequences of any armed conflict involving, or terrorist attack against, the United States or individual acts of                      violence in public spaces;•trends in office real estate;•the impact on our retail tenants and demand for retail space at our properties due to increased competition from online shopping;•availability of financing on acceptable terms or at all;•inflation or deflation;•fluctuations in interest rates;•our ability to obtain adequate insurance;•changes in zoning laws and taxation;•government regulation;•potential liability under environmental or other laws or regulations;•natural disasters;•general competitive factors; and•climate changes. The rents we receive and the occupancy levels at our properties may decline as a result of adverse changes in any of these factors.  If our rental revenues and/or occupancy levels decline, we generally would expect to have less cash available for operating costs, to pay our indebtedness and for distribution to our stockholders.  In addition, some of our major expenses, including mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs generally do not decline when the related rents decline.9Real estate is a competitive business and that competition may adversely impact us.We compete with a large number of real estate investors, property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments.  Principal factors of competition are rents charged, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and the quality of services provided.  Substantially all of our properties face competition from similar properties in the same market, which may adversely impact the rents we can charge at those properties and our results of operations.  We depend on leasing space to tenants on economically favorable terms and collecting rent from tenants who may not be able to pay.Our financial results depend significantly on leasing space in our properties to tenants on economically favorable terms.  In addition, because a majority of our income is derived from renting real property, our income, funds available to pay indebtedness and for distributions to stockholders will decrease if certain of our tenants cannot pay their rent or if we are not able to maintain our occupancy levels on favorable terms.  If a tenant does not pay its rent, we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and might incur substantial legal and other costs. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,  Federal, state and local regulations and economic conditions have affected our ability to collect rent or enforce remedies for the failure to pay rent. Even if we are able to enforce our rights, a tenant may not have recoverable assets. Additionally, in limited circumstances, we have agreed and may continue to agree to rent deferrals and abatements for certain of our tenants. Bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants may decrease our revenues, net income and available cash.From time to time, some of our tenants have declared bankruptcy, and other tenants may declare bankruptcy or become insolvent in the future. On September 10, 2020, Century 21, which leased 135,000 square feet at our Rego Park II shopping center ($6,400,000 of annual revenue), filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and closed its store on December 7, 2020. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant could cause us to suffer lower revenues and operational difficulties, including leasing the remainder of the property.  As a result, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant or multiple tenants could result in decreased revenues, net income and funds available to pay our indebtedness or make distributions to stockholders.We depend upon anchor tenants to attract shoppers at our Rego Park I and II retail properties and decisions made by these tenants, or adverse developments in the businesses of these tenants, could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our Rego Park I and II retail properties are anchored by well-known department stores and other tenants who generate shopping traffic.  The value of these properties would be adversely affected if our anchor tenants failed to meet their contractual obligations, sought concessions in order to continue operations or ceased their operations, including as a result of bankruptcy.  If the level of sales of stores operating in our properties were to decline significantly due to economic conditions, increased competition from online shopping, closing of anchors or for other reasons, tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges.  In the event of a default by a tenant or anchor, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord.  Additionally, closure of an anchor or major tenant could result in lease terminations by, or reductions of rent from, other tenants if the other tenants’ leases have co-tenancy clauses. On September 10, 2020, Century 21, which leased 135,000 square feet at our Rego Park II shopping center ($6,400,000 of annual revenue), filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and closed its store on December 7, 2020. We may be unable to renew leases or relet space as leases expire.When our tenants decide not to renew their leases upon their expiration, we may not be able to relet the space. Even if tenants do renew or we can relet the space, the terms of renewal or reletting, considering among other things, the cost of improvements to the property and leasing commissions, may be less favorable than the terms in the expired leases. In addition, changes in space utilization by our tenants may impact our ability to renew or relet space without the need to incur substantial costs in renovating or redesigning the internal configuration of the relevant property. If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the space at similar rates or if we incur substantial costs in renewing or reletting the space, our cash flow and ability to service debt obligations and pay dividends and distributions to stockholders could be adversely affected.  731 Lexington Avenue accounts for a substantial portion of our revenues.  Loss of or damage to the building would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.731 Lexington Avenue accounted for revenue of $137,718,000, $153,797,000 and $151,834,000 in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, representing approximately 69%, 68% and 65% of our total revenues in each year, respectively.  Loss of or damage to the building in excess of our insurance coverage, including as a result of a terrorist attack, would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.10Bloomberg represents a significant portion of our revenues.  Loss of Bloomberg as a tenant or deterioration in Bloomberg’s credit quality could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Bloomberg accounted for revenue of $109,066,000, $109,113,000 and $107,356,000 in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, representing approximately 55%, 48% and 46% of our total revenues in each year, respectively.  No other tenant accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues.  If we were to lose Bloomberg as a tenant, or if Bloomberg were to be unable to fulfill its obligations under its lease, it would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS AND STRATEGIESWe may acquire, develop, or redevelop properties and this may create risks.Although our stated business strategy is not to engage in acquisitions, we may acquire, develop or redevelop properties when we believe that an acquisition, development or redevelopment project is otherwise consistent with our business strategy.  We may not succeed in (i) developing, redeveloping or acquiring properties; (ii) completing these activities on time or within budget; and (iii) leasing or selling developed, redeveloped or acquired properties at amounts sufficient to cover our costs.  Competition in these activities could also significantly increase our costs. Difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert management’s attention. Acquisitions, developments or redevelopments in new markets or types of properties where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in weaker than anticipated performance. We may also abandon acquisition, development or redevelopment opportunities that we have begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred.  Furthermore, we may be exposed to the liabilities of properties acquired, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition. We are exposed to risks associated with property redevelopment and repositioning that could adversely affect us, including our financial condition and results of operations.We continue to engage in redevelopment and repositioning activities with respect to our properties, and, accordingly, we are subject to certain risks, which could adversely affect us, including our financial condition and results of operations. These risks include, without limitation, (i) the availability and pricing of financing on favorable terms or at all; (ii) the availability and timely receipt of zoning and other regulatory approvals; (iii) the potential for the fluctuation of occupancy rates and rents at redeveloped properties, which may result in our investment not being profitable; (iv) start up, repositioning and redevelopment costs may be higher than anticipated; (v) cost overruns and untimely completion of construction (including risks beyond our control, such as weather or labor conditions, or material shortages); (vi) the potential that we may fail to recover expenses already incurred if we abandon development or redevelopment opportunities after we begin to explore them; (vii) the potential that we may expend funds on and devote management time to projects which we do not complete; (viii) the inability to lease a property on schedule or at all, resulting in increased construction or redevelopment costs; and (ix) the possibility that properties will be leased at below expected rental rates. These risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses and could prevent the initiation or the completion of redevelopment activities, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, the market value of our common shares and ability to satisfy our principal and interest obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders.It may be difficult to sell real estate timely, which may limit our flexibility.Real estate investments are relatively illiquid. Consequently, we may have limited ability to dispose of assets in our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions which could have an adverse effect on our sources of working capital and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations.  We have an investment in marketable equity securities.  The value of this investment may decline as a result of operating performance or economic or market conditions.We have an investment in The Macerich Company (“Macerich”), a retail shopping center company.  As of December 31, 2020, this investment had a carrying amount of $6,024,000. A decline in the value of this investment due to, among other reasons, Macerich’s operating performance or economic or market conditions, would result in recognized GAAP losses, which could be material. 11RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS AND ACCESS TO CAPITALSubstantially all of our assets are owned by subsidiaries.  We depend on dividends and distributions from these subsidiaries.  The creditors of these subsidiaries are entitled to amounts payable to them by the subsidiaries before the subsidiaries may pay any dividends or distributions to us.Substantially all of our properties and assets are held through our subsidiaries.  We depend on cash distributions and dividends from our subsidiaries for substantially all of our cash flow.  The creditors of each of our direct and indirect subsidiaries are entitled to payment of that subsidiary’s obligations to them when due and payable before that subsidiary may make distributions or dividends to us.  Thus, our ability to pay dividends, if any, to our security holders depends on our subsidiaries’ ability to first satisfy their obligations to their creditors and our ability to satisfy our obligations, if any, to our creditors. In addition, our participation in any distribution of the assets of any of our direct or indirect subsidiaries upon the liquidation, reorganization or insolvency of the subsidiary, is only after the claims of the creditors, including trade creditors, and preferred security holders, if any, of the applicable direct or indirect subsidiaries are satisfied. Our existing financing documents contain covenants and restrictions that may restrict our operational and financial flexibility.As of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding mortgage indebtedness of $1,164,544,000, secured by four of our properties.  These mortgages contain covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness on these properties, provide for lender approval of tenants’ leases in certain circumstances, and provide for yield maintenance or defeasance premiums to prepay them.  These mortgages may significantly restrict our operational and financial flexibility. In addition, if we were to fail to perform our obligations under existing indebtedness or become insolvent or were liquidated, secured creditors would be entitled to payment in full from the proceeds of the sale of the pledged assets prior to any proceeds being paid to other creditors or to any holders of our securities.  In such an event, it is possible that we would have insufficient assets remaining to make payments to other creditors or to any holders of our securities. We have a substantial amount of indebtedness that could affect our future operations.As of December 31, 2020, total debt outstanding was $1,164,544,000. We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service. Our debt service costs generally will not be reduced if developments in the market or at our properties, such as the entry of new competitors or the loss of major tenants, cause a reduction in the income from our properties. Should such events occur, our operations may be adversely affected. If a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from such property is insufficient to pay that indebtedness, the property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value. We have outstanding debt, and the amount of debt and its cost may increase and refinancing may not be available on acceptable terms.As of December 31, 2020, total debt outstanding was $1,164,544,000 and our ratio of total debt to total enterprise value was 54.1%.  “Enterprise value” means the market equity value of our common stock, plus debt, less cash and cash equivalents at such date.  In addition, we have significant debt service obligations.  For the year ended December 31, 2020, our cash payments for principal and interest were $72,476,000.  In the future, we may incur additional debt, and thus increase the ratio of total debt to total enterprise value.  If our level of indebtedness increases, there may be an increased risk of default which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, in a rising interest rate environment, the cost of refinancing our existing debt and any new debt or market rate security or instrument may increase.  Continued uncertainty in the equity and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms or at all, which may negatively affect our ability to refinance our debt.RISKS RELATED TO OUR ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURELoss of our key personnel could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our common stock.We are dependent on the efforts of Steven Roth, our Chief Executive Officer.  Although we believe that we could find a replacement, the loss of his services could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our common stock.12Alexander’s charter documents and applicable law may hinder any attempt to acquire us.Provisions in Alexander’s certificate of incorporation and by laws, as well as provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) and Delaware corporate law, may delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or a tender offer, even if such action might be beneficial to stockholders, and limit the stockholders’ opportunity to receive a potential premium for their shares of common stock over then prevailing market prices. Primarily to facilitate maintenance of its qualification as a REIT, Alexander’s certificate of incorporation generally prohibits ownership, directly, indirectly or beneficially, by any single stockholder of more than 9.9% of the outstanding shares of preferred stock of any class or 4.9% of outstanding common stock of any class.  The Board of Directors may waive or modify these ownership limits with respect to one or more persons if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of these limits will not jeopardize Alexander’s status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.  In addition, the Board of Directors has, subject to certain conditions and limitations, exempted Vornado and certain of its affiliates from these ownership limitations.  Stock owned in violation of these ownership limits will be subject to the loss of rights and other restrictions.  These ownership limits may have the effect of inhibiting or impeding a change in control. Alexander’s Board of Directors is divided into three classes of directors.  Directors of each class are chosen for three-year staggered terms.  Staggered terms of directors may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management, even though changes in management or a change in control might be in the best interest of our stockholders. In addition, Alexander’s charter documents authorize the Board of Directors to: •cause Alexander’s to issue additional authorized but unissued common stock or preferred stock;•classify or reclassify, in one or more series, any unissued preferred stock; and•set the preferences, rights and other terms of any classified or reclassified stock that Alexander’s issues. The Board of Directors could establish a series of preferred stock with terms that could delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Alexander’s or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our   stockholders, although the Board of Directors does not, at present, intend to establish a series of preferred stock of this kind.  Alexander’s charter documents contain other provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of the Company or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. In addition, Vornado, Interstate and its three general partners (each of whom are both trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexander’s) together beneficially own approximately 58.5% of our outstanding shares of common stock.  This degree of ownership is likely to reduce the possibility of a tender offer or an attempt to change control of the Company by a third party. We may change our policies without obtaining the approval of our stockholders.Our operating and financial policies, including our policies with respect to acquisitions of real estate or other assets, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and dividends, are exclusively determined by our Board of Directors.  Accordingly, our stockholders do not control these policies.13Steven Roth, Vornado and Interstate may exercise substantial influence over us.  They and some of our other directors and officers have interests or positions in other entities that may compete with us.As of December 31, 2020, Interstate and its partners owned approximately 7.0% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and approximately 26.1% of our outstanding common stock.  Steven Roth, David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr. are the partners of Interstate.  Mr. Roth is the Chairman of our Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado and the Managing General Partner of Interstate.  Mr. Wight and Mr. Mandelbaum are both trustees of Vornado and members of our Board of Directors.  In addition, Vornado manages and leases the real estate assets of Interstate. As of December 31, 2020, Vornado owned 32.4% of our outstanding common stock, in addition to the 26.1% owned by Interstate and its partners.  In addition to the relationships described in the immediately preceding paragraph, Dr. Richard West and Mandakini Puri are both trustees of Vornado and members of our Board of Directors and Matthew Iocco, our Chief Financial Officer, is the Executive Vice President - Chief Accounting Officer of Vornado.   Because of their overlapping interests, Vornado, Mr. Roth, Interstate and the other individuals noted in the preceding paragraphs may have substantial influence over Alexander’s, and on the outcome of any matters submitted to Alexander’s stockholders for approval.  In addition, certain decisions concerning our operations or financial structure may present conflicts of interest among Vornado, Messrs. Roth, Mandelbaum and Wight and Interstate and other security holders.  Vornado, Mr. Roth and Interstate may, in the future, engage in a wide variety of activities in the real estate business which may result in conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting us, such as, which of these entities or persons, if any, may take advantage of potential business opportunities, the business focus of these entities, the types of properties and geographic locations in which these entities make investments, potential competition between business activities conducted, or sought to be conducted, by us, competition for properties and tenants, possible corporate transactions such as acquisitions, and other strategic decisions affecting the future of these entities. There may be conflicts of interest between Vornado, its affiliates and us.Vornado manages, develops and leases our properties under agreements that have one-year terms expiring in March of each year, which are automatically renewable.  Because we share common senior management with Vornado and because five of the trustees of Vornado are on our Board of Directors, the terms of the foregoing agreements and any future agreements may not be comparable to those we could have negotiated with an unaffiliated third party. For a description of Interstate’s ownership of Vornado and Alexander’s, see “Steven Roth, Vornado and Interstate may exercise substantial influence over us.  They and some of our other directors and officers have interests or positions in other entities that may compete with us.” above. 14RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON SHARESThe trading price of our common shares has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate.The trading price of our common shares has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate widely as a result of several factors, many of which are outside of our control.  In addition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies.  These broad market fluctuations have in the past and may in the future adversely affect the market price of our common shares.  Among the factors that could affect the price of our common shares are:•our financial condition and performance;•the financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies or defaults;•the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;•actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;•our dividend policy;•the reputation of REITs and real estate investments generally and the attractiveness of REIT equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate companies, and fixed income securities;•uncertainty and volatility in the equity and credit markets;•fluctuations in interest rates;•changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to our securities or those of other REITs;•failure to meet analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates;•speculation in the press or investment community;•strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;•the extent of institutional investor interest in us;•the extent of short-selling of our common shares and the shares of our competitors;•fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;•general financial and economic market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for REITs and other real estate related companies;•domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance; •changes in tax laws and rules; and•all other risk factors addressed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.A significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for stockholders.Alexander’s has additional shares of its common stock available for future issuance, which could decrease the market price of the common stock currently outstanding.The interest of our current stockholders could be diluted if we issue additional equity securities.  As of December 31, 2020, we had authorized but unissued 4,826,550 shares of common stock, par value of $1.00 per share and 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share; of which 14,916 shares of common stock are reserved for issuance upon redemption of the deferred stock units previously granted to our Board of Directors.  In addition, 490,871 shares are available for future grant under the terms of our 2016 Omnibus Stock Plan.  These awards may be granted in the form of options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, deferred stock units, or other equity-based interests, and if granted, would reduce that number of shares available for future grants, provided however that an award that may be settled only in cash, would not reduce the number of shares available under the plan.  We cannot predict the impact that future issuances of common or preferred stock or any exercise of outstanding options or grants of additional equity-based interests would have on the market price of our common stock.15RISKS RELATED TO REGULATORY COMPLIANCEWe might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT, and may be required to pay federal income taxes at corporate rates.Although we believe that we will remain organized and will continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we might fail to remain qualified.  Qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes is governed by highly technical and complex provisions of the Code for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and depends on various facts and circumstances that are not entirely within our control.  In addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the relevant tax laws and/or the federal income tax consequences of qualifying as a REIT. If, with respect to any taxable year, we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT and do not qualify under statutory relief provisions, we could not deduct distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would have to pay federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. The federal income tax payable would include any applicable alternative minimum tax. If we had to pay federal income tax, the amount of money available to distribute to stockholders and pay our indebtedness would be reduced for the year or years involved, and we would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders in that taxable year and in future years until we were able to qualify as a REIT and did so. In addition, we would also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost, unless we were entitled to relief under the relevant statutory provisions. We may face possible adverse changes in federal tax laws, which may result in an increase in our tax liability.At any time, the U.S. federal income tax laws governing REITs or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended. We cannot predict if or when any new U.S. federal income tax law, regulation, or administrative interpretation, or any amendment to any existing U.S. federal income tax law, Treasury regulation or administrative interpretation, will be adopted, promulgated or become effective and any such law, regulation, or interpretation may take effect retroactively. Alexander’s, its taxable REIT subsidiaries, and our security holders could be adversely affected by any such change in, or any new, U.S. federal income tax law, Treasury regulation or administrative interpretation.We may incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and environmental contamination may impair our ability to lease and/or sell real estate.Our operations and properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment, including air and water quality, hazardous or toxic substances and health and safety.  Under some environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances released at a property.  The owner or operator may also be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage or personal injuries and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by those parties because of the contamination.  These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the release of the substances or caused the release.  The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may also impair our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.  Other laws and regulations govern indoor and outdoor air quality including those that can require the abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials in the event of damage, demolition, renovation or remodeling and govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air.  The maintenance and removal of lead paint and certain electrical equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are also regulated by federal and state laws.  We are also subject to risks associated with human exposure to chemical or biological contaminants such as molds, pollens, viruses and bacteria which, above certain levels, can be alleged to be connected to allergic or other health effects and symptoms in susceptible individuals.  We could incur fines for environmental compliance and be held liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to the foregoing regulated substances or related claims arising out of environmental contamination or human exposure to contamination at or from our properties. Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment.  To date, these environmental assessments have not revealed any environmental condition material to our business.  However, identification of new compliance concerns or undiscovered areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, human exposure to contamination or changes in clean-up or compliance requirements could result in significant costs to us. In addition, we may become subject to costs or taxes, or increases therein, associated with natural resource or energy usage (such as a “carbon tax”).  These costs or taxes could increase our operating costs and decrease the cash available to pay our obligations or distribute to stockholders.16We face risks associated with our tenants being designated “Prohibited Persons” by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and similar requirements. Pursuant to Executive Order 13224 and other laws, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury (“OFAC”) maintains a list of persons designated as terrorists or who are otherwise blocked or banned (“Prohibited Persons”) from conducting business or engaging in transactions in the United States and thereby restricts our doing business with such persons. In addition, our leases, loans and other agreements may require us to comply with OFAC and related requirements, and any failure to do so may result in a breach of such agreements.  If a tenant or other party with whom we conduct business is placed on the OFAC list or is otherwise a party with whom we are prohibited from doing business, we may be required to terminate the lease or other agreement or face other penalties.  Any such termination could result in a loss of revenue or otherwise negatively affect our financial results and cash flows.We may face possible adverse state and local tax audits and changes in state and local tax law.Because we are organized and qualify as a REIT, we are generally not subject to federal income taxes, but we are subject to certain state and local taxes. In the normal course of business, certain entities through which we own real estate have undergone tax audits. There can be no assurance that future audits will not occur with increased frequency or that the ultimate result of such audits will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.From time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. A shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we operate may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends and distributions to our stockholders.Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs.The ADA generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, meet certain Federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons.  Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the Federal government or the award of damages to private litigants and/or legal fees to their counsel.  If, under the ADA, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the amount of cash available for distribution to stockholders.Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements.  If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards.  We do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations.17GENERAL RISKSThe occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in our cyber security, as well as other disruptions of our IT networks and related systems, could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information, and/or damage to our business relationships or reputation, all of which could negatively impact our financial results.We face risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons who access our systems from inside or outside our organization, and other significant disruptions of our IT networks and related systems. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Although we have not experienced cyber incidents that are individually, or in the aggregate, material, we have experienced cyber attacks in the past, which have thus far been mitigated by preventative, detective, and responsive measures that we have put in place. Our IT networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations (including managing our building systems) and, in some cases, may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants. Although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Unauthorized parties, whether within or outside our company, may disrupt or gain access to our systems, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through human error, misfeasance, fraud, trickery, or other forms of deceit, including break-ins, use of stolen credentials, social engineering, phishing, computer viruses or other malicious codes, and similar means of unauthorized and destructive tampering. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed to not be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. A security breach or other significant disruption involving our IT networks and related systems could disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our tenants; result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or others, which others could use to compete against us or which could expose us to damage claims by third-parties for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; result in our inability to maintain the building systems relied upon by our tenants for the efficient use of their leased space; require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result; subject us to litigation claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, fines, penalties, governmental investigations and enforcement actions or termination of leases or other agreements; or damage our reputation among our tenants and investors generally. Any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. A cyber attack or systems failure could interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting requirements, which could adversely affect us. A cyber attack could also compromise the confidential information of our employees, tenants, customers and vendors. A successful attack could disrupt and materially affect our business operations, including damaging relationships with tenants, customers and vendors. Any compromise of our information security systems could also result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, loss or misuse of the information (which may be confidential, proprietary and/or commercially sensitive in nature) and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business.18Capital markets and economic conditions can materially affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations as well as the value of an investment in our debt and equity securities.There are many factors that can affect the value of our equity securities and any debt securities we may issue in the future, including the state of the capital markets and economy.  Demand for office and retail space typically declines nationwide due to an economic downturn, bankruptcies, downsizing, layoffs and cost cutting.  Government action or inaction may adversely affect the state of the capital markets.  The cost and availability of credit may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads, which may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including our results of operations, and the liquidity and financial condition of our tenants.  Our inability or the inability of our tenants to timely refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs may materially affect our financial condition and results of operations and the value of our equity securities and any debt securities we may issue in the future.  Some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance.We maintain general liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and per property, of which the first $1,000,000 includes communicable disease coverage, and all-risk property and rental value insurance coverage with limits of $1.7 billion per occurrence, including coverage for acts of terrorism, with sub-limits for certain perils such as floods and earthquakes on each of our properties and excluding communicable disease coverage.Fifty Ninth Street Insurance Company, LLC (“FNSIC”), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism, including nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) acts, as defined by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended to date and which has been extended through December 2027. Coverage for acts of terrorism (including NBCR acts) is up to $1.7 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate. Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to FNSIC. For NBCR acts, FNSIC is responsible for a $275,000 deductible and 20% of the balance of a covered loss, and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining 80% of a covered loss. We are ultimately responsible for any loss incurred by FNSIC.We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism or other events. However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future. We are responsible for uninsured losses and for deductibles and losses in excess of our insurance coverage, which could be material.The principal amounts of our mortgage loans are non-recourse to us and the loans contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. If lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain, it could adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance our properties. 19Changes in the method pursuant to which the LIBOR rates are determined and phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may affect our financial results.The chief executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), announced that the FCA intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. In response, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized the Alternative Reference Rates Committee which identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as its preferred alternative to USD-LIBOR in derivatives and other financial contracts. In November 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited, the benchmark administrator for USD LIBOR rates, proposed extending the publication of certain commonly used USD LIBOR settings until June 30, 2023 and the FCA issued a statement supporting such proposal. In connection with this proposal, certain U.S. banking regulators issued guidance strongly encouraging banks to generally cease entering into new contracts referencing USD LIBOR as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, including when LIBOR will cease to be available or when there will be sufficient liquidity in the SOFR markets. We have outstanding debt with variable rates based on LIBOR. In the transition from the use of LIBOR to SOFR or other alternatives, the level of interest payments we incur may change. In addition, although certain of our LIBOR based obligations provide for alternative methods of calculating the related interest rate payable (including transition to an alternative benchmark rate) if LIBOR is not reported, uncertainty as to the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher than, lower than or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the interest rates and/or payments that would have been made on our obligations if LIBOR was available in its current form. Use of alternative interest rates or other LIBOR reforms could result in increased volatility or a tightening of credit markets which could adversely affect our ability to obtain cost-effective financing. In addition, the transition of our existing LIBOR financing agreements to alternative benchmarks may result in unanticipated changes to the overall interest rate paid on our liabilities"
4,ALX,ALEXANDER'S INC,2020-02-18,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSMaterial factors that may adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition are summarized below.  The risks and uncertainties described herein may not be the only ones we face.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition. See “Forward-Looking Statements” contained herein on page 4.OUR INVESTMENTS ARE CONCENTRATED IN THE GREATER NEW YORK CITY METROPOLITAN AREA. CIRCUMSTANCES AFFECTING THIS AREA GENERALLY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.All of our properties are in the greater New York City metropolitan area and are affected by the economic cycles and risks inherent in that area.All of our revenues come from properties located in the greater New York City metropolitan area.  Real estate markets are subject to economic downturns and we cannot predict how economic conditions will impact this market in either the short or long term.  Declines in the economy or declines in the real estate market in this area could hurt our financial performance and the value of our properties.  In addition to the factors affecting the national economic condition generally, the factors affecting economic conditions in this area include: •financial performance and productivity of the media, advertising, professional services, financial, technology, retail, insurance and real estate industries;•business layoffs or downsizing;•industry slowdowns;•relocations of businesses;•changing demographics;•increased telecommuting and use of alternative work places;•changes in the number of domestic and international tourists to our markets (including as a result of changes in the relative strengths of world currencies);•infrastructure quality; •changes in the rates or treatment of the deductibility of state and local taxes; and•any oversupply of, or reduced demand for, real estate.It is impossible for us to predict the future or the effect of trends in the economic and investment climates of the greater New York City metropolitan region, and more generally of the United States, on the real estate market in this area.  Local, national or global economic downturns could negatively affect our business and profitability.We are subject to risks that affect the general and New York City retail environments.Certain of our properties are New York City retail properties.  As such, these properties are affected by the general and New York City retail environments, including the level of consumer spending and consumer confidence, New York City tourism, the threat of terrorism, increasing competition from on-line retailers, other retailers and outlet malls and the impact of technological change upon the retail environment generally. These factors could adversely affect the financial condition of our retail tenants, or result in the bankruptcy of such tenants, and the willingness of retailers to lease space in our retail locations, which could have an adverse effect on our business and profitability. Terrorist attacks may adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to generate cash flow.All of our properties are located in the greater New York City metropolitan area, and our most significant property, 731 Lexington Avenue, is located on Lexington Avenue and 59th Street in Manhattan.  In response to a terrorist attack or the perceived threat of terrorism, tenants in this area may choose to relocate their businesses to less populated, lower-profile areas of the United States that may be perceived to be less likely targets of future terrorist activity and fewer customers may choose to patronize businesses in this area. This, in turn, could trigger a decrease in the demand for space in these markets, which could increase vacancies in our properties and force us to lease our properties on less favorable terms. Furthermore, we may experience increased costs for security, equipment and personnel.  As a result, the value of our properties and the level of our revenues could decline materially. 7Natural disasters and the effects of climate change could have a concentrated impact on the area which we operate and could adversely impact our results.Our investments are in the greater New York City metropolitan area and since they are concentrated along the Eastern Seaboard, natural disasters, including hurricanes, could cause significant damage to our properties and the surrounding environment or area.  Potentially adverse consequences of “global warming,” including rising sea levels, could similarly have an impact on our properties and the economy of the greater New York City metropolitan area in which we operate. Over time, these conditions could result in declining demand for office space in our buildings or the inability of us to operate the buildings at all. Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) property insurance on terms we find acceptable, increasing the cost of energy at our properties and requiring us to expend funds as we seek to repair and protect our properties against such risks. The incurrence of these losses, costs or business interruptions may adversely affect our operating and financial results.REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS’ VALUE AND INCOME FLUCTUATE DUE TO VARIOUS FACTORS.Our performance and the value of an investment in us are subject to risks associated with our real estate assets and with the real estate industry.The value of our real estate and the value of an investment in us fluctuates depending on conditions in the general economy and the real estate business.  These conditions may also adversely impact our revenues and cash flows. The factors that affect the value of our real estate include, among other things: •global, national, regional and local economic conditions;•competition from other available space;•local conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area;•how well we manage our properties;•the development and/or redevelopment of our properties;•changes in market rental rates;•the timing and costs associated with property improvements and rentals;•whether we are able to pass all or portions of any increases in operating costs through to tenants;•changes in real estate taxes and other expenses;  •the ability of state and local governments to operate within their budgets;•whether tenants and users such as customers and shoppers consider a property attractive;•changes in consumer preferences adversely affecting retailers and retail store values;•changes in space utilization by our tenants due to technology, economic conditions and business environment;•the financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies or defaults;•consequences of any armed conflict involving, or terrorist attack against, the United States or individual acts of                      violence in public spaces;•trends in office real estate;•the impact on our retail tenants and demand for retail space at our properties due to increased competition from online shopping;•availability of financing on acceptable terms or at all;•inflation or deflation;•fluctuations in interest rates;•our ability to obtain adequate insurance;•changes in zoning laws and taxation;•government regulation;•potential liability under environmental or other laws or regulations;•natural disasters;•general competitive factors; and•climate changes. The rents we receive and the occupancy levels at our properties may decline as a result of adverse changes in any of these factors.  If our rental revenues and/or occupancy levels decline, we generally would expect to have less cash available for operating costs, to pay our indebtedness and for distribution to our stockholders.  In addition, some of our major expenses, including mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs generally do not decline when the related rents decline. 8Capital markets and economic conditions can materially affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations as well as the value of an investment in our debt and equity securities.There are many factors that can affect the value of our equity securities and any debt securities we may issue in the future, including the state of the capital markets and economy.  Demand for office and retail space typically declines nationwide due to an economic downturn, bankruptcies, downsizing, layoffs and cost cutting.  Government action or inaction may adversely affect the state of the capital markets.  The cost and availability of credit may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads, which may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including our results of operations, and the liquidity and financial condition of our tenants.  Our inability or the inability of our tenants to timely refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs may materially affect our financial condition and results of operations and the value of our equity securities and any debt securities we may issue in the future. U.S. federal tax reform legislation now and in the future could affect REITs generally, the geographic markets in which we operate, the trading of our shares and our results of operations, both positively and negatively, in ways that are difficult to anticipate.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “2017 Act”) represented sweeping tax reform legislation that made significant changes to corporate and individual tax rates and the calculation of taxes, as well as international tax rules. As a REIT, we are generally not required to pay federal taxes otherwise applicable to regular corporations if we comply with the various tax regulations governing REITs. Shareholders, however, are generally required to pay taxes on REIT dividends. The 2017 Act and future tax reform legislation could impact our share price or how shareholders and potential investors view an investment in REITs.  For example, the decrease in corporate tax rates in the 2017 Act could decrease the attractiveness of the REIT structure relative to companies that are not organized as REITs. In addition, while certain elements of the 2017 Act do not impact us directly as a REIT, they could impact the geographic markets in which we operate as well as our tenants in ways, both positive and negative, that are difficult to anticipate. For example, the limitation in the 2017 Act on the deductibility of certain state and local taxes may make operating in jurisdictions that impose such taxes at higher rates less desirable than operating in jurisdictions imposing such taxes at lower rates.  The overall impact of the 2017 Act also depends on the future interpretations and regulations that may be issued by U.S. tax authorities, and it is possible that future guidance could adversely impact us.Real estate is a competitive business and that competition may adversely impact us.We compete with a large number of real estate investors, property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments.  Principal factors of competition are rents charged, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and the quality of services provided.  Substantially all of our properties face competition from similar properties in the same market, which may adversely impact the rents we can charge at those properties and our results of operations. We may be adversely affected by trends in office real estate.Telecommuting, flexible work schedules, open workplaces and teleconferencing are becoming more common. These practices enable businesses to reduce their office space requirements. There is also an increasing trend among some businesses to utilize shared office spaces and co-working spaces. A continuation of these trends could, over time, erode the overall demand for office space and, in turn, place downward pressure on occupancy, rental rates and property valuations.We depend on leasing space to tenants on economically favorable terms and collecting rent from tenants who may not be able to pay.Our financial results depend significantly on leasing space in our properties to tenants on economically favorable terms.  In addition, because a majority of our income is derived from renting real property, our income, funds available to pay indebtedness and for distributions to stockholders will decrease if certain of our tenants cannot pay their rent or if we are not able to maintain our occupancy levels on favorable terms.  If a tenant does not pay its rent, we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and might incur substantial legal and other costs. Even if we are able to enforce our rights, a tenant may not have recoverable assets.Bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants may decrease our revenues, net income and available cash.From time to time, some of our tenants have declared bankruptcy, and other tenants may declare bankruptcy or become insolvent in the future.  The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant could cause us to suffer lower revenues and operational difficulties, including leasing the remainder of the property.  As a result, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant or multiple tenants could result in decreased net income and funds available to pay our indebtedness or make distributions to stockholders.9We depend upon anchor tenants to attract shoppers at our Rego Park I and II retail properties and decisions made by these tenants, or adverse developments in the businesses of these tenants, could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our Rego Park I and II retail properties are anchored by well-known department stores and other tenants who generate shopping traffic.  The value of these properties would be adversely affected if our anchor tenants failed to meet their contractual obligations, sought concessions in order to continue operations or ceased their operations, including as a result of bankruptcy.  If the level of sales of stores operating in our properties were to decline significantly due to economic conditions, increased competition from online shopping, closing of anchors or for other reasons, tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges.  In the event of a default by a tenant or anchor, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord.  Additionally, closure of an anchor or major tenant could result in lease terminations by, or reductions of rent from, other tenants if the other tenants’ leases have co-tenancy clauses. On April 4, 2017, Sears closed its 195,000 square foot store at our Rego Park I shopping center ($10,300,000 of annual revenue). On October 15, 2018, Sears filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy relief and rejected its lease. On April 13, 2019, Kohl’s closed its 133,000 square foot store at our Rego Park II shopping center. On January 24, 2020, Kohl’s subleased its store to At Home and remains obligated under its lease which expires in January 2031.We may be unable to renew leases or relet space as leases expire.When our tenants decide not to renew their leases upon their expiration, we may not be able to relet the space. Even if tenants do renew or we can relet the space, the terms of renewal or reletting, considering among other things, the cost of improvements to the property and leasing commissions, may be less favorable than the terms in the expired leases. In addition, changes in space utilization by our tenants may impact our ability to renew or relet space without the need to incur substantial costs in renovating or redesigning the internal configuration of the relevant property. If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the space at similar rates or if we incur substantial costs in renewing or reletting the space, our cash flow and ability to service debt obligations and pay dividends and distributions to stockholders could be adversely affected.  731 Lexington Avenue accounts for a substantial portion of our revenues.  Loss of or damage to the building would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.731 Lexington Avenue accounted for revenue of $153,797,000, $151,834,000 and $148,324,000 in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, representing approximately 68%, 65% and 64% of our total revenues in each year, respectively.  Loss of or damage to the building in excess of our insurance coverage, including as a result of a terrorist attack, would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Bloomberg represents a significant portion of our revenues.  Loss of Bloomberg as a tenant or deterioration in Bloomberg’s credit quality could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Bloomberg accounted for revenue of $109,113,000, $107,356,000 and $105,224,000 in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, representing approximately 48%, 46% and 46% of our total revenues in each year, respectively.  No other tenant accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues.  If we were to lose Bloomberg as a tenant, or if Bloomberg were to be unable to fulfill its obligations under its lease, it would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.10The occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in our cyber security, as well as other disruptions of our IT networks and related systems, could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information, and/or damage to our business relationships or reputation, all of which could negatively impact our financial results.We face risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons who access our systems from inside or outside our organization, and other significant disruptions of our IT networks and related systems. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Although we have not experienced cyber incidents that are individually, or in the aggregate, material, we have experienced cyber attacks in the past, which have thus far been mitigated by preventative, detective, and responsive measures that we have put in place. Our IT networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations (including managing our building systems) and, in some cases, may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants. Although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Unauthorized parties, whether within or outside our company, may disrupt or gain access to our systems, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through human error, misfeasance, fraud, trickery, or other forms of deceit, including break-ins, use of stolen credentials, social engineering, phishing, computer viruses or other malicious codes, and similar means of unauthorized and destructive tampering. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed to not be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. A security breach or other significant disruption involving our IT networks and related systems could disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our tenants; result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or others, which others could use to compete against us or which could expose us to damage claims by third-parties for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; result in our inability to maintain the building systems relied upon by our tenants for the efficient use of their leased space; require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result; subject us to litigation claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, fines, penalties, governmental investigations and enforcement actions or termination of leases or other agreements; or damage our reputation among our tenants and investors generally. Any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. A cyber attack or systems failure could interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting requirements, which could adversely affect us. A cyber attack could also compromise the confidential information of our employees, tenants, customers and vendors. A successful attack could disrupt and materially affect our business operations, including damaging relationships with tenants, customers and vendors. Any compromise of our information security systems could also result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, loss or misuse of the information (which may be confidential, proprietary and/or commercially sensitive in nature) and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business. 11Some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance.We maintain general liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and per property, and all-risk property and rental value insurance coverage with limits of $1.7 billion per occurrence, including coverage for acts of terrorism, with sub-limits for certain perils such as floods and earthquakes on each of our properties. Fifty Ninth Street Insurance Company, LLC (“FNSIC”), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism, including nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) acts, as defined by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended to date and which has been extended through December 2027.  Coverage for acts of terrorism (including NBCR acts) is up to $1.7 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate.  Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to FNSIC.  For NBCR acts, FNSIC is responsible for a $268,000 deductible and 20% of the balance of a covered loss, and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining 80% of a covered loss.  We are ultimately responsible for any loss incurred by FNSIC. We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism or other events.  However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future.  We are responsible for uninsured losses and for deductibles and losses in excess of our insurance coverage, which could be material. Our mortgage loans are non-recourse to us and contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance.  Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future.  Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain, it could adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance our properties. Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs.The ADA generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, meet certain Federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons.  Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the Federal government or the award of damages to private litigants and/or legal fees to their counsel.  If, under the ADA, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the amount of cash available for distribution to stockholders.Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements.  If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards.  We do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations. Changes in the method pursuant to which the LIBOR rates are determined and phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may affect our financial results.The chief executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), announced that the FCA intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. In response, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized the Alternative Reference Rates Committee which identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as its preferred alternative to USD-LIBOR in derivatives and other financial contracts. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, including when LIBOR will cease to be available or when there will be sufficient liquidity in the SOFR markets. We have outstanding debt with variable rates based on LIBOR. In the transition from the use of LIBOR to SOFR or other alternatives, the level of interest payments we incur may change. In addition, although certain of our LIBOR based obligations provide for alternative methods of calculating the related interest rate payable (including transition to an alternative benchmark rate) if LIBOR is not reported, uncertainty as to the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher than, lower than or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the interest rates and/or payments that would have been made on our obligations if LIBOR was available in its current form. Use of alternative interest rates or other LIBOR reforms could result in increased volatility or a tightening of credit markets which could adversely affect our ability to obtain cost-effective financing.12We may incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and environmental contamination may impair our ability to lease and/or sell real estate.Our operations and properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment, including air and water quality, hazardous or toxic substances and health and safety.  Under some environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances released at a property.  The owner or operator may also be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage or personal injuries and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by those parties because of the contamination.  These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the release of the substances or caused the release.  The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may also impair our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.  Other laws and regulations govern indoor and outdoor air quality including those that can require the abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials in the event of damage, demolition, renovation or remodeling and govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air.  The maintenance and removal of lead paint and certain electrical equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are also regulated by federal and state laws.  We are also subject to risks associated with human exposure to chemical or biological contaminants such as molds, pollens, viruses and bacteria which, above certain levels, can be alleged to be connected to allergic or other health effects and symptoms in susceptible individuals.  We could incur fines for environmental compliance and be held liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to the foregoing regulated substances or related claims arising out of environmental contamination or human exposure to contamination at or from our properties. Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment.  To date, these environmental assessments have not revealed any environmental condition material to our business.  However, identification of new compliance concerns or undiscovered areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, human exposure to contamination or changes in clean-up or compliance requirements could result in significant costs to us. In addition, we may become subject to costs or taxes, or increases therein, associated with natural resource or energy usage (such as a “carbon tax”).  These costs or taxes could increase our operating costs and decrease the cash available to pay our obligations or distribute to stockholders.We face risks associated with our tenants being designated “Prohibited Persons” by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and similar requirements. Pursuant to Executive Order 13224 and other laws, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury (“OFAC”) maintains a list of persons designated as terrorists or who are otherwise blocked or banned (“Prohibited Persons”) from conducting business or engaging in transactions in the United States and thereby restricts our doing business with such persons. In addition, our leases, loans and other agreements may require us to comply with OFAC and related requirements, and any failure to do so may result in a breach of such agreements.  If a tenant or other party with whom we conduct business is placed on the OFAC list or is otherwise a party with whom we are prohibited from doing business, we may be required to terminate the lease or other agreement or face other penalties.  Any such termination could result in a loss of revenue or otherwise negatively affect our financial results and cash flows.WE MAY ACQUIRE OR SELL ASSETS OR DEVELOP PROPERTIES.  OUR FAILURE OR INABILITY TO CONSUMMATE THESE TRANSACTIONS OR MANAGE THE RESULTS OF THESE TRANSACTIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.We may acquire, develop, or redevelop properties and this may create risks.Although our stated business strategy is not to engage in acquisitions, we may acquire or develop properties when we believe that an acquisition or development project is otherwise consistent with our business strategy.  We may not succeed in (i) developing, redeveloping or acquiring properties; (ii) completing these activities on time or within budget; and (iii) leasing or selling developed, redeveloped or acquired properties at amounts sufficient to cover our costs.  Competition in these activities could also significantly increase our costs. Difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert management’s attention. Acquisitions or developments in new markets or types of properties where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in weaker than anticipated performance. We may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that we have begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred.  Furthermore, we may be exposed to the liabilities of properties acquired, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition. 13We are exposed to risks associated with property redevelopment and repositioning that could adversely affect us, including our financial condition and results of operations.We continue to engage in redevelopment and repositioning activities with respect to our properties, and, accordingly, we are subject to certain risks, which could adversely affect us, including our financial condition and results of operations. These risks include, without limitation, (i) the availability and pricing of financing on favorable terms or at all; (ii) the availability and timely receipt of zoning and other regulatory approvals; (iii) the potential for the fluctuation of occupancy rates and rents at redeveloped properties, which may result in our investment not being profitable; (iv) start up, repositioning and redevelopment costs may be higher than anticipated; (v) cost overruns and untimely completion of construction (including risks beyond our control, such as weather or labor conditions, or material shortages); (vi) the potential that we may fail to recover expenses already incurred if we abandon development or redevelopment opportunities after we begin to explore them; (vii) the potential that we may expend funds on and devote management time to projects which we do not complete; (viii) the inability to lease a property on schedule or at all, resulting in increased construction or redevelopment costs; and (ix) the possibility that properties will be leased at below expected rental rates. These risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses and could prevent the initiation or the completion of redevelopment activities, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, the market value of our common shares and ability to satisfy our principal and interest obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders.It may be difficult to sell real estate quickly, which may limit our flexibility.Real estate investments are relatively illiquid. Consequently, we may have limited ability to dispose of assets in our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions which could have an adverse effect on our sources of working capital and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations.  We have an investment in marketable equity securities.  The value of this investment may decline as a result of operating performance or economic or market conditions.We have an investment in The Macerich Company (“Macerich”), a retail shopping center company.  As of December 31, 2019, this investment had a carrying amount of $14,409,000. A decline in the value of this investment due to, among other reasons, Macerich’s operating performance or economic or market conditions, would result in recognized GAAP losses, which could be material. OUR ORGANIZATIONAL AND FINANCIAL STRUCTURE GIVES RISE TO OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL RISKS.Substantially all of our assets are owned by subsidiaries.  We depend on dividends and distributions from these subsidiaries.  The creditors of these subsidiaries are entitled to amounts payable to them by the subsidiaries before the subsidiaries may pay any dividends or distributions to us.Substantially all of our properties and assets are held through our subsidiaries.  We depend on cash distributions and dividends from our subsidiaries for substantially all of our cash flow.  The creditors of each of our direct and indirect subsidiaries are entitled to payment of that subsidiary’s obligations to them when due and payable before that subsidiary may make distributions or dividends to us.  Thus, our ability to pay dividends, if any, to our security holders depends on our subsidiaries’ ability to first satisfy their obligations to their creditors and our ability to satisfy our obligations, if any, to our creditors. In addition, our participation in any distribution of the assets of any of our direct or indirect subsidiaries upon the liquidation, reorganization or insolvency of the subsidiary, is only after the claims of the creditors, including trade creditors, and preferred security holders, if any, of the applicable direct or indirect subsidiaries are satisfied. Our existing financing documents contain covenants and restrictions that may restrict our operational and financial flexibility.As of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding mortgage indebtedness of $974,836,000, secured by three of our properties.  These mortgages contain covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness on these properties, provide for lender approval of tenants’ leases in certain circumstances, and provide for yield maintenance or defeasance premiums to prepay them.  These mortgages may significantly restrict our operational and financial flexibility.  In addition, if we were to fail to perform our obligations under existing indebtedness or become insolvent or were liquidated, secured creditors would be entitled to payment in full from the proceeds of the sale of the pledged assets prior to any proceeds being paid to other creditors or to any holders of our securities.  In such an event, it is possible that we would have insufficient assets remaining to make payments to other creditors or to any holders of our securities. 14We have a substantial amount of indebtedness that could affect our future operations.As of December 31, 2019, total debt outstanding was $974,836,000. We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service. Our debt service costs generally will not be reduced if developments in the market or at our properties, such as the entry of new competitors or the loss of major tenants, cause a reduction in the income from our properties. Should such events occur, our operations may be adversely affected. If a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from such property is insufficient to pay that indebtedness, the property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value. We have outstanding debt, and the amount of debt and its cost may increase and refinancing may not be available on acceptable terms.As of December 31, 2019, total debt outstanding was $974,836,000 and our ratio of total debt to total enterprise value was 41.2%.  “Enterprise value” means the market equity value of our common stock, plus debt, less cash and cash equivalents at such date.  In addition, we have significant debt service obligations.  For the year ended December 31, 2019, our scheduled cash payments for principal and interest were $34,669,000.  In the future, we may incur additional debt, and thus increase the ratio of total debt to total enterprise value.  If our level of indebtedness increases, there may be an increased risk of default which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, in a rising interest rate environment, the cost of refinancing our existing debt and any new debt or market rate security or instrument may increase.  Continued uncertainty in the equity and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms or at all, which may negatively affect our ability to refinance our debt.    We might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT, and may be required to pay federal income taxes at corporate rates.Although we believe that we will remain organized and will continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we might fail to remain qualified.  Qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes is governed by highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and depends on various facts and circumstances that are not entirely within our control.  In addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the relevant tax laws and/or the federal income tax consequences of qualifying as a REIT. If, with respect to any taxable year, we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT and do not qualify under statutory relief provisions, we could not deduct distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would have to pay federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. The federal income tax payable would include any applicable alternative minimum tax. If we had to pay federal income tax, the amount of money available to distribute to stockholders and pay our indebtedness would be reduced for the year or years involved, and we would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders in that taxable year and in future years until we were able to qualify as a REIT and did so. In addition, we would also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost, unless we were entitled to relief under the relevant statutory provisions. We may face possible adverse changes in federal tax laws, which may result in an increase in our tax liability.At any time, the U.S. federal income tax laws governing REITs or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended. We cannot predict if or when any new U.S. federal income tax law, regulation, or administrative interpretation, or any amendment to any existing U.S. federal income tax law, Treasury regulation or administrative interpretation, will be adopted, promulgated or become effective and any such law, regulation, or interpretation may take effect retroactively. Alexander’s, its taxable REIT subsidiaries, and our security holders could be adversely affected by any such change in, or any new, U.S. federal income tax law, Treasury regulation or administrative interpretation.15We may face possible adverse state and local tax audits and changes in state and local tax law.Because we are organized and qualify as a REIT, we are generally not subject to federal income taxes, but we are subject to certain state and local taxes. In the normal course of business, certain entities through which we own real estate either have undergone, or are currently undergoing, tax audits. Although we believe that we have substantial arguments in favor of our positions in the ongoing audits, in some instances there is no controlling precedent or interpretive guidance on the specific point at issue. There can be no assurance that ongoing and future audits will not occur with increased frequency or that the ultimate result of such audits will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.From time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. A shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we operate may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends and distributions to our stockholders.Loss of our key personnel could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our common stock.We are dependent on the efforts of Steven Roth, our Chief Executive Officer.  Although we believe that we could find a replacement, the loss of his services could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our common stock.ALEXANDER’S CHARTER DOCUMENTS AND APPLICABLE LAW MAY HINDER ANY ATTEMPT TO ACQUIRE US.Provisions in Alexander’s certificate of incorporation and by laws, as well as provisions of the Code and Delaware corporate law, may delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or a tender offer, even if such action might be beneficial to stockholders, and limit the stockholders’ opportunity to receive a potential premium for their shares of common stock over then prevailing market prices. Primarily to facilitate maintenance of its qualification as a REIT, Alexander’s certificate of incorporation generally prohibits ownership, directly, indirectly or beneficially, by any single stockholder of more than 9.9% of the outstanding shares of preferred stock of any class or 4.9% of outstanding common stock of any class.  The Board of Directors may waive or modify these ownership limits with respect to one or more persons if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of these limits will not jeopardize Alexander’s status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.  In addition, the Board of Directors has, subject to certain conditions and limitations, exempted Vornado and certain of its affiliates from these ownership limitations.  Stock owned in violation of these ownership limits will be subject to the loss of rights and other restrictions.  These ownership limits may have the effect of inhibiting or impeding a change in control. Alexander’s Board of Directors is divided into three classes of directors.  Directors of each class are chosen for three-year staggered terms.  Staggered terms of directors may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management, even though changes in management or a change in control might be in the best interest of our stockholders. In addition, Alexander’s charter documents authorize the Board of Directors to: •cause Alexander’s to issue additional authorized but unissued common stock or preferred stock;•classify or reclassify, in one or more series, any unissued preferred stock; and•set the preferences, rights and other terms of any classified or reclassified stock that Alexander’s issues. The Board of Directors could establish a series of preferred stock with terms that could delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Alexander’s or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our   stockholders, although the Board of Directors does not, at present, intend to establish a series of preferred stock of this kind.  Alexander’s charter documents contain other provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of the Company or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. In addition, Vornado, Interstate and its three general partners (each of whom are both trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexander’s) together beneficially own approximately 58.5% of our outstanding shares of common stock.  This degree of ownership is likely to reduce the possibility of a tender offer or an attempt to change control of the Company by a third party. 16We may change our policies without obtaining the approval of our stockholders.Our operating and financial policies, including our policies with respect to acquisitions of real estate or other assets, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and dividends, are exclusively determined by our Board of Directors.  Accordingly, our stockholders do not control these policies.OUR OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE AND RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS MAY GIVE RISE TO CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.Steven Roth, Vornado and Interstate may exercise substantial influence over us.  They and some of our other directors and officers have interests or positions in other entities that may compete with us.As of December 31, 2019, Interstate and its partners owned approximately 7.1% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and approximately 26.1% of our outstanding common stock.  Steven Roth, David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr. are the partners of Interstate.  Mr. Roth is the Chairman of our Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado and the Managing General Partner of Interstate.  Mr. Wight and Mr. Mandelbaum are both trustees of Vornado and members of our Board of Directors.  In addition, Vornado manages and leases the real estate assets of Interstate. As of December 31, 2019, Vornado owned 32.4% of our outstanding common stock, in addition to the 26.1% owned by Interstate and its partners.  In addition to the relationships described in the immediately preceding paragraph, Dr. Richard West is a trustee of Vornado and a member of our Board of Directors and Joseph Macnow, our Treasurer, is the Executive Vice President - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer of Vornado. Matthew Iocco is our Chief Financial Officer and the Executive Vice President - Chief Accounting Officer of Vornado.   Because of their overlapping interests, Vornado, Mr. Roth, Interstate and the other individuals noted in the preceding paragraphs may have substantial influence over Alexander’s, and on the outcome of any matters submitted to Alexander’s stockholders for approval.  In addition, certain decisions concerning our operations or financial structure may present conflicts of interest among Vornado, Messrs. Roth, Mandelbaum and Wight and Interstate and other security holders.  Vornado, Mr. Roth and Interstate may, in the future, engage in a wide variety of activities in the real estate business which may result in conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting us, such as, which of these entities or persons, if any, may take advantage of potential business opportunities, the business focus of these entities, the types of properties and geographic locations in which these entities make investments, potential competition between business activities conducted, or sought to be conducted, by us, competition for properties and tenants, possible corporate transactions such as acquisitions, and other strategic decisions affecting the future of these entities. There may be conflicts of interest between Vornado, its affiliates and us.Vornado manages, develops and leases our properties under agreements that have one-year terms expiring in March of each year, which are automatically renewable.  Because we share common senior management with Vornado and because four of the trustees of Vornado are on our Board of Directors, the terms of the foregoing agreements and any future agreements may not be comparable to those we could have negotiated with an unaffiliated third party. For a description of Interstate’s ownership of Vornado and Alexander’s, see “Steven Roth, Vornado and Interstate may exercise substantial influence over us.  They and some of our other directors and officers have interests or positions in other entities that may compete with us.” above.17THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF ALEXANDER’S COMMON STOCK AND THE MARKET FOR THOSE SHARES GIVE RISE TO VARIOUS RISKS.The trading price of our common shares has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate.The trading price of our common shares has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate widely as a result of several factors, many of which are outside of our control.  In addition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies.  These broad market fluctuations have in the past and may in the future adversely affect the market price of our common shares.  Among the factors that could affect the price of our common shares are:•our financial condition and performance;•the financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies or defaults;•actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;•our dividend policy;•the reputation of REITs and real estate investments generally and the attractiveness of REIT equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate companies, and fixed income securities;•uncertainty and volatility in the equity and credit markets;•fluctuations in interest rates;•changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to our securities or those of other REITs;•failure to meet analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates;•speculation in the press or investment community;•strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;•the extent of institutional investor interest in us;•the extent of short-selling of our common shares and the shares of our competitors;•fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;•general financial and economic market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for REITs and other real estate related companies;•domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance; •changes in tax laws and rules; and•all other risk factors addressed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.A significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for stockholders.Alexander’s has additional shares of its common stock available for future issuance, which could decrease the market price of the common stock currently outstanding.The interest of our current stockholders could be diluted if we issue additional equity securities.  As of December 31, 2019, we had authorized but unissued 4,826,550 shares of common stock, par value of $1.00 per share and 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share; of which 11,408 shares of common stock are reserved for issuance upon redemption of the deferred stock units previously granted to our Board of Directors.  In addition, 494,379 shares are available for future grant under the terms of our 2016 Omnibus Stock Plan.  These awards may be granted in the form of options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, deferred stock units, or other equity-based interests, and if granted, would reduce that number of shares available for future grants, provided however that an award that may be settled only in cash, would not reduce the number of shares available under the plan.  We cannot predict the impact that future issuances of common or preferred stock or any exercise of outstanding options or grants of additional equity-based interests would have on the market price of our common stock"
6,ALX,ALEXANDER'S INC,2019-02-11,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSMaterial factors that may adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition are summarized below.  The risks and uncertainties described herein may not be the only ones we face.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition. See “Forward-Looking Statements” contained herein on page 4.OUR INVESTMENTS ARE CONCENTRATED IN THE GREATER NEW YORK CITY METROPOLITAN AREA. CIRCUMSTANCES AFFECTING THIS AREA GENERALLY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.All of our properties are in the greater New York City metropolitan area and are affected by the economic cycles and risks inherent in that area.All of our revenues come from properties located in the greater New York City metropolitan area.  Real estate markets are subject to economic downturns and we cannot predict how economic conditions will impact this market in either the short or long term.  Declines in the economy or declines in the real estate market in this area could hurt our financial performance and the value of our properties.  In addition to the factors affecting the national economic condition generally, the factors affecting economic conditions in this area include: •financial performance and productivity of the media, advertising, professional services, financial, technology, retail, insurance and real estate industries;•business layoffs or downsizing;•industry slowdowns;•relocations of businesses;•changing demographics;•increased telecommuting and use of alternative work places;•changes in the number of domestic and international tourists to our markets (including, as a result of changes in the relative strengths of world currencies);•infrastructure quality; •changes in the rates or treatment of the deductibility of state and local taxes; and•any oversupply of, or reduced demand for, real estate.It is impossible for us to assess the future effects of trends in the economic and investment climates of the greater New York City metropolitan region, and more generally of the United States, on the real estate market in this area.  Local, national or global economic downturns could negatively affect our business and profitability.We are subject to risks that affect the general and New York City retail environments.Certain of our properties are New York City retail properties.  As such, these properties are affected by the general and New York City retail environments, including the level of consumer spending and consumer confidence, change in relative strengths of world currencies, the threat of terrorism, increasing competition from discount retailers, outlet malls, retail websites and catalog companies and the impact of technological change upon the retail environment generally. These factors could adversely affect the financial condition of our retail tenants, or result in the bankruptcy of such tenants, and the willingness of retailers to lease space in our retail locations. Terrorist attacks may adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to generate cash flow.All of our properties are located in the greater New York City metropolitan area, and our most significant property, 731 Lexington Avenue, is located on Lexington Avenue and 59th Street in Manhattan.  In response to a terrorist attack or the perceived threat of terrorism, tenants in this area may choose to relocate their businesses to less populated, lower-profile areas of the United States that may be perceived to be less likely targets of future terrorist activity and fewer customers may choose to patronize businesses in this area. This, in turn, could trigger a decrease in the demand for space in these markets, which could increase vacancies in our properties and force us to lease our properties on less favorable terms. Furthermore, we may experience increased costs for security, equipment and personnel.  As a result, the value of our properties and the level of our revenues could decline materially. 7Natural disasters and the effects of climate change could have a concentrated impact on the area which we operate and could adversely impact our results.Our investments are in the greater New York City metropolitan area and since they are concentrated along the Eastern Seaboard, natural disasters, including hurricanes, could impact our properties.  Potentially adverse consequences of “global warming” could similarly have an impact on our properties. Over time, these conditions could result in declining demand for office space in our buildings or the inability of us to operate the buildings at all. Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) property insurance on terms we find acceptable, increasing the cost of energy at our properties and requiring us to expend funds as we seek to repair and protect our properties against such risks. The incurrence of these losses, costs or business interruptions may adversely affect our operating and financial results.REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS’ VALUE AND INCOME FLUCTUATE DUE TO VARIOUS FACTORS.The value of real estate fluctuates depending on conditions in the general economy and the real estate business.  These conditions may also adversely impact our revenues and cash flows. The factors that affect the value of our real estate include, among other things: •global, national, regional and local economic conditions;•competition from other available space;•local conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area;•how well we manage our properties;•the development and/or redevelopment of our properties;•changes in market rental rates;•the timing and costs associated with property improvements and rentals;•whether we are able to pass all or portions of any increases in operating costs through to tenants;•changes in real estate taxes and other expenses;  •whether tenants and users such as customers and shoppers consider a property attractive;•changes in consumer preferences adversely affecting retailers and retail store values;•changes in space utilization by our tenants due to technology, economic conditions and business environment;•the financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies or defaults;•trends in office real estate;•the impact on our retail tenants and demand for retail space at our properties due to increased competition from online shopping;•availability of financing on acceptable terms or at all;•inflation or deflation;•fluctuations in interest rates;•our ability to obtain adequate insurance;•changes in zoning laws and taxation;•government regulation;•consequences of any armed conflict involving, or terrorist attack against, the United States or individual acts of                      violence in public spaces, including retail centers;•potential liability under environmental or other laws or regulations;•natural disasters;•general competitive factors; and•climate changes. The rents we receive and the occupancy levels at our properties may decline as a result of adverse changes in any of these factors.  If our rental revenues and/or occupancy levels decline, we generally would expect to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and for distribution to our stockholders.  In addition, some of our major expenses, including mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs generally do not decline when the related rents decline. 8Capital markets and economic conditions can materially affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations as well as the value of an investment in our debt and equity securities.There are many factors that can affect the value of our equity securities and any debt securities we may issue in the future, including the state of the capital markets and economy.  Demand for office and retail space may decline nationwide due to an economic downturn, bankruptcies, downsizing, layoffs and cost cutting.  Government action or inaction may adversely affect the state of the capital markets.  The cost and availability of credit may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads, which may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including our results of operations, and the liquidity and financial condition of our tenants.  Our inability or the inability of our tenants to timely refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs may materially affect our financial condition and results of operations and the value of our equity securities and any debt securities we may issue in the future. U.S. federal tax reform legislation now and in the future could affect REITs generally, the geographic markets in which we operate, the trading of our shares and our results of operations, both positively and negatively, in ways that are difficult to anticipate.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “2017 Act”) represented sweeping tax reform legislation that made significant changes to corporate and individual tax rates and the calculation of taxes, as well as international tax rules. As a REIT, we are generally not required to pay federal taxes otherwise applicable to regular corporations if we comply with the various tax regulations governing REITs. Shareholders, however, are generally required to pay taxes on REIT dividends. The 2017 Act and future tax reform legislation could impact our share price or how shareholders and potential investors view an investment in REITs.  For example, the decrease in corporate tax rates in the 2017 Act could decrease the attractiveness of the REIT structure relative to companies that are not organized as REITs. In addition, while certain elements of the 2017 Act do not impact us directly as a REIT, they could impact the geographic markets in which we operate as well as our tenants in ways, both positive and negative, that are difficult to anticipate. For example, the limitation in the 2017 Act on the deductibility of certain state and local taxes may make operating in jurisdictions that impose such taxes at higher rates less desirable than operating in jurisdictions imposing such taxes at lower rates.  The overall impact of the 2017 Act also depends on the future interpretations and regulations that may be issued by U.S. tax authorities, and it is possible that future guidance could adversely impact us.Real estate is a competitive business.We compete with a large number of real estate property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments.  Principal factors of competition are rents charged, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and the quality of services provided.  Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the global, national and local economies, the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation, population and employment trends, zoning laws, and our ability to lease, sublease or sell our properties, at profitable levels.  We may be adversely affected by trends in office real estate.Telecommuting, flexible work schedules, open workplaces and teleconferencing are becoming more common. These practices enable businesses to reduce their office space requirements. There is also an increasing trend among some businesses to utilize shared office spaces and co-working spaces. A continuation of these trends could, over time, erode the overall demand for office space and, in turn, place downward pressure on occupancy, rental rates and property valuations.We depend on leasing space to tenants on economically favorable terms and collecting rent from tenants who may not be able to pay.Our financial results depend significantly on leasing space in our properties to tenants on economically favorable terms.  In addition, because a majority of our income is derived from renting real property, our income, funds available to pay indebtedness and for distributions to stockholders will decrease if certain of our tenants cannot pay their rent or if we are not able to maintain our occupancy levels on favorable terms.  If a tenant does not pay its rent, we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and might incur substantial legal and other costs. During periods of economic adversity for retailers or otherwise, there may be an increase in the number of tenants that cannot pay their rent, become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, all of which can result in an increase in vacancy rates and lower income and funds available to pay indebtedness and for distributions to stockholders. 9Bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants may decrease our revenues, net income and available cash.From time to time, some of our tenants have declared bankruptcy, and other tenants may declare bankruptcy or become insolvent in the future.  The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant could cause us to have difficulty leasing the remainder of the affected property.  Our leases generally do not contain restrictions designed to ensure the creditworthiness of our tenants.  As a result, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant or multiple tenants could result in a lower level of net income and funds available to pay our indebtedness or make distributions to stockholders. We depend upon anchor tenants to attract shoppers at our Rego Park I and II retail properties and decisions made by these tenants, or adverse developments in the businesses of these tenants, could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our Rego Park I and II retail properties are anchored by well-known department stores and other tenants who generate shopping traffic.  The value of these properties would be adversely affected if our anchor tenants failed to meet their contractual obligations, sought concessions in order to continue operations or ceased their operations, including as a result of bankruptcy.  If the level of sales of stores operating in our properties were to decline significantly due to economic conditions, increased competition from  online shopping, closing of anchors or for other reasons, tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges.  In the event of a default by a tenant or anchor, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord.  Additionally, closure of an anchor or major tenant could result in lease terminations by, or reductions of rent from, other tenants if the other tenants’ leases have co-tenancy clauses. On April 4, 2017, Sears closed its 195,000 square foot store at our Rego Park I shopping center ($10,300,000 of annual revenue). On October 15, 2018, Sears filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy relief and rejected its lease. On January 10, 2019, Kohl’s announced that it plans to close and sublease its 133,000 square foot store at our Rego Park II shopping center; Kohl’s remains obligated to us under its lease which expires in January 2031.We may be unable to renew leases or relet space as leases expire.When our tenants decide not to renew their leases upon their expiration, we may not be able to relet the space. Even if tenants do renew or we can relet the space, the terms of renewal or reletting, taking into account among other things, the cost of improvements to the property and leasing commissions, may be less favorable than the terms in the expired leases. In addition, changes in space utilization by our tenants may impact our ability to renew or relet space without the need to incur substantial costs in renovating or redesigning the internal configuration of the relevant property. If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the space at similar rates or if we incur substantial costs in renewing or reletting the space, our cash flow and ability to service debt obligations and pay dividends and distributions to stockholders could be adversely affected.  731 Lexington Avenue accounts for a substantial portion of our revenues.  Loss of or damage to the building would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.731 Lexington Avenue accounted for revenue of $151,834,000, $148,324,000 and $147,567,000 in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, representing approximately 65%, 64% and 65% of our total revenues in each year, respectively.  Loss of or damage to the building in excess of our insurance coverage, including as a result of a terrorist attack, would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Bloomberg represents a significant portion of our revenues.  Loss of Bloomberg as a tenant or deterioration in Bloomberg’s credit quality could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Bloomberg accounted for revenue of $107,356,000, $105,224,000 and $104,590,000 in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, representing approximately 46% of our total revenues in each year.  No other tenant accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues.  If we were to lose Bloomberg as a tenant, or if Bloomberg were to be unable to fulfill its obligations under its lease, it would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We face risks associated with our tenants being designated “Prohibited Persons” by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and similar requirements. Pursuant to Executive Order 13224 and other laws, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury (“OFAC”) maintains a list of persons designated as terrorists or who are otherwise blocked or banned (“Prohibited Persons”) from conducting business or engaging in transactions in the United States and thereby restricts our doing business with such persons. In addition, our leases, loans and other agreements may require us to comply with OFAC and related requirements, and any failure to  do so may result in a breach of such agreements.  If a tenant or other party with whom we conduct business is placed on the OFAC list or is otherwise a party with whom we are prohibited from doing business, we may be required to terminate the lease or other agreement or face other penalties.  Any such termination could result in a loss of revenue or otherwise negatively affect our financial results and cash flows.10Our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures. Despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems, our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including computer viruses, unauthorized access, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication failures.  Any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business.  We may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions. The occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in our cyber security, could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information, and/or damage to our business relationships or reputation, all of which could negatively impact our financial results.We face risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons who access our systems from inside or outside our organization, and other significant disruptions of our IT networks and related systems. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Although we have not experienced cyber incidents that are individually, or in the aggregate, material, we have experienced cyber attacks in the past, which have thus far been mitigated by preventative, detective, and responsive measures that we have put in place. Our IT networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations (including managing our building systems) and, in some cases, may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants. Although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Unauthorized parties, whether within or outside our company, may disrupt or gain access to our systems, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through human error, misfeasance, fraud, trickery, or other forms of deceit, including break-ins, use of stolen credentials, social engineering, phishing, computer viruses or other malicious codes, and similar means of unauthorized and destructive tampering. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed to not be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. A security breach or other significant disruption involving our IT networks and related systems could disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our tenants; result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or others, which others could use to compete against us or which could expose us to damage claims by third-parties for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; result in our inability to maintain the building systems relied upon by our tenants for the efficient use of their leased space; require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result; subject us to litigation claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, fines, penalties, governmental investigations and enforcement actions or termination of leases or other agreements; or damage our reputation among our tenants and investors generally. Any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. A cyber attack could interfere with our ability to comply with the financial reporting requirements, which could adversely affect us. A cyber attack could also compromise the confidential information of our employees, tenants, customers and vendors. A successful attack could disrupt and materially affect our business operations, including damaging relationships with tenants, customers and vendors. Any compromise of our information security systems could also result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, loss or misuse of the information (which may be confidential, proprietary and/or commercially sensitive in nature) and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business.11We may incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and environmental contamination may impair our ability to lease and/or sell real estate.Our operations and properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment, including air and water quality, hazardous or toxic substances and health and safety.  Under some environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances released at a property.  The owner or operator may also be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage or personal injuries and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by those parties because of the contamination.  These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the release of the substances or caused the release.  The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may also impair our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.  Other laws and regulations govern indoor and outdoor air quality including those that can require the abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials in the event of damage, demolition, renovation or remodeling and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air.  The maintenance and removal of lead paint and certain electrical equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are also regulated by federal and state laws.  We are also subject to risks associated with human exposure to chemical or biological contaminants such as molds, pollens, viruses and bacteria which, above certain levels, can be alleged to be connected to allergic or other health effects and symptoms in susceptible individuals.  We could incur fines for environmental compliance and be held liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to the foregoing regulated substances or related claims arising out of environmental contamination or human exposure to contamination at or from our properties. Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment.  To date, these environmental assessments have not revealed any environmental condition material to our business.  However, identification of new compliance concerns or undiscovered areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, human exposure to contamination or changes in clean-up or compliance requirements could result in significant costs to us. In addition, we may become subject to costs or taxes, or increases therein, associated with natural resource or energy usage (such as a “carbon tax”).  These costs or taxes could increase our operating costs and decrease the cash available to pay our obligations or distribute to equity holders. Some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance.We maintain general liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and per property, and all-risk property and rental value insurance coverage with limits of $1.7 billion per occurrence, including coverage for acts of terrorism, with sub-limits for certain perils such as floods and earthquakes on each of our properties. Fifty Ninth Street Insurance Company, LLC (“FNSIC”), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism, including nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) acts, as defined by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act, which expires in December 2020.  Coverage for acts of terrorism (including NBCR acts) is up to $1.7 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate.  Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to FNSIC.  For NBCR acts, FNSIC is responsible for a $323,000 deductible and 19% of the balance of a covered loss, and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining 81% of a covered loss.  We are ultimately responsible for any loss incurred by FNSIC. We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism or other events.  However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future.  We are responsible for uninsured losses and for deductibles and losses in excess of our insurance coverage, which could be material. Our mortgage loans are non-recourse to us and contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance.  Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future.  Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain, it could adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance our properties. 12Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs.The ADA generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons.  Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants and/or legal fees to their counsel.  If, under the ADA, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the amount of cash available for distribution to stockholders.Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements.  If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards.  We do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations. Changes in the method pursuant to which the LIBOR rates are determined and potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may affect our financial results.The chief executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, has recently announced that the FCA intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Furthermore, in the United States, efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates include proposals by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. On August 24, 2017, the Federal Reserve Board requested public comment on a proposal by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in cooperation with the Office of Financial Research, to produce three new reference rates intended to serve as alternatives to LIBOR. These alternative rates are based on overnight repurchase agreement transactions secured by U.S. Treasury Securities. Any changes announced by the FCA, other regulators or any other successor governance or oversight body, or future changes adopted by such body, in the method pursuant to which the LIBOR rates are determined may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in the reported LIBOR rates. If that were to occur, the level of interest payments we incur may change.  In addition, although certain of our LIBOR based obligations provide for alternative methods of calculating the interest rate payable on certain of our obligations if LIBOR is not reported, which include requesting certain rates from major reference banks in London or New York, or alternatively using LIBOR for the immediately preceding interest period or using the initial interest rate, as applicable, uncertainty as to the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher than, lower than or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the interest rates and/or payments that would have been made on our obligations if LIBOR rate was available in its current form.WE MAY ACQUIRE OR SELL ASSETS OR DEVELOP PROPERTIES.  OUR FAILURE OR INABILITY TO CONSUMMATE THESE TRANSACTIONS OR MANAGE THE RESULTS OF THESE TRANSACTIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.We may acquire, develop, or redevelop properties and this may create risks.Although our stated business strategy is not to engage in acquisitions, we may acquire or develop properties when we believe that an acquisition or development project is otherwise consistent with our business strategy.  We may not succeed in (i) developing, redeveloping or acquiring properties; (ii) completing these activities on time or within budget; and (iii) leasing or selling developed, redeveloped or acquired properties at amounts sufficient to cover our costs.  Competition in these activities could also significantly increase our costs. Difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert management’s attention. Acquisitions or developments in new markets or types of properties where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in weaker than anticipated performance. We may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that we have begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred.  Furthermore, we may be exposed to the liabilities of properties acquired, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition. It may be difficult to buy and sell real estate quickly, which may limit our flexibility.Real estate investments are relatively difficult to buy and sell quickly.  Consequently, we may have limited ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.  Moreover, our ability to buy, sell, or finance real estate assets may be adversely affected during periods of uncertainty or unfavorable conditions in the credit markets as we, or potential buyers of our assets, may experience difficulty in obtaining financing. 13We have an investment in marketable equity securities.  The value of this investment may decline as a result of operating performance or economic or market conditions.We have an investment in Macerich, a retail shopping center company.  As of December 31, 2018, this investment had a carrying amount of $23,166,000. A decline in the value of this investment due to, among other reasons, Macerich’s operating performance or economic or market conditions, would result in recognized GAAP losses, which could be material. OUR ORGANIZATIONAL AND FINANCIAL STRUCTURE GIVES RISE TO OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL RISKS.Substantially all of our assets are owned by subsidiaries.  We depend on dividends and distributions from these subsidiaries.  The creditors of these subsidiaries are entitled to amounts payable to them by the subsidiaries before the subsidiaries may pay any dividends or distributions to us.Substantially all of our properties and assets are held through our subsidiaries.  We depend on cash distributions and dividends from our subsidiaries for substantially all of our cash flow.  The creditors of each of our direct and indirect subsidiaries are entitled to payment of that subsidiary’s obligations to them when due and payable before that subsidiary may make distributions or dividends to us.  Thus, our ability to pay dividends, if any, to our security holders depends on our subsidiaries’ ability to first satisfy their obligations to their creditors and our ability to satisfy our obligations, if any, to our creditors. In addition, our participation in any distribution of the assets of any of our direct or indirect subsidiaries upon the liquidation, reorganization or insolvency of the subsidiary, is only after the claims of the creditors, including trade creditors, and preferred security holders, if any, of the applicable direct or indirect subsidiaries are satisfied. Our existing financing documents contain covenants and restrictions that may restrict our operational and financial flexibility.As of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding mortgage indebtedness of $1,170,544,000, secured by three of our properties.  These mortgages contain covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness on these properties, provide for lender approval of tenants’ leases in certain circumstances, and provide for yield maintenance or defeasance premiums to prepay them.  These mortgages may significantly restrict our operational and financial flexibility.  In addition, if we were to fail to perform our obligations under existing indebtedness or become insolvent or were liquidated, secured creditors would be entitled to payment in full from the proceeds of the sale of the pledged assets prior to any proceeds being paid to other creditors or to any holders of our securities.  In such an event, it is possible that we would have insufficient assets remaining to make payments to other creditors or to any holders of our securities. We have a substantial amount of indebtedness that could affect our future operations.As of December 31, 2018, total debt outstanding was $1,170,544,000. We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service. Our debt service costs generally will not be reduced if developments in the market or at our properties, such as the entry of new competitors or the loss of major tenants, cause a reduction in the income from our properties. Should such events occur, our operations may be adversely affected. If a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from such property is insufficient to pay that indebtedness, the property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value. We have outstanding debt, and the amount of debt and its cost may increase and refinancing may not be available on acceptable terms.As of December 31, 2018, total debt outstanding was $1,170,544,000 and our ratio of total debt to total enterprise value was 47.9%.  “Enterprise value” means the market equity value of our common stock, plus debt, less cash and cash equivalents at such date.  In addition, we have significant debt service obligations.  For the year ended December 31, 2018, our scheduled cash payments for principal and interest were $41,881,000.  In the future, we may incur additional debt, and thus increase the ratio of total debt to total enterprise value.  If our level of indebtedness increases, there may be an increased risk of default which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, in a rising interest rate environment, the cost of refinancing our existing debt and any new debt or market rate security or instrument may increase.  Continued uncertainty in the equity and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms or at all, which may negatively affect our ability to refinance our debt.    14We might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT, and may be required to pay income taxes at corporate rates.Although we believe that we will remain organized and will continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we might fail to remain qualified.  Qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes is governed by highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and depends on various facts and circumstances that are not entirely within our control.  In addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the relevant tax laws and/or the federal income tax consequences of qualifying as a REIT. If, with respect to any taxable year, we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT and do not qualify under statutory relief provisions, we could not deduct distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would have to pay federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. The federal income tax payable would include any applicable alternative minimum tax. If we had to pay federal income tax, the amount of money available to distribute to stockholders and pay our indebtedness would be reduced for the year or years involved, and we would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders in that taxable year and in future years until we were able to qualify as a REIT and did so. In addition, we would also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost, unless we were entitled to relief under the relevant statutory provisions. We face possible adverse changes in tax laws, which may result in an increase in our tax liability.From time to time changes in tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability.  The shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in recent years may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes.  If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income.  These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for payment of dividends. Loss of our key personnel could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our common stock.We are dependent on the efforts of Steven Roth, our Chief Executive Officer.  Although we believe that we could find a replacement, the loss of his services could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our common stock.15ALEXANDER’S CHARTER DOCUMENTS AND APPLICABLE LAW MAY HINDER ANY ATTEMPT TO ACQUIRE US.Provisions in Alexander’s certificate of incorporation and by laws, as well as provisions of the Code and Delaware corporate law, may delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or a tender offer, even if such action might be beneficial to stockholders, and limit the stockholders’ opportunity to receive a potential premium for their shares of common stock over then prevailing market prices. Primarily to facilitate maintenance of its qualification as a REIT, Alexander’s certificate of incorporation generally prohibits ownership, directly, indirectly or beneficially, by any single stockholder of more than 9.9% of the outstanding shares of preferred stock of any class or 4.9% of outstanding common stock of any class.  The Board of Directors may waive or modify these ownership limits with respect to one or more persons if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of these limits will not jeopardize Alexander’s status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.  In addition, the Board of Directors has, subject to certain conditions and limitations, exempted Vornado and certain of its affiliates from these ownership limitations.  Stock owned in violation of these ownership limits will be subject to the loss of rights and other restrictions.  These ownership limits may have the effect of inhibiting or impeding a change in control. Alexander’s Board of Directors is divided into three classes of directors.  Directors of each class are chosen for three-year staggered terms.  Staggered terms of directors may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management, even though changes in management or a change in control might be in the best interest of our stockholders. In addition, Alexander’s charter documents authorize the Board of Directors to: •cause Alexander’s to issue additional authorized but unissued common stock or preferred stock;•classify or reclassify, in one or more series, any unissued preferred stock; and•set the preferences, rights and other terms of any classified or reclassified stock that Alexander’s issues. The Board of Directors could establish a series of preferred stock with terms that could delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Alexander’s or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our   stockholders, although the Board of Directors does not, at present, intend to establish a series of preferred stock of this kind.  Alexander’s charter documents contain other provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of the Company or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. In addition, Vornado, Interstate and its three general partners (each of whom are both trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexander’s) together beneficially own approximately 58.6% of our outstanding shares of common stock.  This degree of ownership is likely to reduce the possibility of a tender offer or an attempt to change control of the Company by a third party. We may change our policies without obtaining the approval of our stockholders.Our operating and financial policies, including our policies with respect to acquisitions of real estate or other assets, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and dividends, are exclusively determined by our Board of Directors.  Accordingly, our stockholders do not control these policies.16OUR OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE AND RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS MAY GIVE RISE TO CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.Steven Roth, Vornado and Interstate may exercise substantial influence over us.  They and some of our other directors and officers have interests or positions in other entities that may compete with us.As of December 31, 2018, Interstate and its partners owned approximately 7.1% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and approximately 26.2% of our outstanding common stock.  Steven Roth, David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr. are the partners of Interstate.  Mr. Roth is the Chairman of our Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado and the Managing General Partner of Interstate.  Mr. Wight and Mr. Mandelbaum are both trustees of Vornado and members of our Board of Directors.  In addition, Vornado manages and leases the real estate assets of Interstate. As of December 31, 2018, Vornado owned 32.4% of our outstanding common stock, in addition to the 26.2% owned by Interstate and its partners.  In addition to the relationships described in the immediately preceding paragraph, Dr. Richard West is a trustee of Vornado and a member of our Board of Directors and Joseph Macnow, our Treasurer, is the Executive Vice President - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer of Vornado. Matthew Iocco is our Chief Financial Officer and the Executive Vice President - Chief Accounting Officer of Vornado.   Because of their overlapping interests, Vornado, Mr. Roth, Interstate and the other individuals noted in the preceding paragraphs may have substantial influence over Alexander’s, and on the outcome of any matters submitted to Alexander’s stockholders for approval.  In addition, certain decisions concerning our operations or financial structure may present conflicts of interest among Vornado, Messrs. Roth, Mandelbaum and Wight and Interstate and other security holders.  Vornado, Mr. Roth and Interstate may, in the future, engage in a wide variety of activities in the real estate business which may result in conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting us, such as, which of these entities or persons, if any, may take advantage of potential business opportunities, the business focus of these entities, the types of properties and geographic locations in which these entities make investments, potential competition between business activities conducted, or sought to be conducted, by us, competition for properties and tenants, possible corporate transactions such as acquisitions, and other strategic decisions affecting the future of these entities. There may be conflicts of interest between Vornado, its affiliates and us.Vornado manages, develops and leases our properties under agreements that have one-year terms expiring in March of each year, which are automatically renewable.  Because we share common senior management with Vornado and because four of the trustees of Vornado are on our Board of Directors, the terms of the foregoing agreements and any future agreements may not be comparable to those we could have negotiated with an unaffiliated third party. For a description of Interstate’s ownership of Vornado and Alexander’s, see “Steven Roth, Vornado and Interstate may exercise substantial influence over us.  They and some of our other directors and officers have interests or positions in other entities that may compete with us.” above.17THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF ALEXANDER’S COMMON STOCK AND THE MARKET FOR THOSE SHARES GIVE RISE TO VARIOUS RISKS.The trading price of our common shares has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate.The trading price of our common shares has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control.  In addition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies.  These broad market fluctuations have in the past and may in the future adversely affect the market price of our common shares.  Among the factors that could affect the price of our common shares are:•our financial condition and performance;•the financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies or defaults;•actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;•our dividend policy;•the reputation of REITs and real estate investments generally and the attractiveness of REIT equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate companies, and fixed income securities;•uncertainty and volatility in the equity and credit markets;•fluctuations in interest rates;•changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to our securities or those of other REITs;•failure to meet analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates;•speculation in the press or investment community;•strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;•the extent of institutional investor interest in us;•the extent of short-selling of our common shares and the shares of our competitors;•fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;•general financial and economic market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for REITs and other real estate related companies;•domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance; •changes in tax laws and rules; and•all other risk factors addressed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.A significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for stockholders.Alexander’s has additional shares of its common stock available for future issuance, which could decrease the market price of the common stock currently outstanding.The interest of our current stockholders could be diluted if we issue additional equity securities.  As of December 31, 2018, we had authorized but unissued 4,826,550 shares of common stock, par value of $1.00 per share and 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share; of which 10,057 shares of common stock are reserved for issuance upon redemption of the deferred stock units previously granted to our Board of Directors.  In addition, 495,730 shares are available for future grant under the terms of our 2016 Omnibus Stock Plan.  These awards may be granted in the form of options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, deferred stock units, or other equity-based interests, and if granted, would reduce that number of shares available for future grants, provided however that an award that may be settled only in cash, would not reduce the number of shares available under the plan.  We cannot predict the impact that future issuances of common or preferred stock or any exercise of outstanding options or grants of additional equity-based interests would have on the market price of our common stock"
8,ALX,ALEXANDER'S INC,2018-02-12,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSMaterial factors that may adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition are summarized below.  The risks and uncertainties described herein may not be the only ones we face.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition. See “Forward-Looking Statements” contained herein on page 4.OUR INVESTMENTS ARE CONCENTRATED IN THE GREATER NEW YORK CITY METROPOLITAN AREA. CIRCUMSTANCES AFFECTING THIS AREA GENERALLY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.All of our properties are in the greater New York City metropolitan area and are affected by the economic cycles and risks inherent in that area.All of our revenues come from properties located in the greater New York City metropolitan area.  Real estate markets are subject to economic downturns and we cannot predict how economic conditions will impact this market in either the short or long term.  Declines in the economy or declines in the real estate market in this area could hurt our financial performance and the value of our properties.  In addition to the factors affecting the national economic condition generally, the factors affecting economic conditions in this area include: •financial performance and productivity of the media, advertising, professional services, financial, technology, retail, insurance and real estate industries;•business layoffs or downsizing;•industry slowdowns;•relocations of businesses;•changing demographics;•increased telecommuting and use of alternative work places;•changes in the number of domestic and international tourists to our markets (including, as a result of changes in the relative strengths of world currencies);•infrastructure quality; •changes in the treatment of the deductibility of state and local taxes; and•any oversupply of, or reduced demand for, real estate.It is impossible for us to assess the future effects of trends in the economic and investment climates of the greater New York City metropolitan region, and more generally of the United States, on the real estate market in this area.  Local, national or global economic downturns would negatively affect our business and profitability.We are subject to risks that affect the general and New York City retail environments.Certain of our properties are New York City retail properties.  As such, these properties are affected by the general and New York City retail environments, including the level of consumer spending and consumer confidence, change in relative strengths of world currencies, the threat of terrorism, increasing competition from discount retailers, outlet malls, retail websites and catalog companies and the impact of technological change upon the retail environment generally. These factors could adversely affect the financial condition of our retail tenants and the willingness of retailers to lease space in our retail locations. Terrorist attacks, such as those of September 11, 2001 in New York City, may adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to generate cash flow.All of our properties are located in the greater New York City metropolitan area, and our most significant property, 731 Lexington Avenue, is located on Lexington Avenue and 59th Street in Manhattan.  In response to a terrorist attack or the perceived threat of terrorism, tenants in this area may choose to relocate their businesses to less populated, lower-profile areas of the United States that may be perceived to be less likely targets of future terrorist activity and fewer customers may choose to patronize businesses in this area. This, in turn, would trigger a decrease in the demand for space in these markets, which could increase vacancies in our properties and force us to lease our properties on less favorable terms. Furthermore, we may experience increased costs for security, equipment and personnel.  As a result, the value of our properties and the level of our revenues could decline materially. 7Natural disasters and the effects of climate change could have a concentrated impact on the area which we operate and could adversely impact our results.Our investments are in the greater New York City metropolitan area and since they are concentrated along the Eastern Seaboard, natural disasters, including hurricanes, could impact our properties.  Potentially adverse consequences of “global warming” could similarly have an impact on our properties. Over time, these conditions could result in declining demand for office space in our buildings or the inability of us to operate the buildings at all. Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) property insurance on terms we find acceptable, increasing the cost of energy at our properties and requiring us to expend funds as we seek to repair and protect our properties against such risks. The incurrence of these losses, costs or business interruptions may adversely affect our operating and financial results.REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS’ VALUE AND INCOME FLUCTUATE DUE TO VARIOUS FACTORS.The value of real estate fluctuates depending on conditions in the general economy and the real estate business.  These conditions may also adversely impact our revenues and cash flows. The factors that affect the value of our real estate include, among other things: •global, national, regional and local economic conditions;•competition from other available space;•local conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area;•how well we manage our properties;•the development and/or redevelopment of our properties;•changes in market rental rates;•the timing and costs associated with property improvements and rentals;•whether we are able to pass all or portions of any increases in operating costs through to tenants;•changes in real estate taxes and other expenses;  •whether tenants and users such as customers and shoppers consider a property attractive;•changes in consumer preferences adversely affecting retailers and retail store values;•changes in space utilization by our tenants due to technology, economic conditions and business environment;•the financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies or defaults;•availability of financing on acceptable terms or at all;•inflation or deflation;•fluctuations in interest rates;•our ability to obtain adequate insurance;•changes in zoning laws and taxation;•government regulation;•consequences of any armed conflict involving, or terrorist attack against, the United States or individual acts of                      violence in public spaces, including retail centers;•potential liability under environmental or other laws or regulations;•natural disasters;•general competitive factors; and•climate changes. The rents we receive and the occupancy levels at our properties may decline as a result of adverse changes in any of these factors.  If our rental revenues and/or occupancy levels decline, we generally would expect to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and for distribution to our stockholders.  In addition, some of our major expenses, including mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs generally do not decline when the related rents decline. 8Capital markets and economic conditions can materially affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations as well as the value of an investment in our debt and equity securities.There are many factors that can affect the value of our equity securities and any debt securities we may issue in the future, including the state of the capital markets and economy.  Demand for office and retail space may decline nationwide as it did in 2008 and 2009 due to the economic downturn, bankruptcies, downsizing, layoffs and cost cutting.  Government action or inaction may adversely affect the state of the capital markets.  The cost and availability of credit may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads, which may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including our results of operations, and the liquidity and financial condition of our tenants.  Our inability or the inability of our tenants to timely refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs may materially affect our financial condition and results of operations and the value of our equity securities and any debt securities we may issue in the future. U.S. federal tax reform legislation now and in the future could affect REITs generally, the geographic markets in which we operate, the trading of our shares and our results of operations, both positively and negatively, in ways that are difficult to anticipate.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “2017 Act”) represents sweeping tax reform legislation that makes significant changes to corporate and individual tax rates and the calculation of taxes, as well as international tax rules. As a REIT, we are generally not required to pay federal taxes otherwise applicable to regular corporations if we comply with the various tax regulations governing REITs. Shareholders, however, are generally required to pay taxes on REIT dividends. The 2017 Act and future tax reform legislation could impact our share price or how shareholders and potential investors view an investment in REITs.  For example, the decrease in corporate tax rates in the 2017 Act could decrease the attractiveness of the REIT structure relative to companies that are not organized as REITs. In addition, while certain elements of the 2017 Act do not impact us directly as a REIT, they could impact the geographic markets in which we operate as well as our tenants in ways, both positive and negative, that are difficult to anticipate. For example, the limitation in the 2017 Act on the deductibility of certain state and local taxes may make operating in jurisdictions that impose such taxes at higher rates less desirable than operating in jurisdictions imposing such taxes at lower rates.  The overall impact of the 2017 Act also depends on the future interpretations and regulations that may be issued by U.S. tax authorities, and it is possible that future guidance could adversely impact us.Real estate is a competitive business.We compete with a large number of real estate property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments.  Principal factors of competition are rents charged, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and the quality of services provided.  Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the global, national and local economies, the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers,  availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation, population and employment trends, zoning laws, and our ability to lease, sublease or sell our properties, at profitable levels.  We depend on leasing space to tenants on economically favorable terms and collecting rent from tenants who may not be able to pay.Our financial results depend significantly on leasing space in our properties to tenants on economically favorable terms.  In addition, because a majority of our income is derived from renting real property, our income, funds available to pay indebtedness and funds available for distribution to stockholders will decrease if certain of our tenants cannot pay their rent or if we are not able to maintain our occupancy levels on favorable terms.  If a tenant does not pay its rent, we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and might incur substantial legal and other costs.  During periods of economic adversity for retailers or otherwise, there may be an increase in the number of tenants that cannot pay their rent and an increase in vacancy rates. We may be unable to renew leases or relet space as leases expire.When our tenants decide not to renew their leases upon their expiration, we may not be able to relet the space. Even if tenants do renew or we can relet the space, the terms of renewal or reletting, taking into account among other things, the cost of improvements to the property and leasing commissions, may be less favorable than the terms in the expired leases. In addition, changes in space utilization by our tenants may impact our ability to renew or relet space without the need to incur substantial costs in renovating or redesigning the internal configuration of the relevant property. If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the space at similar rates or if we incur substantial costs in renewing or reletting the space, our cash flow and ability to service debt obligations and pay dividends and distributions to stockholders could be adversely affected. 9Bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants may decrease our revenues, net income and available cash.From time to time, some of our tenants have declared bankruptcy, and other tenants may declare bankruptcy or become insolvent in the future.  The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant could cause us to have difficulty leasing the remainder of the affected property.  Our leases generally do not contain restrictions designed to ensure the creditworthiness of our tenants.  As a result, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant or multiple tenants could result in a lower level of net income and funds available to pay our indebtedness or make distributions to stockholders.  731 Lexington Avenue accounts for a substantial portion of our revenues.  Loss of or damage to the building would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.731 Lexington Avenue accounted for revenue of $148,324,000, $147,567,000 and $137,411,000 in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, representing approximately 64%, 65% and 66% of our total revenues in each year, respectively.  Loss of or damage to the building in excess of our insurance coverage, including as a result of a terrorist attack, would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Bloomberg represents a significant portion of our revenues.  Loss of Bloomberg as a tenant or deterioration in Bloomberg’s credit quality could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Bloomberg accounted for revenue of $105,224,000, $104,590,000 and $94,468,000 in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, representing approximately 46%, 46% and 45% of our total revenues in each year, respectively.  No other tenant accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues.  If we were to lose Bloomberg as a tenant, or if Bloomberg were to be unable to fulfill its obligations under its lease, it would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We face risks associated with our tenants being designated “Prohibited Persons” by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and similar requirements. Pursuant to Executive Order 13224 and other laws, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury (“OFAC”) maintains a list of persons designated as terrorists or who are otherwise blocked or banned (“Prohibited Persons”) from conducting business or engaging in transactions in the United States and thereby restricts our doing business with such persons. In addition, our leases, loans and other agreements may require us to comply with OFAC and related requirements, and any failure to  do so may result in a breach of such agreements.  If a tenant or other party with whom we conduct business is placed on the OFAC list or is otherwise a party with whom we are prohibited from doing business, we may be required to terminate the lease or other agreement.  Any such termination could result in a loss of revenue or otherwise negatively affect our financial results and cash flows. Our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures. Despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems, our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including computer viruses, unauthorized access, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication failures.  Any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business.  We may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions. 10The occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in our cyber security, could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information, and/or damage to our business relationships or reputation, all of which could negatively impact our financial results.We face risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons who access our systems from inside or outside our organization, and other significant disruptions of our IT networks and related systems. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Our IT networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations (including managing our building systems) and, in some cases, may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants. Although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed to not be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. A security breach or other significant disruption involving our IT networks and related systems could disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our tenants; result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or others, which others could use to compete against us or which could expose us to damage claims by third-parties for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; result in our inability to maintain the building systems relied upon by our tenants for the efficient use of their leased space; require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result; subject us to claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, penalties or termination of leases or other agreements; or damage our reputation among our tenants and investors generally. Any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We may incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and environmental contamination may impair our ability to lease and/or sell real estate.Our operations and properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment, including air and water quality, hazardous or toxic substances and health and safety.  Under some environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances released at a property.  The owner or operator may also be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage or personal injuries and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by those parties because of the contamination.  These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the release of the substances or caused the release.  The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may also impair our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.  Other laws and regulations govern indoor and outdoor air quality including those that can require the abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials in the event of damage, demolition, renovation or remodeling and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air.  The maintenance and removal of lead paint and certain electrical equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are also regulated by federal and state laws.  We are also subject to risks associated with human exposure to chemical or biological contaminants such as molds, pollens, viruses and bacteria which, above certain levels, can be alleged to be connected to allergic or other health effects and symptoms in susceptible individuals.  We could incur fines for environmental compliance and be held liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to the foregoing regulated substances or related claims arising out of environmental contamination or human exposure to contamination at or from our properties. Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment.  To date, these environmental assessments have not revealed any environmental condition material to our business.  However, identification of new compliance concerns or undiscovered areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, human exposure to contamination or changes in clean-up or compliance requirements could result in significant costs to us. In addition, we may become subject to costs or taxes, or increases therein, associated with natural resource or energy usage (such as a “carbon tax”).  These costs or taxes could increase our operating costs and decrease the cash available to pay our obligations or distribute to equity holders. 11Some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance.We maintain general liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and per property, and all-risk property and rental value insurance coverage with limits of $1.7 billion per occurrence, including coverage for acts of terrorism, with sub-limits for certain perils such as floods and earthquakes on each of our properties. Fifty Ninth Street Insurance Company, LLC (“FNSIC”), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism, including nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) acts, as defined by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act, which expires in December 2020.  Coverage for acts of terrorism (including NBCR acts) is up to $1.7 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate.  Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to FNSIC.  For NBCR acts, FNSIC is responsible for a $293,000 deductible ($306,000 effective January 1, 2018) and 17% of the balance (18% effective January 1, 2018) of a covered loss, and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining 83% (82% effective January 1, 2018) of a covered loss.  We are ultimately responsible for any loss incurred by FNSIC. We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism.  However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future.  We are responsible for deductibles and losses in excess of our insurance coverage, which could be material. Our mortgage loans are non-recourse to us and contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance.  Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future.  Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain, it could adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance our properties. Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs.The Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons.  Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants and/or legal fees to their counsel.  If, under the ADA, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the amount of cash available for distribution to stockholders.Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements.  If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards.  We do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations. Changes in the method pursuant to which the LIBOR rates are determined and potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may affect our financial results.The chief executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, has recently announced that the FCA intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Furthermore, in the United States, efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates include proposals by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. On August 24, 2017, the Federal Reserve Board requested public comment on a proposal by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in cooperation with the Office of Financial Research, to produce three new reference rates intended to serve as alternatives to LIBOR. These alternative rates are based on overnight repurchase agreement transactions secured by U.S. Treasury Securities. The Federal Reserve Bank said that the publication of these alternative rates is targeted to commence by mid-2018.Any changes announced by the FCA, including the FCA Announcement, other regulators or any other successor governance or oversight body, or future changes adopted by such body, in the method pursuant to which the LIBOR rates are determined may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in the reported LIBOR rates. If that were to occur, the level of interest payments we incur may change.  In addition, although certain of our LIBOR based obligations provide for alternative methods of calculating the interest rate payable on certain of our obligations if LIBOR is not reported, which include requesting certain rates from major reference banks in London or New York, or alternatively using LIBOR for the immediately preceding interest period or using the initial interest rate, as applicable, uncertainty as to the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher than, lower than or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the interest rates and/or payments that would have been made on our obligations if LIBOR rate was available in its current form.12We depend upon anchor tenants to attract shoppers at our Rego Park I and II retail properties.Our Rego Park I and II retail properties are anchored by well-known department stores and other tenants who generate shopping traffic.  The value of these properties would be adversely affected if our anchor tenants failed to meet their contractual obligations, sought concessions in order to continue operations or ceased their operations, including as a result of bankruptcy.  If the sales of stores operating in our properties were to decline significantly due to economic conditions, closing of anchors or for other reasons, tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges.  In the event of a default by a tenant or anchor, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord. On April 4, 2017, Sears closed its 195,000 square foot store at our Rego Park I property. Annual revenue from Sears is approximately $10,600,000, under a lease which expires in March 2021. In its 2016 annual report on Form 10-K, Sears indicated that substantial doubt exists related to its ability to continue as a going concern.WE MAY ACQUIRE OR SELL ASSETS OR DEVELOP PROPERTIES.  OUR FAILURE OR INABILITY TO CONSUMMATE THESE TRANSACTIONS OR MANAGE THE RESULTS OF THESE TRANSACTIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.We may acquire, develop, or redevelop properties and this may create risks.Although our stated business strategy is not to engage in acquisitions, we may acquire or develop properties when we believe that an acquisition or development project is otherwise consistent with our business strategy.  We may not succeed in (i) developing, redeveloping or acquiring properties; (ii) completing these activities on time or within budget; and (iii) leasing or selling developed, redeveloped or acquired properties at amounts sufficient to cover our costs.  Competition in these activities could also significantly increase our costs. Difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert management’s attention. Acquisitions or developments in new markets or types of properties where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in weaker than anticipated performance. We may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that we have begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred.  Furthermore, we may be exposed to the liabilities of properties acquired, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition. It may be difficult to buy and sell real estate quickly, which may limit our flexibility.Real estate investments are relatively difficult to buy and sell quickly.  Consequently, we may have limited ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.  Moreover, our ability to buy, sell, or finance real estate assets may be adversely affected during periods of uncertainty or unfavorable conditions in the credit markets as we, or potential buyers of our assets, may experience difficulty in obtaining financing. We have an investment in marketable equity securities.  The value of this investment may decline as a result of operating performance or economic or market conditions.We have an investment in Macerich, a retail shopping center company.  As of December 31, 2017, this investment had a carrying amount of $35,156,000.  A significant decline in the value of this investment due to, among other reasons, Macerich’s operating performance or economic or market conditions, may result in the recognition of an impairment loss, which could be material. OUR ORGANIZATIONAL AND FINANCIAL STRUCTURE GIVES RISE TO OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL RISKS.Substantially all of our assets are owned by subsidiaries.  We depend on dividends and distributions from these subsidiaries.  The creditors of these subsidiaries are entitled to amounts payable to them by the subsidiaries before the subsidiaries may pay any dividends or distributions to us.Substantially all of our properties and assets are held through our subsidiaries.  We depend on cash distributions and dividends from our subsidiaries for substantially all of our cash flow.  The creditors of each of our direct and indirect subsidiaries are entitled to payment of that subsidiary’s obligations to them when due and payable before that subsidiary may make distributions or dividends to us.  Thus, our ability to pay dividends, if any, to our security holders depends on our subsidiaries’ ability to first satisfy their obligations to their creditors and our ability to satisfy our obligations, if any, to our creditors. In addition, our participation in any distribution of the assets of any of our direct or indirect subsidiaries upon the liquidation, reorganization or insolvency of the subsidiary, is only after the claims of the creditors, including trade creditors, and preferred security holders, if any, of the applicable direct or indirect subsidiaries are satisfied. 13Our existing financing documents contain covenants and restrictions that may restrict our operational and financial flexibility.As of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding mortgage indebtedness of $1,252,440,000, secured by four of our properties.  These mortgages contain covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness on these properties, provide for lender approval of tenants’ leases in certain circumstances, and provide for yield maintenance or defeasance premiums to prepay them.  These mortgages may significantly restrict our operational and financial flexibility.  In addition, if we were to fail to perform our obligations under existing indebtedness or become insolvent or were liquidated, secured creditors would be entitled to payment in full from the proceeds of the sale of the pledged assets prior to any proceeds being paid to other creditors or to any holders of our securities.  In such an event, it is possible that we would have insufficient assets remaining to make payments to other creditors or to any holders of our securities. We have a substantial amount of indebtedness that could affect our future operations.As of December 31, 2017 total debt outstanding was $1,252,440,000. We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service. Our debt service costs generally will not be reduced if developments at the property, such as the entry of new competitors or the loss of major tenants, cause a reduction in the income from the property. Should such events occur, our operations may be adversely affected. If a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from such property is insufficient to pay that indebtedness, the property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value. We have outstanding debt, and the amount of debt and its cost may increase and refinancing may not be available on acceptable terms.As of December 31, 2017, total debt outstanding was $1,252,440,000 and our ratio of total debt to total enterprise value was 42.2%.  “Enterprise value” means the market equity value of our common stock, plus debt, less cash and cash equivalents at such date.  In addition, we have significant debt service obligations.  For the year ended December 31, 2017, our scheduled cash payments for principal and interest were $30,701,000.  In the future, we may incur additional debt, and thus increase the ratio of total debt to total enterprise value.  If our level of indebtedness increases, there may be an increased risk of default which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, in a rising interest rate environment, the cost of refinancing our existing debt and any new debt or market rate security or instrument may increase.  Continued uncertainty in the equity and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms or at all, which may negatively affect our ability to refinance our debt.    We might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT, and may be required to pay income taxes at corporate rates.Although we believe that we will remain organized and will continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we might fail to remain qualified.  Qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes is governed by highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and depends on various facts and circumstances that are not entirely within our control.  In addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the relevant tax laws and/or the federal income tax consequences of qualifying as a REIT. If, with respect to any taxable year, we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT and do not qualify under statutory relief provisions, we could not deduct distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would have to pay federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. The federal income tax payable would include any applicable alternative minimum tax. If we had to pay federal income tax, the amount of money available to distribute to stockholders and pay our indebtedness would be reduced for the year or years involved, and we would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders in that taxable year and in future years until we were able to qualify as a REIT and did so. In addition, we would also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost, unless we were entitled to relief under the relevant statutory provisions. We face possible adverse changes in tax laws, which may result in an increase in our tax liability.From time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability.  The shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in recent years may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes.  If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income.  These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for payment of dividends. Loss of our key personnel could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our common stock.We are dependent on the efforts of Steven Roth, our Chief Executive Officer.  Although we believe that we could find a replacement, the loss of his services could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our common stock.14ALEXANDER’S CHARTER DOCUMENTS AND APPLICABLE LAW MAY HINDER ANY ATTEMPT TO ACQUIRE US.Provisions in Alexander’s certificate of incorporation and by laws, as well as provisions of the Code and Delaware corporate law, may delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or a tender offer, even if such action might be beneficial to stockholders, and limit the stockholders’ opportunity to receive a potential premium for their shares of common stock over then prevailing market prices. Primarily to facilitate maintenance of its qualification as a REIT, Alexander’s certificate of incorporation generally prohibits ownership, directly, indirectly or beneficially, by any single stockholder of more than 9.9% of the outstanding shares of preferred stock of any class or 4.9% of outstanding common stock of any class.  The Board of Directors may waive or modify these ownership limits with respect to one or more persons if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of these limits will not jeopardize Alexander’s status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.  In addition, the Board of Directors has, subject to certain conditions and limitations, exempted Vornado and certain of its affiliates from these ownership limitations.  Stock owned in violation of these ownership limits will be subject to the loss of rights and other restrictions.  These ownership limits may have the effect of inhibiting or impeding a change in control. Alexander’s Board of Directors is divided into three classes of directors.  Directors of each class are chosen for three-year staggered terms.  Staggered terms of directors may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management, even though changes in management or a change in control might be in the best interest of our stockholders. In addition, Alexander’s charter documents authorize the Board of Directors to: •cause Alexander’s to issue additional authorized but unissued common stock or preferred stock;•classify or reclassify, in one or more series, any unissued preferred stock; and•set the preferences, rights and other terms of any classified or reclassified stock that Alexander’s issues. The Board of Directors could establish a series of preferred stock with terms that could delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Alexander’s or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our   stockholders, although the Board of Directors does not, at present, intend to establish a series of preferred stock of this kind.  Alexander’s charter documents contain other provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of the Company or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. In addition, Vornado, Interstate and its three general partners (each of whom are both trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexander’s) together beneficially own approximately 58.6% of our outstanding shares of common stock.  This degree of ownership is likely to reduce the possibility of a tender offer or an attempt to change control of the Company by a third party. We may change our policies without obtaining the approval of our stockholders.Our operating and financial policies, including our policies with respect to acquisitions of real estate or other assets, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and dividends, are exclusively determined by our Board of Directors.  Accordingly, our stockholders do not control these policies.15OUR OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE AND RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS MAY GIVE RISE TO CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.Steven Roth, Vornado and Interstate may exercise substantial influence over us.  They and some of our other directors and officers have interests or positions in other entities that may compete with us.As of December 31, 2017, Interstate and its partners owned approximately 7.2% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and approximately 26.2% of our outstanding common stock.  Steven Roth, David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr. are the partners of Interstate.  Mr. Roth is the Chairman of our Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado and the Managing General Partner of Interstate.  Mr. Wight and Mr. Mandelbaum are both trustees of Vornado and members of our Board of Directors.  In addition, Vornado manages and leases the real estate assets of Interstate. As of December 31, 2017, Vornado owned 32.4% of our outstanding common stock, in addition to the 26.2% owned by Interstate and its partners.  In addition to the relationships described in the immediately preceding paragraph, Dr. Richard West is a trustee of Vornado and a member of our Board of Directors and Joseph Macnow, our Treasurer, is the Executive Vice President - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer of Vornado. Matthew Iocco is our Chief Financial Officer and the Executive Vice President - Chief Accounting Officer of Vornado.   Because of their overlapping interests, Vornado, Mr. Roth, Interstate and the other individuals noted in the preceding paragraphs may have substantial influence over Alexander’s, and on the outcome of any matters submitted to Alexander’s stockholders for approval.  In addition, certain decisions concerning our operations or financial structure may present conflicts of interest among Vornado, Messrs. Roth, Mandelbaum and Wight and Interstate and other security holders.  Vornado, Mr. Roth and Interstate may, in the future, engage in a wide variety of activities in the real estate business which may result in conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting us, such as, which of these entities or persons, if any, may take advantage of potential business opportunities, the business focus of these entities, the types of properties and geographic locations in which these entities make investments, potential competition between business activities conducted, or sought to be conducted, by us, competition for properties and tenants, possible corporate transactions such as acquisitions, and other strategic decisions affecting the future of these entities. There may be conflicts of interest between Vornado, its affiliates and us.Vornado manages, develops and leases our properties under agreements that have one-year terms expiring in March of each year, which are automatically renewable.  Because we share common senior management with Vornado and because four of the trustees of Vornado are on our Board of Directors, the terms of the foregoing agreements and any future agreements may not be comparable to those we could have negotiated with an unaffiliated third party. For a description of Interstate’s ownership of Vornado and Alexander’s, see “Steven Roth, Vornado and Interstate may exercise substantial influence over us.  They and some of our other directors and officers have interests or positions in other entities that may compete with us.” above.16THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF ALEXANDER’S COMMON STOCK AND THE MARKET FOR THOSE SHARES GIVE RISE TO VARIOUS RISKS.The trading price of our common shares has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate.The trading price of our common shares has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control.  In addition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies.  These broad market fluctuations have in the past and may in the future adversely affect the market price of our common shares.  Among the factors that could affect the price of our common shares are:•our financial condition and performance;•the financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies or defaults;•actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;•our dividend policy;•the reputation of REITs and real estate investments generally and the attractiveness of REIT equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate companies, and fixed income securities;•uncertainty and volatility in the equity and credit markets;•fluctuations in interest rates;•changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to our securities or those of other REITs;•failure to meet analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates;•speculation in the press or investment community;•strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;•the extent of institutional investor interest in us;•the extent of short-selling of our common shares and the shares of our competitors;•fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;•general financial and economic market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for REITs and other real estate related companies;•domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance; •changes in tax laws and rules; and•all other risk factors addressed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.A significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for stockholders.Alexander’s has additional shares of its common stock available for future issuance, which could decrease the market price of the common stock currently outstanding.The interest of our current stockholders could be diluted if we issue additional equity securities.  As of December 31, 2017, we had authorized but unissued 4,826,550 shares of common stock, par value of $1.00 per share and 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share; of which 8,692 shares of common stock are reserved for issuance upon redemption of the deferred stock units previously granted to our Board of Directors.  In addition, 497,095 shares are available for future grant under the terms of our 2016 Omnibus Stock Plan.  These awards may be granted in the form of options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, deferred stock units, or other equity-based interests, and if granted, would reduce that number of shares available for future grants, provided however that an award that may be settled only in cash, would not reduce the number of shares available under the plan.  We cannot predict the impact that future issuances of common or preferred stock or any exercise of outstanding options or grants of additional equity-based interests would have on the market price of our common stock"
3,ALX,ALEXANDER'S INC,2008-02-25,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS  Material factors that may adversely affect our business and operations are summarized below.  REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS VALUE AND INCOME FLUCTUATE DUE TO VARIOUS FACTORS.The value of real estate fluctuates depending on conditions in the general economy and the real estate business.  These conditions may also limit our revenues and available cash. The factors that affect the value of our real estate include, among other things:    national, regional and local economic conditions;     consequences of any armed conflict involving, or terrorist attack against, the United States;     our ability to secure adequate insurance;     local conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area;     competition from other available space;     whether tenants and users such as customers and shoppers consider a property attractive;     the financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies or defaults;      whether we are able to pass some or all of any increased operating costs through to tenants;      how well we manage our properties;      fluctuations in interest rates;      changes in real estate taxes and other expenses;      changes in market rental rates;      the timing and costs associated with property improvements and rentals;       changes in taxation or zoning laws;      government regulation;      availability of financing on acceptable terms or at all;      potential liability under environmental or other laws or regulations; and      general competitive factors.    The rents we receive and the occupancy levels at our properties may decline as a result of adverse changes in any of these factors.  If our rental revenues and/or occupancy levels decline, we generally would expect to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and distribute to our stockholders.  In addition, some of our major expenses, including mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs, generally do not decline when the related rents decline. We depend on leasing space to tenants on economically favorable terms and collecting rent from our tenants, who may not be able to pay.Our financial results depend significantly on leasing space in our properties to tenants on economically favorable terms.  In addition, because a majority of our income is derived from renting real property, our income, funds available to pay indebtedness and funds available for distribution to our stockholders will decrease if a significant number of our tenants cannot pay their rent or if we are not able to maintain our level of occupancy on favorable terms.  If a tenant does not pay its rent, we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and might incur substantial legal and other costs. Bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants may decrease our revenues, net income and available cash.From time to time, some of our tenants have declared bankruptcy, and other tenants may declare bankruptcy or become insolvent in the future.  If a major tenant declares bankruptcy or becomes insolvent, the rental property at which it leases space may have lower revenues and operational difficulties.  In the case of our shopping centers, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant could cause us to have difficulty leasing the remainder of the affected property.  Our leases generally do not contain restrictions designed to ensure the creditworthiness of our tenants.  As a result, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant could result in a lower level of net income and funds available for the payment of our indebtedness or distribution to our stockholders.  7 Some of our tenants represent a significant portion of our revenues.  Loss of these tenant relationships or deterioration in the tenants credit quality could adversely affect results.Bloomberg L.P. accounted for 32%, 34% and 34% of our consolidated revenues in the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  If we fail to maintain a relationship with any of our significant tenants or fail to perform our obligations under agreements with these tenants, or if any of these tenants fail or become unable to perform their obligations under the agreements, we expect that any one or more of these events would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Although inflation has not materially impacted our operations in the recent past, increased inflation could have a pronounced negative impact on our mortgage and debt interest and general and administrative expenses as these costs could increase at rates higher than our rents.  Inflation could also have an adverse effect on consumer spending which could impact our tenants sales and, in turn, our overage rents, where applicable. Real estate is a competitive business.We operate in a highly competitive environment.  All of our properties are located in the greater New York City metropolitan area.  We compete with a large number of real estate property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments.  Principal factors of competition are rents charged, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and breadth and quality of services provided.  Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of national and local economies, the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends.   We may incur costs to comply with environmental laws.Our operations and properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment including air and water quality, hazardous or toxic substances and health and safety.  Under some environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances released at a property.  The owner or operator may also be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage or personal injuries and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by those parties because of the contamination.  These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the release of the substances or caused such release.  The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may impair our ability to sell or leasereal estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.  Other laws and regulations govern indoor and outdoor air quality including those that can require the abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials in the event of damage, demolition, renovation or remodeling and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air.  The maintenance and removal of lead paint and certain electrical equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and underground storage tanks are also regulated by federal and state laws.  We are also subject to risks associated with human exposure to chemical or biological contaminants such as molds, pollens, viruses and bacteria which, above certain levels, can be alleged to be connected to allergic or other health effects and symptoms in susceptible individuals.  We could incur fines for environmental compliance and be held liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to the foregoing regulated substances or tanks orrelated claims arising out of environmental contamination or human exposure at or from our properties. Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times.  Except as referenced below, the environmental assessments did not, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, reveal any environmental condition material to our business.  However, identification of new compliance concerns or undiscovered areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, discovery of additional sites, human exposure to the contamination or changes in cleanup or compliance requirements could result in significant costs to us. In July 2006, we discovered an oil spill at our Kings Plaza Regional Shopping Center.  We have notified the NYSDEC about the spill and have developed a remediation plan. The NYSDEC has approved a portion of the remediation plan and clean up is ongoing.  The estimated costs associated with the clean up will aggregate approximately $2,500,000 and a claim has been made under our insurance policy, subject to our $500,000 deductible which was accrued in 2006.  Of this amount, $426,000 has been paid as of December 31, 2007.        8 Some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance.We carry commercial liability and all risk property insurance for (i) fire, (ii) flood, (iii) rental loss, (iv) extended coverage, and (v) acts of terrorism, as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (TRIPRA) of 2007, which expires in 2014, with respect to our assets, with limits of (i) $965,000,000 per occurrence, including terrorist acts, as defined, for our 731 Lexington Avenue property, and (ii) $500,000,000 per occurrence, including terrorist acts, as defined, for our other properties.  To the extent that we incur losses in excess of our insurance coverage, these losses would be borne by us and could be material. Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties (which are generally non-recourse to us), contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance.  Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for the purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future.  Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain, it could adversely affect our ability to finance and/or refinance our properties. Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs.The Americans with Disabilities Act generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, be made accessible to disabled persons.  Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants.  If, under the Americans with Disabilities Act, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders. Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements.  If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards.  We do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations. OUR INVESTMENTS ARE CONCENTRATED IN THE GREATER NEW YORK CITY METROPOLITAN AREA.  CIRCUMSTANCES AFFECTING THIS AREA GENERALLY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.All of our properties are in the greater New York City metropolitan area and are affected by the economic cycles and risks inherent in that area.During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, all of our revenues came from properties located in the greater New York City metropolitan area.  Like other real estate markets, the real estate market in this area has experienced economic downturns in the past, and we cannot predict how economic conditions will impact this market in either the short or long term.  Declines in the economy or a decline in the real estate market in this area could hurt the value of our properties and our financial performance.  The factors affecting economic conditions in this region include:     business layoffs or downsizing;     industry slowdowns;     relocations of businesses;     changing demographics;     increased telecommuting and use of alternative work places;     financial performance and productivity of the publishing, advertising, financial, technology, retail, insurance and real estate industries;     infrastructure quality; and     any oversupply of, or reduced demand for, real estate.   It is impossible for us to assess the future effects of the current uncertain trends in the economic and investment climates of the greater New York City metropolitan region, and more generally of the United States, on the real estate market in this area.  If these conditions persist, or if there is any local, national or global economic downturn, our businesses and future profitability may be adversely affected. 9 We are subject to risks that affect the general retail environment.A substantial proportion of our properties are in the retail shopping center real estate market.  This means that we are subject to factors that affect the retail environment generally, including the level of consumer spending and consumer confidence, the threat of terrorism and increasing competition from discount retailers, outlet malls, retail websites and catalog companies.  These factors could adversely affect the financial condition of our retail tenants and the willingness of retailers to lease space in our shopping centers.   Terrorist attacks, such as those of September 11, 2001 in New York City, may adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to generate cash flow.All of our properties are located in the greater New York City metropolitan area.  In the aftermath of a terrorist attack, tenants in this area may choose to relocate their businesses to less populated, lower-profile areas of the United States that are not as likely to be targets of future terrorist activity and fewer customers may choose to patronize businesses in this area.  This would trigger a decrease in the demand for space in these markets, which could increase vacancies in our properties and force us to lease our properties on less favorable terms.  As a result, the value of our properties and the level of our revenues could decline materially. WE      MAY ACQUIRE OR SELL ADDITIONAL ASSETS OR DEVELOP ADDITIONAL      PROPERTIES. OUR FAILURE OR INABILITY TO CONSUMMATE THESE      TRANSACTIONS OR MANAGE THE RESULTS OF THESE TRANSACTIONS      COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.We may acquire or develop properties and this may create risks.Although our stated business strategy is not to engage in acquisitions, we may acquire or develop properties when we believe that an acquisition or development project is otherwise consistent with our business strategy.  We may not, however, succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget.  In addition, we may face competition in pursuing acquisition or development opportunities that could increase our costs.  When we do pursue a project or acquisition, we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover their costs of acquisition or development and operations.  Difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert managements attention.  Acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledgemay result in poorer than anticipated performance.  We may abandon acquisition or development opportunities that we have begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and have devoted management time to a matter not consummated.   It may be difficult to buy and sell real estate quickly.Real    estate investments are relatively difficult to buy and sell    quickly. Consequently, we may have limited ability to vary    our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic    or other conditions. Moreover, our ability to buy, sell,    or finance real estate assets may be adversely affected during    periods of uncertainty or unfavorable conditions in the credit    markets as we, or potential buyers of our assets, may experience    difficulty in obtaining financing.  OUR ORGANIZATIONAL AND FINANCIAL STRUCTURE GIVES RISE TO OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL RISKS.We depend on dividends and distributions from our direct and indirect subsidiaries.  The creditors of these subsidiaries are entitled to amounts payable to them by the subsidiaries before the subsidiaries may pay any dividends or distributions to us.Substantially all of our properties and assets are held through subsidiaries.  We depend on cash distributions and dividends from our subsidiaries for substantially all of our cash flow.  The creditors of each of our direct and indirect subsidiaries are entitled to payment of that subsidiarys obligations to them when due, and payable before that subsidiary may make distributions or dividends to us.  Thus, our ability to pay dividends, if any, to our security holders depends on our subsidiaries ability to first satisfy their obligations to their creditors and our ability to satisfy our obligations, if any, to our creditors. In addition, our participation in any distribution of the assets of any of our direct or indirect subsidiaries upon the liquidation, reorganization or insolvency of the subsidiary, is only after the claims of the creditors, including trade creditors, and preferred security holders, if any, of the applicable direct or indirect subsidiaries are satisfied. 10 Our existing financing documents contain covenants and restrictions that may restrict our operational and financial flexibility.At December 31, 2007, substantially all of the individual properties we own were encumbered by mortgages.  These mortgages contain covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness on these properties, provide for lender approval of tenants leases in certain circumstances, and provide for yield maintenance or defeasance premiums to prepay them.  These mortgages may significantly restrict our operational and financial flexibility.  In addition, if we were to fail to perform our obligations under existing indebtedness or become insolvent or were liquidated, secured creditors would be entitled to payment in full from the proceeds of the sale of the pledged assets prior to any proceeds being paid to other creditors or to any holders of our securities.  In such an event, it is possible that we would have insufficient assets remaining to make payments to other creditors or toany holders of our securities.   We have indebtedness, and this indebtedness and the cost to service it, may increase.As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately $1,110,197,000 in total debt outstanding.  Our ratio of total debt to total enterprise value was 47.6% at December 31, 2007.  Enterprise value means the market equity value of our common stock, plus debt, less cash and cash equivalents at such date.  In addition, we have significant debt service obligations.  For the year ended December 31, 2007, our scheduled cash payments for principal and interest were $78,927,000.  In the future, we may incur additional debt, and thus increase the ratio of total debt to total enterprise value.  If our level of indebtedness increases, there may be an increased risk of default that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, in a rising interest rate environment, the cost of refinancing our existing debt and any new debt or market rate security orinstrument may increase.   We have issued outstanding and exercisable stock appreciation rights.  The exercise of these stock appreciation rights may impact our liquidity.As of December 31, 2007, we had 500,000 stock appreciation rights (SARs) that were outstanding and exercisable.  These SARs have a weighted-average exercise price of $70.38 and are scheduled to expire on March 4, 2009.  Since the SARs agreements require that they be settled in cash, we would have had to pay $141,437,000 to the holders of these SARs had they exercised their SARs on December 31, 2007.  Any change in our stock price from the closing price of $353.25 at December 31, 2007 would increase or decrease the amount we would have to pay upon exercise. We might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT, and may be required to pay income taxes at corporate rates.Although we believe that we will remain organized and will continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we might fail to remain qualified.  Qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes is governed by highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code) for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations.  Qualification as a REIT also depends on various facts and circumstances that are not entirely within our control.  In addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions might significantly change the tax laws with respect to the requirements for qualification as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of qualification as a REIT. In order to qualify and maintain our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we are required, among other conditions, to distribute as dividends to our stockholders, at least 90% of annual REIT taxable income.  As of December 31, 2007, we had reported net operating loss carryovers (NOLs) of $1,597,000, which generally would be available to offset the amount of REIT taxable income that we otherwise would be required to distribute.  However, the NOLs reported on the tax returns are not binding on the Internal Revenue Service and are subject to adjustment as a result of future audits.  In addition, under Section 382 of the Code, the ability to use our NOLs could be limited if, generally, there are significant changes in the ownership of our outstanding stock.  Since our reorganization as a REIT commencing in 1995, we have not paid regular dividends and do notbelieve that we will be required to, and may not, pay regular dividends until the NOLs have been fully utilized.  11 We face possible adverse changes in tax laws.From time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability.  The shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in recent years may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes.  If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income.  These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for payment of dividends. Loss of our key personnel could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our common stock.We are dependent on the efforts of Steven Roth, our Chief Executive Officer, and Michael D. Fascitelli, our President. While we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our common stock. ALEXANDERS CHARTER DOCUMENTS AND APPLICABLE LAW MAY HINDER ANY ATTEMPT TO ACQUIRE US.Provisions in Alexanders certificate of incorporation and by laws, as well as provisions of the Code and Delaware corporate law, may delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or a tender offer, even if such action might be beneficial to stockholders, and limit the stockholders opportunity to receive a potential premium for their shares of common stock over then prevailing market prices. Primarily to facilitate maintenance of its qualification as a REIT, Alexanders certificate of incorporation generally prohibits ownership, directly, indirectly or beneficially, by any single stockholder of more than 9.9% of the outstanding shares of preferred stock of any class or 4.9% of outstanding common stock of any class.  The Board of Directors may waive or modify these ownership limits with respect to one or more persons if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of these limits will not jeopardize Alexanders status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.  In addition, the Board of Directors has, subject to certain conditions and limitations, exempted Vornado and certain of its affiliates from these ownership limitations.  Stocks owned in violation of these ownership limits will be subject to the loss of rights and other restrictions.  These ownership limits may havethe effect of inhibiting or impeding a change in control. Alexanders Board of Directors is divided into three classes of directors.  Directors of each class are chosen for three-year staggered terms.  Staggered terms of directors may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management, even though changes in management or a change in control might be in the best interest of our stockholders. In addition, Alexanders charter documents authorize the Board of Directors to:    cause Alexanders to issue additional authorized but unissued common stock or preferred stock;     classify or reclassify, in one or more series, any unissued preferred stock;     set the preferences, rights and other terms of any classified or reclassified stock that Alexanders issues; and     increase, without stockholder approval, the number of shares of beneficial interest that Alexanders may issue.   The Board of Directors could establish a series of preferred stock with terms that could delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Alexanders or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders, although the Board of Directors does not, at present, intend to establish a series of preferred stock of this kind.  Alexanders charter documents contain other provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of the Company or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. In addition, Vornado and Interstate (the three general partners of which are both trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexanders) together beneficially own approximately 60.0% of our outstanding shares of common stock.  This degree of ownership may also reduce the possibility of a tender offer or an attempt to change control of the Company. 12 We may change our policies without obtaining the approval of our stockholders.Our operating and financial policies, including our policies with respect to acquisitions of real estate or other assets, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and dividends, are exclusively determined by our Board of Directors.  Accordingly, our stockholders do not control these policies. OUR OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE AND RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS MAY GIVE RISE TO CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.Steven Roth, Vornado and Interstate may exercise substantial influence over us.  They and some of our other directors and officers have interests or positions in other entities that may compete with us.At December 31, 2007, Interstate and its partners owned approximately 8.3% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and approximately 27.2% of our outstanding common stock.  Steven Roth, David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr. are the partners of Interstate.  Mr. Roth is the Chairman of our Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado and the Managing General Partner of Interstate.  Mr. Wight and Mr. Mandelbaum are both trustees of Vornado and members of our Board of Directors.  In addition, Vornado manages and leases the real estate assets of Interstate. At December 31, 2007, Vornado owned 32.8% of our outstanding common stock, in addition to the 27.2% owned by Interstate and its partners.  In addition to the relationships described in the immediately preceding paragraph, Michael D. Fascitelli, the President and a trustee of Vornado, is our President and a member of our Board of Directors. Richard West is a trustee of Vornado and a member of our Board of Directors.  In addition, Joseph Macnow, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, holds the same positions with Vornado. Because of their overlapping interests, Vornado, Mr. Roth, Interstate and the other individuals noted in the preceding paragraphs may have substantial influence over Alexanders, and on the outcome of any matters submitted to Alexanders stockholders for approval.  In addition, certain decisions concerning our operations or financial structure may present conflicts of interest among Vornado, Messrs. Roth, Mandelbaum and Wight and Interstate and other security holders.  Vornado, Mr. Roth and Interstate may, in the future, engage in a wide variety of activities in the real estate business which may result in conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting us, such as, which of these entities or persons, if any, may take advantage of potential business opportunities, the business focus of these entities, the types of properties and geographic locations in whichthese entities make investments, potential competition between business activities conducted, or sought to be conducted, by us, competition for properties and tenants, possible corporate transactions such as acquisitions, and other strategic decisions affecting the future of these entities. There may be conflicts of interest between Vornado, its affiliates and us.Vornado manages, develops and leases our properties under agreements that have one-year terms expiring in March of each year, which are automatically renewable.  Because we share common senior management with Vornado and because five of the trustees of Vornado also constitute the majority of our directors, the terms of the foregoing agreements and any future agreements may not be comparable to those we could have negotiated with an unaffiliated third party. For a description of Interstates ownership of Vornado and Alexanders, see Steven Roth, Vornado and Interstate may exercise substantial influence over us.  They and some of our other directors and officers have interests or positions in other entities that may compete with us. above. 13 THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF ALEXANDERS COMMON STOCK AND THE MARKET FOR THOSE SHARES GIVE RISE TO VARIOUS RISKS.Alexanders has available for issuance, shares of its common stock and outstanding and exercisable options to purchase its common stock.  The issuance of this stock or the exercise of these options could decrease the market price of the shares of common stock currently outstanding.As of December 31, 2007, we had authorized but unissued 4,826,550 shares of common stock, par value of $1.00 per share and 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share.  In addition, as of December 31, 2007, 61,900 options were outstanding and exercisable at a weighted-average exercise price of $70.38 and as of December 31, 2007, 500,000 SARs were outstanding and exercisable at a weighted-average exercise price of $70.38.  Additionally, 895,000 shares are available for future grant under the terms of our 2006 Omnibus Stock Plan. These awards may be granted in the form of options, restricted stock, SARs or other equity-based interests, and if granted, would reduce that number of shares available for future grant, provided however that an award that may be settled only in cash, would not reduce the number of shares available under the plan.  We cannot predict the impact thatfuture issuances of common or preferred stock or any exercise of outstanding options or grants of additional equity-based interests would have on the market price of our common stock. Changes in market conditions could decrease the market price of our securities.The value of our securities depends on various market conditions, which may change from time to time.  Among the market conditions that may affect the value of our securities are the following:   the            extent of institutional investor interest in us; the            reputation of REITs generally and the attractiveness            of their equity securities in comparison to other            equity securities, including securities issued by            other real estate companies, and fixed income securities; our            financial condition and performance; and general            financial market and economic conditions. The stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies.  "
7,ALX,ALEXANDER'S INC,2007-02-26,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS  Set forth below are material factors that may adversely affect our business and operations.  REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS VALUE AND INCOME FLUCTUATE DUE TO VARIOUS FACTORS.The value of real estate fluctuates depending on conditions in the general economy and the real estate business.  These conditions may also limit our revenues and available cash. The factors that affect the value of our real estate include, among other things:    national, regional and local economic conditions;     consequences of any armed conflict involving, or terrorist attack against, the United States;     our ability to secure adequate insurance;     local conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area;     competition from other available space;     whether tenants and users such as customers and shoppers consider a property attractive;     the financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies or defaults;      whether we are able to pass some or all of any increased operating costs through to tenants;      how well we manage our properties;      fluctuations in interest rates;      changes in real estate taxes and other expenses;      changes in market rental rates;      the timing and costs associated with property improvements and rentals;       changes in taxation or zoning laws;      government regulation;      availability of financing on acceptable terms or at all;      potential liability under environmental or other laws or regulations; and      general competitive factors.    The rents we receive and the occupancy levels at our properties may decline as a result of adverse changes in any of these factors.  If our rental revenues decline, we generally would expect to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and distribute to our stockholders.  In addition, some of our major expenses, including mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs, generally do not decline when the related rents decline. We depend on leasing space to tenants on economically favorable terms and collecting rent from our tenants, who may not be able to pay.Our financial results depend significantly on leasing space in our properties to tenants on economically favorable terms.  In addition, because a majority of our income comes from renting real property, our income, funds available to pay indebtedness and funds available for distribution to our stockholders will decrease if a significant number of our tenants cannot pay their rent or if we are not able to maintain our level of occupancy on favorable terms.  If a tenant does not pay its rent, we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and might incur substantial legal and other costs. Bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants may decrease our revenues, net income and available cash.From time to time, some of our tenants have declared bankruptcy, and other tenants may declare bankruptcy or become insolvent in the future.  If a major tenant declares bankruptcy or becomes insolvent, the rental property at which it leases space may have lower revenues and operational difficulties.  In the case of our shopping centers, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant could cause us to have difficulty leasing the remainder of the affected property.  Our leases generally do not contain restrictions designed to ensure the creditworthiness of our tenants.  As a result, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant could result in a lower level of net income and funds available for the payment of our indebtedness or distribution to our stockholders.  7 Some of our tenants represent a significant portion of our revenues.  Loss of these tenant relationships or deterioration in the tenants credit quality could adversely affect results.Bloomberg L.P. accounted for 34%, 34% and 36% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  Sears accounted for 11% of our consolidated revenues in 2004.  If we fail to maintain a relationship with any of our significant tenants or fail to perform our obligations under agreements with these tenants, or if any of these tenants fail or become unable to perform their obligations under the agreements, we expect that any one or more of these events would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Although inflation has not materially impacted our operations in the recent past, increased inflation could have a pronounced negative impact on our mortgage and debt interest and general and administrative expenses, as theses costs could increase at a rate higher than our rents.  Inflation could also have an adverse effect on consumer spending which could impact our tenants sales and, in turn, our overage rents, where applicable. Real estate is a competitive business.We operate in a highly competitive environment.  All of our properties are located in the greater New York City metropolitan area.  We compete with a large number of real estate property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments.  Principal factors of competition are rents charged, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and breadth and quality of services provided.  Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of national and local economies, the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends.   We may incur costs to comply with environmental laws.Our operations and properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment including air and water quality, hazardous or toxic substances and health and safety.  Under some environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances released at a property.  The owner or operator may also be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage or personal injuries and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by those parties because of the contamination.  These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the release of the substances or caused the release.  The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may impair our ability to sell or leasereal estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.  Other laws and regulations govern indoor and outdoor air quality including those that can require the abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials in the event of damage, demolition, renovation or remodeling and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air.  The maintenance and removal of lead paint and certain electrical equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and underground storage tanks are also regulated by federal and state laws.  We are also subject to risks associated with human exposure to chemical or biological contaminants such as molds, pollens, viruses and bacteria which, above certain levels, can be alleged to be connected to allergic or other health effects and symptoms in susceptible individuals.  We could incur fines for environmental compliance and be held liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to the foregoing regulated substances or tanks orrelated claims arising out of environmental contamination or human exposure at or from our properties. Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times.  Except as referenced below, the environmental assessments did not, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, reveal any environmental condition material to our business.  However, identification of new compliance concerns or undiscovered areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, discovery of additional sites, human exposure to the contamination or changes in cleanup or compliance requirements could result in significant costs to us. In June 1997, the Kings Plaza Regional Shopping Center commissioned an Environmental Study and Contamination Assessment Site Investigation (the Phase II Study) to evaluate and delineate environmental conditions disclosed in a Phase I study.  The results of the Phase II Study indicated the presence of petroleum and bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate contamination in the soil and groundwater.  We delineated the contamination, developed a remediation approach, and in July 2000 entered into a voluntary cleanup agreement with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC).  We have completed the remediation work required pursuant to the NYSDEC remedial action workplan and have paid $2,675,000, which was accrued in previous years, for our estimated obligation with respect to the cleanup of the site. 8 In July 2006, we discovered an oil spill at the above site.   Based on a preliminary investigation, the spill may have occurred as a result of the actions of independent contractors retained by us.  We have notified the NYSDEC about the spill and will be developing a remediation approach to clean up the site.  The estimated costs associated with the clean up of the site will aggregate approximately $2,500,000, which we expect to be covered under our insurance policy, subject to our $500,000 deductible, which we have accrued.  We intend to pursue all available remedies against parties believed to be at fault to the extent it is cost effective.   Some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance.We carry comprehensive liability and all risk property insurance for (i) fire, (ii) flood, (iii) extended coverage, (iv) acts of terrorism as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005, which expires in 2007, and (v) rental loss insurance with respect to our assets, with limits of (i) $965,000,000 per occurrence, including certified terrorist acts and $350,000,000 for non-certified terrorist acts for our 731 Lexington Avenue property, and (ii) $500,000,000 per occurrence, including certified terrorist acts and $350,000,000 for non-certified terrorist acts for our other properties.  To the extent that we incur losses in excess of our insurance coverage, these losses would be borne by us and could be material. Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties (which are generally non-recourse to us), contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance.  Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage under these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future.  Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain, or if the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005 is not extended past 2007, it could adversely affect our ability to finance and/or refinance our properties. Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs.The Americans with Disabilities Act generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, be made accessible to disabled persons.  Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants.  If, under the Americans with Disabilities Act, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders. Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements.  If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards.  We do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations. OUR INVESTMENTS ARE CONCENTRATED IN THE GREATER NEW YORK CITY METROPOLITAN AREA.  CIRCUMSTANCES AFFECTING THIS AREA GENERALLY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.All of our properties are in the greater New York City metropolitan area and are affected by the economic cycles and risks inherent in that area.During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, all of our revenues came from properties located in the greater New York City metropolitan area.  Like other real estate markets, the real estate market in this area has experienced economic downturns in the past, and we cannot predict how economic conditions will impact this market in either the short or long term.  Declines in the economy or a decline in the real estate market in this area could hurt the value of our properties and our financial performance.  The factors affecting economic conditions in this region include:     business layoffs or downsizing;     industry slowdowns;     relocations of businesses;     changing demographics;     increased telecommuting and use of alternative work places;     financial performance and productivity of the publishing, advertising, financial, technology, retail, insurance and real estate industries;     infrastructure quality; and     any oversupply of, or reduced demand for, real estate.   It is impossible for us to assess the future effects of the current uncertain trends in the economic and investment climates of the greater New York City metropolitan region, and more generally of the United States, on the real estate market in this area.  If these conditions persist, or if there is any local, national or global economic downturn, our businesses and future profitability may be adversely affected. 9 We are subject to risks that affect the general retail environment.A substantial proportion of our properties are in the retail shopping center real estate market.  This means that we are subject to factors that affect the retail environment generally, including the level of consumer spending and consumer confidence, the threat of terrorism and increasing competition from discount retailers, outlet malls, retail websites and catalog companies.  These factors could adversely affect the financial condition of our retail tenants and the willingness of retailers to lease space in our shopping centers.   Terrorist attacks, such as those of September 11, 2001 in New York City, may adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to generate cash flow.All of our properties are located in the greater New York City metropolitan area.  In the aftermath of any terrorist attacks, tenants in this area may choose to relocate their businesses to less populated, lower-profile areas of the United States that are not as likely to be targets of future terrorist activity and fewer customers may choose to patronize businesses in this area.  This would trigger a decrease in the demand for space in these markets, which could increase vacancies in our properties and force us to lease our properties on less favorable terms.  As a result, the value of our properties and the level of our revenues could decline materially. WE MAY AQUIRE OR SELL ADDITIONAL ASSETS OR DEVELOP ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES.  OUR FAILURE OR INABILITY TO CONSUMMATE THESE TRANSACTIONS OR MANAGE THE RESULTS OF THESE TRANSACTIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.We may acquire or develop properties and this may create risks.Although our stated business strategy is not to engage in acquisitions, we may acquire or develop properties when we believe that an acquisition or development project is consistent with our business strategy.  We may not, however, succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget.  In addition, we may face competition in pursuing acquisition or development opportunities that could increase our costs.  When we do pursue a project or acquisition, we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover their costs of acquisition or development and operations.  Difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert managements attention.  Acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may resultin poorer than anticipated performance.  We may abandon acquisition or development opportunities that we have begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and have devoted management time to a matter not consummated.   It may be difficult to buy and sell real estate quickly.Real estate investments are relatively difficult to buy and sell quickly.  Consequently, we may have limited ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.   OUR ORGANIZATIONAL AND FINANCIAL STRUCTURE GIVES RISE TO OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL RISKS.We depend on dividends and distributions from our direct and indirect subsidiaries.  The creditors of these subsidiaries are entitled to amounts payable to them by the subsidiaries before the subsidiaries may pay any dividends or distributions to us.Substantially all of our properties and assets are held through subsidiaries.  We depend on cash distributions and dividends from our subsidiaries for substantially all of our cash flow.  The creditors of each of our direct and indirect subsidiaries are entitled to payment of that subsidiarys obligations to them, when due and payable, before that subsidiary may make distributions or dividends to us.  Thus, our ability to pay dividends, if any, to our security holders depends on our subsidiaries ability to first satisfy their obligations to their creditors and our ability to satisfy our obligations, if any, to our creditors. In addition, our participation in any distribution of the assets of any of our direct or indirect subsidiaries upon the liquidation, reorganization or insolvency of the subsidiary, is only after the claims of the creditors, including trade creditors, and preferred security holders, if any, of the applicable direct or indirect subsidiaries are satisfied. 10 Our existing financing documents contain covenants and restrictions that may restrict our operational and financial flexibility.At December 31, 2006, individual properties we own are encumbered by mortgages.  These mortgages contain covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness on these properties, provide for lender approval of tenants leases in certain circumstances, and provide for yield maintenance to prepay them.  These mortgages may significantly restrict our operational and financial flexibility.  In addition, if we were to fail to perform our obligations under existing indebtedness or become insolvent or were liquidated, secured creditors would be entitled to payment in full from the proceeds of the sale of the pledged assets prior to any proceeds being paid to other creditors or to any holders of our securities.  In such an event, it is possible that we would have insufficient assets remaining to make payments to other creditors or to any holders of our securities.  We have indebtedness, and this indebtedness and the cost to service it, may increase.As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately $1,068,498,000 in total debt outstanding.  Our ratio of total debt to total enterprise value was 41.6% at December 31, 2006.  Enterprise value means the market equity value of our common stock, plus debt, less cash and cash equivalents at such date.  In addition, we have significant debt service obligations.  For the year ended December 31, 2006, our scheduled cash payments for principal and interest were $77,492,000.  In the future, we may incur additional debt, and thus increase the ratio of total debt to total enterprise value.  If our level of indebtedness increases, there may be an increased risk of default that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, in a rising interest rate environment, the cost of refinancing our existing debt and any new debt or market rate security orinstrument may increase.   We have issued outstanding and exercisable stock appreciation rights.  The exercise of these stock appreciation rights may impact our liquidity.As    of December 31, 2006, 850,000 stock appreciation rights (SARs)    were outstanding and exercisable, of which 350,000 expire    on March 14, 2007 and 500,000 expire on March 4, 2009. These    SARs have a weighted-average exercise price of $141.80. Since    the SARs agreements require that they be settled in cash,    we would have had to pay $236,176,000 if the holders of these    SARs had exercised their SARs on December 31, 2006. Any change    in our stock price from the closing price of $419.65 at December    31, 2006 would increase or decrease the amount we would have    to pay upon exercise. We might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT, and may be required to pay income taxes at corporate rates.Although we believe that we will remain organized and will continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we might fail to remain qualified.  Qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes are governed by highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code) for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations.  Qualification as a REIT also depends on various facts and circumstances that are not entirely within our control.  In addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions might significantly change the tax laws with respect to the requirements for qualification as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of qualification as a REIT. In order to qualify and maintain our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we are required, among other conditions, to distribute as dividends to our stockholders, at least 90% of annual REIT taxable income.  As of December 31, 2006, we had reported net operating loss carryovers (NOLs) of $2,001,000, which generally would be available to offset the amount of REIT taxable income that we otherwise would be required to distribute.  However, the NOLs reported on the tax returns are not binding on the Internal Revenue Service and are subject to adjustment as a result of future audits.  In addition, under Section 382 of the Code, the ability to use our NOLs could be limited if, generally, there are significant changes in the ownership of our outstanding stock.  Since our reorganization as a REIT commencing in 1995, we have not paid regular dividends and do notbelieve that we will be required to, and may not, pay regular dividends until the NOLs have been fully utilized.  11 We face possible adverse changes in tax laws.From time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability.  The shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in recent years may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes.  If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income.  These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for payment of dividends. Loss of our key personnel could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our common stock.We are dependent on the efforts of Steven Roth, our Chief Executive Officer, and Michael D. Fascitelli, our President. While we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our common stock. ALEXANDERS CHARTER DOCUMENTS AND APPLICABLE LAW MAY HINDER ANY ATTEMPT TO AQUIRE US.Provisions in Alexanders certificate of incorporation and by laws, as well as provisions of the Code and Delaware corporate law, may delay or prevent a change of control of the Company or a tender offer, even if such action might be beneficial to stockholders, and limit the stockholders opportunity to receive a potential premium for their shares of common stock over then prevailing market prices. Primarily to facilitate maintenance of its qualification as a REIT, Alexanders certificate of incorporation generally prohibits ownership, directly, indirectly or beneficially, by any single stockholder of more than 9.9% of the outstanding shares of preferred stock of any class or 4.9% of outstanding common stock of any class.  The Board of Directors may waive or modify these ownership limits with respect to one or more persons if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of these limits will not jeopardize Alexanders status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.  In addition, the Board of Directors has, subject to certain conditions and limitations, exempted Vornado and certain of its affiliates from these ownership limitations.  Stocks owned in violation of these ownership limits will be subject to the loss of rights and other restrictions.  These ownership limits may havethe effect of inhibiting or impeding a change in control. Alexanders Board of Directors is divided into three classes of directors.  Directors of each class are chosen for three-year staggered terms.  Staggered terms of directors may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management, even though changes in management or a change in control might be in the best interest of our stockholders. In addition, Alexanders charter documents authorize the Board of Directors to:    cause Alexanders to issue additional authorized but unissued common stock or preferred stock;     classify or reclassify, in one or more series, any unissued preferred stock;     set the preferences, rights and other terms of any classified or reclassified stock that Alexanders issues; and     increase, without stockholder approval, the number of shares of beneficial interest that Alexanders may issue.   The Board of Directors could establish a series of preferred stock with terms that could delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Alexanders or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders, although the Board of Directors do not, at present, intend to establish a series of preferred stock of this kind.  Alexanders charter documents contain other provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of the Company or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. In addition, Vornado and Interstate (the three general partners of which are both trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexanders) together beneficially own approximately 60.3% of our outstanding shares of common stock.  This degree of ownership may also reduce the possibility of a tender offer or an attempt to change control of the Company. 12 We may change our policies without obtaining the approval of our stockholders.Our operating and financial policies, including our policies with respect to acquisitions of real estate or other assets, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and dividends, are exclusively determined by our Board of Directors.  Accordingly, our stockholders do not control these policies. OUR OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE AND RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS MAY GIVE RISE TO CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.Steven Roth, Vornado and Interstate may exercise substantial influence over us.  They and some of our other directors and officers have interests or positions in other entities that may compete with us.As of December 31, 2006, Interstate and its partners owned approximately 8.5% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and approximately 27.6% of our outstanding common stock.  Steven Roth, David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr. are the partners of Interstate.  Mr. Roth is the Chairman of our Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado and the Managing General Partner of Interstate.  Mr. Wight and Mr. Mandelbaum are both trustees of Vornado and members of our Board of Directors.  In addition, Vornado manages and leases the real estate assets of Interstate. As of December 31, 2006, Vornado owned 32.8% of our outstanding common stock, in addition to that owned by Interstate and its partners.  In addition to the relationships described in the immediately preceding paragraph, Michael D. Fascitelli, the President and a trustee of Vornado, is our President and a member of our Board of Directors. Richard West is a trustee of Vornado and a member of our Board of Directors.  In addition, Joseph Macnow, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, holds the same positions with Vornado. Because of their overlapping interests, Vornado, Mr. Roth, Interstate and the other individuals noted in the preceding paragraphs may have substantial influence over Alexanders, and on the outcome of any matters submitted to Alexanders stockholders for approval.  In addition, certain decisions concerning our operations or financial structure may present conflicts of interest among Vornado, Messrs. Roth, Mandelbaum and Wight and Interstate and other security holders.  Vornado, Mr. Roth and Interstate may, in the future, engage in a wide variety of activities in the real estate business which may result in conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting us, such as which of these entities or persons, if any, may take advantage of potential business opportunities, the business focus of these entities, the types of properties and geographic locations in whichthese entities make investments, potential competition between business activities conducted, or sought to be conducted, by us, competition for properties and tenants, possible corporate transactions such as acquisitions, and other strategic decisions affecting the future of these entities. There may be conflicts of interest between Vornado, its affiliates and us.Vornado manages, develops and leases our properties under agreements that have one-year terms expiring in March of each year, which are automatically renewable.  Because we share common senior management with Vornado and because five of the trustees of Vornado also constitute the majority of our directors, the terms of the foregoing agreements and any future agreements may not be comparable to those we could have negotiated with an unaffiliated third party. For a description of Interstates ownership of Vornado and Alexanders, see Steven Roth, Vornado and Interstate may exercise substantial influence over us.  They and some of our other directors and officers have interests or positions in other entities that may compete with us. above. 13 THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF ALEXANDERS COMMON STOCK AND THE MARKET FOR THOSE SHARES GIVE RISE TO VARIOUS RISKS.Alexanders has available for issuance, shares of its common stock and outstanding and exercisable options to purchase its common stock.  The issuance of this stock or the exercise of these options could decrease the market price of the shares of common stock currently outstanding.As of December 31, 2006, we had authorized but unissued 4,826,550 shares of common stock, par value of $1.00 per share and 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share.  In addition, as of December 31, 2006, 69,900 options were outstanding and exercisable at a weighted-average exercise price of $70.38 and as of December 31, 2006, 850,000 SARs were outstanding and exercisable at a weighted-average exercise price of $141.80.  Additionally, 895,000 shares are available for future grant under the terms of our Omnibus Stock Plan that may be in the form of options, restricted stock, SARs or other equity-based interests.  Since the SARs agreements require that they be settled in cash, the number of shares available for future grant under the terms of our Omnibus Stock Plan will increase upon the exercise of the outstanding SARs.  We cannot predict the impact that future issuancesof common or preferred stock or any exercise of outstanding options or grants of additional equity-based interests would have on the market price of our common stock. Changes in market conditions could decrease the market price of our securities.The value of our securities depends on various market conditions, which may change from time to time.  Among the market conditions that may affect the value of our securities are the following:     the extent of institutional investor interest in us;     the reputation of REITs generally and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate companies, and fixed income securities;     our financial condition and performance; and     general financial market conditions.   The stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies.  "
9,ALX,ALEXANDER'S INC,2006-02-27,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS          Set forth below are material factors that may adversely affect our business and operations. Real Estate Investments' Value and Income Fluctuate Due to Various Factors.          The value of real estate fluctuates depending on conditions in the general economy and the real estate business. These conditions may also limit our revenues andavailable cash.         Thefactors that affect the value of our real estate include, among other things: national,regional and local economic conditions; localconditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area; competitionfrom other available space; whethertenants and users such as customers and shoppers consider a property attractive; thefinancial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies or defaults; whetherwe are able to pass some or all of any increased operating costs through to tenants; howwell we manage our properties; fluctuationsin interest rates; changesin real estate taxes and other expenses; changesin market rental rates; thetiming and costs associated with property improvements and rentals; changesin taxation or zoning laws; governmentregulation; Alexander'sfailure to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust; availabilityof financing on acceptable terms or at all; consequencesof any armed conflict involving, or terrorist attacks against, the United States; ourability to secure adequate insurance; potentialliability under environmental or other laws or regulations; and generalcompetitive factors.         Therents we receive and the occupancy levels at our properties may decline as a result of adverse changes in any of these factors. If our rental revenues decline, we generally wouldexpect to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and distribute to our stockholders. In addition, some of our major expenses, including mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenancecosts, generally do not decline when the related rents decline.  We depend on leasing space to tenants on economically favorable terms and collecting rent from our tenants, who may not be able to pay.          Our financial results depend significantly on leasing space in our properties to tenants on economically favorable terms. In addition, because a substantialmajority of our income comes from renting of real property, our income, funds available to pay indebtedness and funds available for distribution to our stockholders will decrease if a significantnumber of our tenants cannot pay their rent or if we are not able to maintain our level of occupancy on favorable terms. If a tenant does not pay its rent, we might not be able to enforce our rightsas landlord without delays and might incur substantial legal and other costs.         Bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants may decrease our revenues, net income and available cash.        Fromtime to time, some of our tenants, have declared bankruptcy, and other tenants may declare bankruptcy or become insolvent in the future. If a major tenant declares bankruptcy orbecomes insolvent, the rental property at which it leases space may have lower revenues and operational difficulties. In the case of our shopping centers, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a majortenant could cause us to have difficulty leasing the remainder of the affected property. Our leases generally do not contain restrictions designed to ensure the creditworthiness of our tenants. As aresult, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant could result in a lower level of net income and funds available for the payment of our indebtedness or distribution to our stockholders. 7  Some of the our tenants represent a significant portion of our revenues. Loss of these tenant relationships or deterioration in the tenants' credit quality could adversely affect results.          Bloomberg L.P. accounted for 34% and 36% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Sears accounted for 11%of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004. If we fail to maintain a relationship with any of our significant tenants or fail to perform our obligations under agreementswith these tenants, or if any of these tenants fails or becomes unable to perform its obligations under the agreements, we expect that any one or more of these events would adversely affect ourresults of operations and financial condition.  Real estate is a competitive business.          We operate in a highly competitive environment. All of our properties are located in the greater New York City metropolitan area. We compete with a large numberof real estate property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments. Principal factors of competition are rents charged, attractiveness oflocation, the quality of the property and breadth and quality of services provided. Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of national and local economies, the financial condition andoperating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation and populationtrends.  We may incur costs to comply with environmental laws.          Our operations and properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment including air andwater quality, hazardous or toxic substances and health and safety. Under some environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean uphazardous or toxic substances released at a property. The owner or operator may also be held liable to a governmental entity or tothird parties for property damage or personal injuries and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by those parties because of the contamination. These laws often impose liabilitywithout regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the release of the substances or caused the release. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may impair ourability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. Other laws and regulations govern indoor and outdoor air quality including those that can require the abatementor removal of asbestos-containing materials in the event of damage, demolition, renovation or remodeling and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air. The maintenance andremoval of lead paint and certain electrical equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and underground storage tanks are also regulated by federal and state laws. We are also subject torisks associated with human exposure to chemical or biological contaminants such as molds, pollens, viruses and bacteria which, above certain levels, can be alleged to be connected to allergic orother health effects and symptoms in susceptible individuals. We could incur fines for environmental compliance and be held liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to the foregoingregulated substances or tanks or related claims arising out of environmental contamination or human exposure at or from our properties.         Eachof our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. Except as referenced below, the environmental assessments did not, as of thisdate, reveal any environmental condition material to our business. However, identification of new compliance concerns or undiscovered areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope ofcontamination, discovery of additional sites, human exposure to the contamination or changes in cleanup or compliance requirements could result in significant costs to us.         InJune 1997, the Kings Plaza Regional Shopping Center commissioned the Phase II Study to evaluate and delineate environmental conditions disclosed in a Phase I study. The resultsof the Phase II study indicated the presence of petroleum and bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate contamination in the soil and groundwater. We have delineated the contamination and havedeveloped a remediation approach, which is ongoing. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (""NYSDEC"") has approved a portion of the remediation approach. We accrued $2,675,000 inprevious years, of which $2,612,000 has been paid as of December 31, 2005, for our estimated obligation with respect to the cleanup of the site, and which includes costs of (i) remedialinvestigation, (ii) feasibility studies, (iii) remedial design, (iv) remedial action and (v) professional fees. If NYSDEC insists on a more extensive remediation approach,we could incur additional obligations. We can make no assurance that we will not incur additional environmental costs with respect to this property. 8  Some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance.          We carry comprehensive liability and all risk property insurance ((i) fire, (ii) flood, (iii) extended coverage, (iv) ""acts ofterrorism"" as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005 which expires in 2007, and (v) rental loss insurance) with respect to our assets.         OnJune 30, 2005, we renewed our annual all risk policy with limits of (i) $960,000,000 per occurrence including certified terrorist acts and $350,000,000 fornon-certified terrorist acts for its 731 Lexington Avenue property, and (ii) $510,000,000 per occurrence including certified terrorist acts and $350,000,000 fornon-certified terrorist acts for the remaining properties. To the extent that we incur losses in excess of our insurance coverage, these losses would be borne by us and could be material.         Ourdebt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties (which are generally non-recourse to Alexander's), contain customary covenants requiring us tomaintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage under these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in thefuture. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain, or if the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005 is not extended past 2007, it could adversely affect ourability to finance and/or refinance our properties.  Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs.          The Americans with Disabilities Act generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, be made accessible to disabled persons. Noncompliancecould result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. If, under the Americans with Disabilities Act, we are required to make substantialalterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well asthe amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders.         Ourproperties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. If we fail to comply with theserequirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. We do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significantunanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations. Our Investments Are Concentrated in the Greater New York City Metropolitan Area. Circumstances Affecting These Areas Generally Could Adversely Affect Our Business.   All of our properties are in the greater New York City metropolitan area and are affected by the economic cycles and risks inherent in that area.          During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, all of our revenues came from properties located in the greater New York City metropolitan area.Like other real estate markets, the real estate market in this area has experienced economic downturns in the past, and we cannot predict how economic conditions will impact this market in both theshort and long term. Declines in the economy or a decline in the real estate market in this area could hurt the value of our properties and our financial performance. The factors affecting economicconditions in this region include: businesslayoffs or downsizing; industryslowdowns; relocationsof businesses; changingdemographics; increasedtelecommuting and use of alternative work places; financialperformance and productivity of the publishing, advertising, financial, technology, retail, insurance and real estate industries; infrastructurequality; and anyoversupply of, or reduced demand for, real estate.         Itis impossible for us to assess the future effects of the current uncertain trends in the economic and investment climates of the greater New York City metropolitan region, and moregenerally of the United States, on the real estate market in this area. If these conditions persist, or if there is any local, national or global economic downturn, our businesses and futureprofitability may be adversely affected. 9  We are subject to risks that affect the general retail environment.          A substantial proportion of our properties are in the retail shopping center real estate market. This means that we are subject to factors that affect the retailenvironment generally, including the level of consumer spending and consumer confidence, the threat of terrorism and increasing competition from discount retailers, outlet malls, retail websites andcatalog companies. These factors could adversely affect the financial condition of our retail tenants and the willingness of retailers to lease space in our shopping centers.  Terrorist attacks, such as those of September 11, 2001 in New York City, may adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to generate cash flow.          All of our properties are located in the greater New York City metropolitan area. In the aftermath of any terrorist attacks, tenants in this area may choose torelocate their businesses to less populated, lower-profile areas of the United States that are not as likely to be targets of future terrorist activity and fewer customers may choose to patronizebusinesses in this area. This would trigger a decrease in the demand for space in these markets, which could increase vacancies in our properties and force usto lease our properties on less favorable terms. As a result, the value of our properties and the level of our revenues could decline materially. We May Acquire or Sell Additional Assets or Develop Additional Properties. Our Failure or Inability to Consummate These Transactions or Manage the Results of These TransactionsCould Adversely Affect Our Operations and Financial Results.   We may acquire or develop properties and this may create risks.          We may acquire or develop properties when we believe that an acquisition or development is consistent with our business strategies, although currently our statedbusiness strategy is not to engage in acquisitions. We may not, however, succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget. In addition, we may facecompetition in pursuing acquisition or development opportunities that could increase our costs. When we do pursue a project or acquisition, we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquiredproperties at rents sufficient to cover their costs of acquisition or development and operations. Difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and coulddivert management's attention. Acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in poorer than anticipated performance. Wemay abandon acquisition or development opportunities that we have begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and have devoted management time to a matter notconsummated.  It may be difficult to buy and sell real estate quickly.          Real estate investments are relatively difficult to buy and sell quickly. Consequently, we may have limited ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response tochanges in economic or other conditions. Our Organizational and Financial Structure Gives Rise to Operational and Financial Risks.   Alexander's depends on dividends and distributions from its direct and indirect subsidiaries. The creditors of these subsidiaries are entitled to amounts payable to them by the subsidiaries before thesubsidiaries may pay any dividends or distributions to Alexander's, Inc.          Substantially all of Alexander's properties and assets are held through subsidiaries. Alexander's depends on cash distributions and dividends from itssubsidiaries for substantially all of its cash flow. The creditors of each of its direct and indirect subsidiaries are entitled to payment of that subsidiary's obligations to them, when due andpayable, before that subsidiary may make distributions or dividendsto Alexander's. Thus, Alexander's ability to pay its indebtedness and to pay dividends, if any, to its security holders depends on its subsidiaries' ability to first satisfy their obligations to theircreditors.         Inaddition, Alexander's participation in any distribution of the assets of any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries upon the liquidation, reorganization or insolvency of thesubsidiary, is only after the claims of the creditors, including trade creditors, and preferred security holders, if any, of the applicable direct or indirect subsidiaries are satisfied. 10  Our existing financing documents contain covenants and restrictions that may restrict our operational and financial flexibility and restrict or prohibit our ability to make payments upon securities.          At December 31, 2005, substantially all of our properties were pledged to secure obligations under $1,079,465,000 of existing secured indebtedness. If wewere to fail to perform our obligations under existing indebtedness or become insolvent or were liquidated, secured creditors would be entitled to payment in full from the proceeds of the sale of thepledged assets prior to any proceeds being paid to other creditors or to any holders of our securities. In such an event, it is possible that we would have insufficient assets remaining to makepayments to a holder of our securities. In addition, the existing financing documents contain restrictive covenants which limit the ability to incur indebtedness and make prepayments of indebtedness.These covenants may significantly restrict our operational and financial flexibility and may restrict its ability to obtain additional financing or pursue other business activities that may bebeneficial.  We have indebtedness, and this indebtedness, and its cost, may increase.          As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately $1,079,465,000 in total debt outstanding. Our ratio of total debt to total enterprise value was 62.2% atDecember 31, 2005. ""Enterprise value"" means the market equity value of our common stock, plus debt, less cash and cash equivalents at such date. In addition, we have significant debt serviceobligations. For the year ended December 31, 2005, our scheduled cash payments for principal and interest were $70,216,000. In the future, we may incur additional debt, and thus increase theratio of total debt to total enterprise value. If our level of indebtedness increases there may be an increased risk of default that could adversely affect our financial condition and results ofoperations. In addition, in a rising interest rate environment, the cost of refinancing our existing debt and any new debt or market rate security or instrument may increase.  We have issued outstanding and exercisable stock appreciation rights. The exercise of these stock appreciation rights may impact our liquidity.          As of January 31, 2006, 850,000 stock appreciation rights (""SARs"") were outstanding and exercisable at a weighted-average exercise price of $141.80. Sincethe SARs agreements require that they be settled in cash, the Company would have had to pay $89,295,000 if the holders of these SARs had exercised their SARs on January 31, 2006. Any change inthe Company's stock price from the closing price of $246.85at January 31, 2006 would increase or decrease the amount the Company would have to pay upon exercise.  Alexander's might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT, and may be required to pay income taxes at corporate rates.          Although we believe that we will remain organized and will continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we might fail to remainqualified. Qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes is governed by highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the ""Code"") for which there are only limitedjudicial or administrative interpretations. Qualification as a REIT also depends on various facts and circumstances that are not entirely within our control. In addition, legislation, new regulations,administrative interpretations or court decisions might significantly change the tax laws with respect to the requirements for qualification as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences ofqualification as a REIT.         Inorder to qualify and maintain our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we are required, among other conditions, to distribute as dividends to our stockholders, atleast 90% of annual REIT taxable income. As of December 31, 2005, we had reported net operating loss carryovers (""NOLs"") of $31,739,000, which generally would be available to offset the amountof REIT taxable income that we otherwise would be required to distribute. However, the NOLs reported on the tax returns are not binding on the Internal Revenue Service and are subject to adjustment asa result of future audits. In addition, under Section 382 of the Code, the ability to use our NOLs could be limited if, generally, there are significant changes in the ownership of ouroutstanding stock. Since our reorganization as a REIT commencing in 1995, we have not paid regular dividends and do not believe that we will be required to, and may not, pay regular dividends untilthe NOLs have been fully utilized. 11  We face possible adverse changes in tax laws.          From time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. The shortfall in taxrevenues for states and municipalities in recent years may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on ourassets or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for payment of dividends.  Loss of our key personnel could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our common stock.          We are dependent on the efforts of Steven Roth, our Chief Executive Officer, and Michael D. Fascitelli, our President. While we believe that we could findreplacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our common stock. Alexander's charter documents and applicable law may hinder any attempt to acquire us.          Provisions in Alexander's certificate of incorporation and by laws, as well as provisions of the Code and Delaware corporate law, may delay or prevent a change ofcontrol over the Company or a tender offer, even if such action might be beneficial to stockholders, and limit the stockholders' opportunity to receive a potential premium for their shares of commonstock over then prevailing market prices.         Primarilyto facilitate maintenance of its qualification as a REIT, Alexander's certificate of incorporation generally prohibits ownership, directly, indirectly or beneficially, by anysingle stockholder of more than 9.9% of the outstanding shares of preferred stock of any class or 4.9% of outstanding common stock of any class. The Board of Directors may waive or modify theseownership limits with respect to one or more persons if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of these limits will not jeopardize Alexander's status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Inaddition, the Board of Directors has, subject to certain conditions and limitations, exempted Vornado and certain of its affiliates from these ownership limitations. Shares owned in violation of theseownership limits will be subject to the loss of rights and other restrictions. These ownership limits may have the effect of inhibiting or impeding a change in control.         Alexander'sBoard of Directors is divided into three classes of directors. Directors of each class are chosen for three-year staggered terms. Staggered terms of directors mayhave the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management, even though changes in management or a change in control might be in the best interest of our stockholders.         Inaddition, Alexander's charter documents authorize the Board of Directors to: causeAlexander's to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock; and setthe preferences, rights and other terms of any classified or reclassified shares that Alexander's issues without any further action by our stockholders.         TheBoard of Directors could establish a series of preferred stock whose terms could delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Alexander's or other transaction that might involve apremium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders, although the Board of Directors does not now intend to establish a series of preferred stock of this kind. Alexander's charterdocuments contain other provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of the Company or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest ofour stockholders.         Inaddition, Vornado and Interstate Properties (the three general partners of which are both trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexander's) together beneficially own approximately60.5% of our outstanding shares of common stock. This degree of ownership may also reduce the possibility of a tender offer or an attempt to change control of the Company. 12   We may change our policies without obtaining the approval of our stockholders.          Our operating and financial policies, including our policies with respect to acquisitions of real estate or other assets, growth, operations, indebtedness,capitalization and dividends, are exclusively determined by our Board of Directors. Accordingly, our stockholders do not control these policies. Our Ownership Structure and Related-Party Transactions May Give Rise to Conflicts of Interest.  Steven Roth, Vornado and Interstate may exercise substantial influence over us. They and some of our other directors and officers have interests or positions in other entitiesthat may compete with us.        Asof December 31, 2005, Interstate and its partners owned approximately 9.2% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado, our manager, and approximately 27.7% of theoutstanding common stock of Alexander's. Steven Roth, David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr. are the partners of Interstate. Mr. Roth is the Chairman of the Board of Directors and ChiefExecutive Officer of the Company, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado and the Managing General Partner of Interstate. Mr. Wight andMr. Mandelbaum are both trustees of Vornado and members of the Company's Board of Directors. In addition, Vornado manages and leases the real estate assets of Interstate.         Asof December 31, 2005, Vornado owned 33% of our outstanding common stock, in addition to that owned by Interstate and its partners. In addition to the relationships described inthe immediately preceding paragraph, Michael D. Fascitelli, the President and a trustee of Vornado, is our President and a member of our Board of Directors. Richard West is a trustee of Vornado and amember of our Board of Directors. In addition, Joseph Macnow, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, holds the same positions with Vornado.         Becauseof their overlapping interests, Mr. Roth, Interstate and the other individuals noted in the preceding paragraphs may have substantial influence over both Vornado andAlexander's, and on the outcome of any matters submitted to Vornado shareholders or Alexander's stockholders for approval. In addition, certain decisions concerning our operations or financialstructure may present conflicts of interest among Messrs. Roth, Mandelbaum and Wight and Interstate and other security holders. Mr. Roth and Interstate may, in the future, engage in awide variety of activities in the real estate business which may result in conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting Vornado or us, such as which of these entities or persons, if any,may take advantage of potential business opportunities, the business focus of these entities, the types of properties and geographic locations in which these entities make investments, potentialcompetition between business activities conducted, or sought to be conducted, by Vornado or us, competition for properties and tenants, possible corporate transactions such as acquisitions, and otherstrategic decisions affecting the future of these entities.  There may be conflicts of interest between Vornado, its affiliates and us.          Vornado manages, develops and leases our properties under agreements that have one-year terms expiring in March of each year, which are automaticallyrenewable. Because we and Vornado share common senior management and because five of the trustees of Vornado also constitute the majority of our directors, the terms of the foregoing agreements andany future agreements between us and Vornado and its affiliates may not be comparable to those we could have negotiated with an unaffiliated third party.         Fora description of Interstate's ownership of Vornado and Alexander's, see ""Steven Roth, Vornado and Interstate may exercise substantial influence over us. Theyand some of our other directors and officers have interests or positions in other entities that may compete with us."" above.13 The Number of Shares of Alexander's Common Stock and the Market for Those Shares Give Rise to Various Risks.  Alexander's has available for issuance shares of its common stock and outstanding and exercisable options to purchase its common stock. The issuance of this stock or theexercise of these options could decrease the market price of the shares of common stock currently outstanding.        Asof December 31, 2005, Alexander's had authorized but unissued 4,826,550 shares of its common stock, par value of $1.00 per share and 3,000,000 shares of its preferred stock,par value $1.00 per share. In addition, as of December 31, 2005, 81,850 options were outstanding and exercisable at a weighted-average exercise price of $70.38 and as of January 31,2006, 850,000 SARs were outstanding and exercisable at a weighted-average exercise price of $141.80. Additionally, 895,000 shares are available for future grant under the terms of our Omnibus StockPlan that may be in the form of options, restricted stock, SARs or other equity-based interests. Since the SARs agreements require that they be settled in cash, the number of shares available forfuture grant under the terms of our Omnibus Stock Plan will increase upon the exercise of the outstanding SARs. The Company cannot predict the impact that future issuances of common or preferred stockor any exercise of outstanding options or grants of additional equity-based interests would have on the market price of its common stock.  Changes in market conditions could decrease the market price of our securities.          The value of our securities depends on various market conditions, which may change from time to time. Among the market conditions that may affect the value of oursecurities are the following: theextent of institutional investor interest in us; thereputation of REITs generally and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other realestate companies, and fixed income securities; ourNOLs which are generally available to offset the amount of the REIT taxable income that we otherwise would be required to distribute as dividends; ourfinancial condition and performance; and generalfinancial market conditions.         Thestock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies"
