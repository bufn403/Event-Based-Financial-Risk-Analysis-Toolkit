11,BRN,BARNWELL INDUSTRIES,2023-12-18,"ITEM 1A.                         RISK FACTORS The business of Barnwell and its subsidiaries face numerous risks, including those set forth below or those described elsewhere in this Form 10-K or in Barnwell’s other filings with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only risks that Barnwell faces. If any of the following risk factors should occur, our profitability, financial condition or liquidity could be materially negatively impacted. Entity-Wide RisksStockholders may be diluted significantly through our efforts to obtain financing, satisfy obligations through the issuance of securities or use our stock as consideration in certain transactions.Our Board of Directors has authority, without action or vote of the stockholders, subject to the requirements of the NYSE American and applicable law, to issue all shares of our common stock or warrants or other instruments to purchase such shares of our common stock. In addition, we may raise capital by selling shares of our common stock, possibly at a discount to market in the future. These actions would result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing stockholders and may further dilute common stock book value, and that dilution may be material. A related effect of such issuances may enhance existing large stockholders’ influence on the Company, including that of Alexander Kinzler, our Chief Executive Officer.A small number of stockholders, including our CEO, own a significant amount of our common stock and may have influence over the Company. As of September 30, 2023, the CEO, who is a member of the Board of Directors, and two other stockholders hold approximately 44% of our outstanding common stock. The interests of one or more of these stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders. These stockholders have significant influence over all matters submitted to our stockholders, including the election of our directors, and could accelerate, delay, deter or prevent a change of control of the Company.Our operations are subject to currency rate fluctuations. Our operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar. Our financial statements, presented in U.S. dollars, may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk. Volatility in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations, particularly through the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar which may affect the relative prices at which we sell our oil and natural gas and may affect the cost of certain items required in our operations. To date, we have not entered into foreign currency hedging transactions to control or minimize these risks.Adverse changes in actuarial assumptions used to calculate retirement plan costs due to economic or other factors, or lower returns on plan assets could adversely affect Barnwell’s results and financial condition. Retirement plan cash funding obligations and plan expenses and obligations are subject to a high degree of uncertainty and could increase in future years depending on numerous factors, including the performance of the financial markets, specifically the equity markets, levels of interest rates, and the cost of health care insurance premiums.19The price of our common stock has been volatile and could continue to fluctuate substantially. The market price of our common stock has been volatile and could fluctuate based on a variety of factors, including: •fluctuations in commodity prices;•variations in results of operations;•announcements by us and our competitors;•legislative or regulatory changes;•general trends in the industry;•general market conditions; •litigation; and•other events applicable to our industries.  Failure to retain key personnel could hurt our operations. We require highly skilled and experienced personnel to operate our business. In addition to competing in highly competitive industries, we compete in a highly competitive labor market. Our business could be adversely affected by an inability to retain personnel or upward pressure on wages as a result of the highly competitive labor market. Further, there are significant personal liability risks to Barnwell of Canada's individual officers and directors related to well clean-up costs that may affect our ability to attract or retain the necessary people.We are a smaller reporting company and benefit from certain reduced governance and disclosure requirements, including that our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We cannot be certain if the omission of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.Currently, we are a “smaller reporting company,” meaning that our outstanding common stock held by nonaffiliates had a value of less than $250 million at the end of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, meaning our auditors are not required to attest to the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. As a result, investors and others may be less comfortable with the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls and the risk that material weaknesses or other deficiencies in internal controls go undetected may increase. In addition, as a smaller reporting company, we take advantage of our ability to provide certain other less comprehensive disclosures in our SEC filings, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements in annual reports and simplified executive compensation disclosures.  Consequently, it may be more challenging for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects, as the information we provide to stockholders may be different from what one might receive from other public companies in which one hold shares. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide this information.20We face various risks and uncertainties related to public health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences may have a material adverse effect on us. We face various risks and uncertainties related to public health crises, including the global COVID-19 pandemic, which has disrupted financial markets and significantly impacted worldwide economic activity. The future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as mandatory and voluntary actions taken to mitigate the public health impact of the pandemic may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. The COVID-19 pandemic and social and governmental responses to the pandemic have caused, and may continue to cause, severe economic, market and other disruptions worldwide. Although the COVID-19 pandemic and related societal and government responses have not, to date, had a material impact on our business or financial results, the extent to which COVID-19 and related actions may, in the future, impact our operations cannot be predicted with any degree of confidence. As a result, we cannot at this time predict the direct or indirect impact on us of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects.Risks Related to Oil and Natural Gas Segment Acquisitions or discoveries of additional reserves are needed to increase our oil and natural gas segment operating results and cash flow. In August 2018, Barnwell made a significant reinvestment into its oil and natural gas segment with the acquisition of the Twining property in Alberta, Canada. The Company believes there are potential undeveloped reserves for which significant future capital expenditures will be needed to convert those potential undeveloped reserves into developed reserves.  If future circumstances are such that we are not able to make the capital expenditures necessary to convert potential undeveloped reserves to developed reserves, we will not replace the amount of reserves produced and sold and our reserves and oil and natural gas segment operating results and cash flows will decline accordingly, and we may be forced to sell some of our oil and natural gas segment assets under untimely or unfavorable terms. Any such curtailment or sale could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Future oil and natural gas operating results and cash flow are highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves on an economic basis. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in developing or acquiring additional reserves and our current financial resources may be insufficient to make such investments. Furthermore, if oil or natural gas prices increase, our cost for additional reserves also could increase.  We may not realize an adequate return on oil and natural gas investments. Drilling for oil and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs. The wells we drill or participate in may not be productive, and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in those wells. If future oil and natural gas segment acquisition and development activities are not successful it could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. 21Oil and natural gas prices are highly volatile and further declines, or extended low prices will significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.  Much of our revenues and cash flow are greatly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas. Lower oil and natural gas prices not only decrease our revenues on a per unit basis, but also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce economically, if any. Prices that do not produce sufficient operating margins will have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, operating cash flows, borrowing ability, reserves, and the amount of capital that we are able to allocate for the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas reserves.Various factors beyond our control affect prices of oil and natural gas including, but not limited to, changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty, weather, worldwide political instability, foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the level of consumer product demand, government regulations and taxes, the price and availability of alternative fuels and the overall economic environment. Energy prices also are subject to other political and regulatory actions outside our control, which may include changes in the policies of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries or other developments involving or affecting oil-producing countries, or actions or reactions of the government of the U.S. in anticipation of or in response to such developments.The inability of one or more of our working interest partners to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results.For our operated properties, we pay expenses and bill our non-operating partners for their respective shares of costs. Some of our non-operating partners may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial obligations. Nonperformance by a non-operating partner could result in significant financial losses.Liquidity problems encountered by our working interest partners or the third party operators of our non-operated properties also may result in significant financial losses as the other working interest partners or third party operators may be unwilling or unable to pay their share of the costs of projects as they become due. In the event a third party operator of a non-operated property becomes insolvent, it may result in increased operating expenses and cash required for abandonment liabilities if the Company is required to take over operatorship.We may incur material costs to comply with or as a result of health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations. The oil and natural gas industry is subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to local, provincial and federal legislation. A violation of that legislation may result in the imposition of fines or the issuance of “clean up” orders. Legislation regulating the oil and natural gas industry may be changed to impose higher standards and potentially more costly obligations. Although we have recorded a provision in our financial statements relating to our estimated future environmental and reclamation obligations that we believe is reasonable, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to satisfy our actual future environmental and reclamation obligations. Barnwell's oil and natural gas segment is subject to the provisions of the AER’s Licensee Life-Cycle Management Program via a Licensee Capability Assessment (“LCA”). Under this program the AER assesses the corporate health of the Company and considers a wider variety of factors than those considered under the previous program. The LCA establishes clear expectations for industry with regards 22to the management of liabilities throughout the entire lifecycle of oil and gas projects.  Factors considered are grouped into six factor groups, these being current financial distress, liability magnitude, resources lifespan, operations compliance, closure efficiency and administrative compliance. These factors are compared to peer operators and ranked into three “Tiers”. Under the LCA Program, an inventory reduction program has also been implemented which requires mandatory annual minimum expenditures towards outstanding decommissioning and reclamation obligations in accordance with AER targets which are adjusted by the AER on an annual basis. The target for 2024 is 6.6% of an individual company’s inactive liability. These targets became effective January 1, 2022.The AER may require purchasers of AER licensed oil and natural gas assets to be within Tiers 1 or 2 overall rankings in the six factors group. This requirement for well transfers hinders our ability to generate capital by selling oil and natural gas assets as there are less qualified buyers. The AER may require the Company to provide a security deposit if assessed at Tier 3. Diverting funds to the AER in the future would result in the diversion of cash on hand and operating cash flows that could otherwise be used to fund oil and natural gas reserve replacement efforts, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If Barnwell fails to comply with the requirements of the LCA program, Barnwell's oil and natural gas subsidiary would be subject to the AER's enforcement provisions which could include suspension of operations and non-compliance fees and could ultimately result in the AER serving the Company with a closure order to shut-in all operated wells. Additionally, if Barnwell is non-compliant, the Company would be prohibited from transferring well licenses which would prohibit us from selling any oil and natural gas assets until the required cash deposit is made with the AER.  We are not fully insured against certain environmental risks, either because such insurance is not available or because of high premium costs. In particular, insurance against risks from environmental pollution occurring over time, as opposed to sudden and catastrophic damages, is not available on economically reasonable terms. Accordingly, any site reclamation or abandonment costs actually incurred in the ordinary course of business in a specific period could negatively impact our cash flow. Should we be unable to fully fund the cost of remedying an environmental problem, we might be required to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy. We may fail to fully identify potential problems related to acquired reserves or to properly estimate those reserves. We periodically evaluate acquisitions of reserves, properties, prospects and leaseholds and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategy. Our evaluation includes an assessment of reserves, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, potential for future drilling and production, validity of the seller’s title to the properties and potential environmental issues, litigation and other liabilities. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller of the properties may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We often are not entitled to contractual 23indemnification for environmental liabilities or title defects in excess of the amounts claimed by us before closing and acquire properties on an “as is” basis. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and future production rates and costs with respect to acquired properties, and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates.If oil and natural gas prices decline and remain low, we may be required to take write-downs of the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties. Oil and natural gas prices affect the value of our oil and natural gas properties as determined in our full cost ceiling calculation. Any future ceiling test write-downs will result in reductions of the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties and an equivalent charge to earnings. The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We compete for capital, acquisitions of reserves, undeveloped lands, skilled personnel, access to drilling rigs, service rigs and other equipment, access to processing facilities, pipeline capacity and in many other respects with a substantial number of other organizations, most of which have greater technical and financial resources than we do. Some of these organizations explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas, carry on refining operations and market oil and other products on a worldwide basis. As a result of these complementary activities, some of our competitors may have competitive resources that are greater and more diverse than ours. Furthermore, many of our competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production, such as changing prices and production levels, the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations. If our competitors are able to capitalize on these competitive resources, it could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. An increase in operating costs greater than anticipated could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Higher operating costs for our properties will directly decrease the amount of cash flow received by us. Electricity, supplies, and labor costs are a few of the operating costs that are susceptible to material fluctuation. The need for significant repairs and maintenance of infrastructure may increase as our properties age. A significant increase in operating costs could negatively impact operating results and cash flow.Our operating results are affected by our ability to market the oil and natural gas that we produce. Our business depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of oil and natural gas gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities. Canadian federal and provincial, as well as U.S. federal and state, regulation of oil and natural gas production, processing and transportation, tax and energy policies, general economic conditions, and changes in supply and demand could adversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas. If market factors change and inhibit the marketing of our production, overall production or realized prices may decline. 24We are not the operator and have limited influence over the operations of certain of our oil and natural gas properties. We hold minority interests in certain of our oil and natural gas properties. As a result, we cannot control the pace of exploration or development, major decisions affecting the drilling of wells, the plan for development and production at non-operated properties, or the timing and amount of costs related to abandonment and reclamation activities although contract provisions give Barnwell certain consent rights in some matters. The operator’s influence over these matters can affect the pace at which we incur capital expenditures. Additionally, as certain underlying joint venture data is not accessible to us, we depend on the operators at non-operated properties to provide us with reliable accounting information. We also depend on operators and joint operators to maintain the financial resources to fund their share of all abandonment and reclamation costs. Actual reserves will vary from reserve estimates. Estimating reserves is inherently uncertain and the reserves estimation process involves significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The reserve data and standardized measures set forth herein are only estimates. Ultimately, actual reserves attributable to our properties will vary from estimates, and those variations may be material. The estimation of reserves involves a number of factors and assumptions, including, among others: •oil and natural gas prices as prescribed by SEC regulations;•historical production from our wells compared with production rates from similar producing wells in the area;•future commodity prices, production and development costs, royalties and capital expenditures;•initial production rates;•production decline rates;•ultimate recovery of reserves;•success of future development activities;•marketability of production;•effects of government regulation; and•other government levies that may be imposed over the producing life of reserves. If these factors, assumptions and prices prove to be inaccurate, actual results may vary materially from reserve estimates.Part of our strategy involves using some of the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques. The results of our drilling are subject to drilling and completion technique risks, and results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production.     Many of our operations involve, and are planned to utilize, the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by our service providers in order to maximize production and ultimate recoveries and therefore generate the highest possible returns. Risks we face while completing our wells include, but are not limited to, the inability to fracture the planned number of stages, the inability to run tools and other equipment the entire length of the well bore during completion operations, the inability to recover such tools and other equipment, and the inability to successfully clean out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation. Ultimately, the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently 25long time period. If our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations, limited access to gathering systems and takeaway capacity, and/or prices for crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids decline, then the return on our investment for a particular project may not be as attractive as we anticipated and we could incur material write-downs of oil and gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future.    Production and reserves, if any, attributable to the use of enhanced recovery methods are inherently difficult to predict. If our enhanced recovery methods do not allow for the extraction of crude oil, natural gas, and associated liquids in a manner or to the extent that we anticipate, we may not realize an acceptable return on our investments in such projects.Delays in business operations could adversely affect the amount and timing of our cash inflows. In addition to the usual delays in payment by purchasers of oil and natural gas to the operators of our properties, and the delays of those operators in remitting payment to us, payments between any of these parties may also be delayed by: •restrictions imposed by lenders;•accounting delays;•delays in the sale or delivery of products;•delays in the connection of wells to a gathering system;•blowouts or other accidents;•adjustments for prior periods;•recovery by the operator of expenses incurred in the operation of the properties; and•the establishment by the operator of reserves for these expenses. Any of these delays could expose us to additional third party credit risks. The oil and natural gas market in which we operate exposes us to potential liabilities that may not be covered by insurance. Our operations are subject to all of the risks associated with the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties, including the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, and the production and transportation of oil and natural gas. These risks include encountering unexpected formations or pressures, premature declines of reservoirs, blow-outs, equipment failures and other accidents, cratering, sour gas releases, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, adverse weather conditions, pollution, other environmental risks, fires and spills. A number of these risks could result in personal injury, loss of life, or environmental and other damage to our property or the property of others. While we carry various levels of insurance, we could be affected by civil, criminal, regulatory or administrative actions, claims or proceedings. We cannot fully protect against all of the risks listed above, nor are all of these risks insurable. There is no assurance that any applicable insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability for the risks listed above. We could face substantial losses if an event occurs for which we are not fully insured or are not indemnified against or a customer or insurer fails to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations. In addition, there can be no assurance that insurance will continue to be available to cover any or all of these risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive.26 Deficiencies in operating practices and record keeping, if any, may increase our risks and liabilities relating to incidents such as spills and releases and may increase the level of regulatory enforcement actions. Our operations are subject to domestic and foreign government regulation and other risks, particularly in Canada and the U.S. Barnwell’s oil and natural gas operations are affected by political developments and laws and regulations, particularly in Canada and the U.S., such as restrictions on production, restrictions on imports and exports, the maintenance of specified reserves, tax increases and retroactive tax claims, expropriation of property, cancellation of contract rights, environmental protection controls, environmental compliance requirements and laws pertaining to workers’ health and safety. Further, the right to explore for and develop oil and natural gas on lands in Alberta is controlled by the government of that province. Changes in royalties and other terms of provincial leases, permits and reservations may have a substantial effect on Barnwell’s operations. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from our operations in Canada; 67% in fiscal 2023. Additionally, our ability to compete in the Canadian oil and natural gas industry may be adversely affected by governmental regulations or other policies that favor the awarding of contracts to contractors in which Canadian nationals have substantial ownership interests. Furthermore, we may face governmentally imposed restrictions or fees from time to time on the transfer of funds to the U.S. Government regulations control and often limit access to potential markets and impose extensive requirements concerning employee safety, environmental protection, pollution control and remediation of environmental contamination. Environmental regulations, in particular, prohibit access to some markets and make others less economical, increase equipment and personnel costs and often impose liability without regard to negligence or fault. In addition, governmental regulations may discourage our customers’ activities, reducing demand for our products and services. Legislation, regulation, and other government actions and shifting customer preferences and other private efforts related to greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and climate change could increase our operational costs and reduce demand for our oil and natural gas, resulting in a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.Barnwell may experience challenges from the impacts of international and domestic legislation, regulation, or other government actions relating to GHG emissions (e.g., carbon dioxide and methane) and climate change. International agreements and national, regional, and state legislation and regulatory measures that aim to directly or indirectly limit or reduce GHG emissions are in various stages of implementation. Many of these actions, as well as customers’ preferences and use of oil and natural gas or substitute products, are beyond the Company’s control. Similar to any significant changes in the regulatory environment, GHG emissions and climate change-related legislation, regulation, or other government actions may curtail profitability in the oil and gas sector, or render the extraction of the Company’s hydrocarbon resources economically infeasible. In particular, GHG emissions-related legislation, regulations, and other government actions and shifting consumer preferences and other private efforts aimed at reducing GHG emissions may result in increased and substantial capital, compliance, operating, and maintenance costs and could, among other things, reduce demand for the Company’s oil and natural gas; adversely affect the economic feasibility of the Company’s resources; impact or limit our 27business plans; and adversely affect the Company’s sales volumes, revenues, margins and reputation.The ultimate impact of GHG emissions and climate change-related agreements, legislation, regulation, and government actions on the Company’s financial performance is highly uncertain because the Company is unable to predict with certainty, the outcome of political decision-making processes, including the actual laws and regulations enacted, the variables and tradeoffs that inevitably occur in connection with such processes, and market conditions.Compliance with foreign tax and other laws may adversely affect our operations.Tax and other laws and regulations are not always interpreted consistently among local, regional and national authorities. Income tax laws, other legislation or government incentive programs relating to the oil and natural gas industry may in the future be changed or interpreted in a manner that adversely affects us and our stockholders. It also is possible that in the future we will be subject to disputes concerning taxation and other matters in Canada, including the manner in which we calculate our income for tax purposes, and these disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.Unforeseen title defects may result in a loss of entitlement to production and reserves. Although we conduct title reviews in accordance with industry practice prior to any purchase of resource assets or property, such reviews do not guarantee that an unforeseen defect in the chain of title will not arise and defeat our title to the purchased assets. If such a defect were to occur, our entitlement to the production from such purchased assets could be jeopardized. Risks Related to Land Investment Segment Receipt of future payments from KD I and KD II and cash distributions from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships is dependent upon the developer’s continued efforts and ability to develop and market the property. We are entitled to receive future payments based on a percentage of the sales prices of residential lots sold within the Kaupulehu area by KD I and KD II as well as a percentage of future distributions KD II makes to its members. However, in order to collect such payments we are reliant upon the developer, KD I and KD II, in which we own a non-controlling ownership interest, to continue to market the remaining lots within Increment I and to proceed with the development or sale of the remaining portion of Increment II. Additionally, future cash distributions from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships, which includes KD I and KD II, are also dependent on future lot sales in Increment I by KD I and the development or sale of Increment II by KD II. It is uncertain when or if KD II will develop or sell the remaining portion of Increment II, and there is no assurance with regards to the amounts of future sales from Increments I and II. We do not have a controlling interest in the partnerships, and therefore are dependent on the general partner for development decisions. The receipt of future payments and cash distributions could be jeopardized if the developer fails to proceed with development and marketing of the property. 28We hold investment interests in unconsolidated land development partnerships, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, in which we do not have a controlling interest. These investments involve risks and are highly illiquid. These investments involve risks which include: •the lack of a controlling interest in these partnerships and, therefore, the inability to require that the entities sell assets, return invested capital or take any other action without obtaining the majority vote of partners;•potential for future additional capital contributions to fund operations and development activities;•the adverse impact on overall profitability if the entities do not achieve the financial results projected;•the reallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives and/or an increase in indebtedness to pay potential future additional capital contributions, which could in turn restrict our ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of our business strategy;•undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems, unanticipated costs, and an inability to recover or manage such liabilities and costs and which could delay or prevent development of the real estate held by the land development partnerships; and•certain underlying partnership data is not accessible to us, therefore we depend on the general partner to provide us with reliable accounting information.Our land investment business is concentrated in the state of Hawaii. As a result, our financial results are dependent on the economic growth and health of Hawaii, particularly the island of Hawaii. Barnwell’s land investment segment is impacted by the condition of Hawaii’s real estate market, which is affected by Hawaii’s economy and Hawaii’s tourism industry, as well as the U.S. and world economies in general. Any future cash flows from Barnwell’s land development activities are subject to, among other factors, the level of real estate activity and prices, the demand for new housing and second homes on the island of Hawaii, the rate of increase in the cost of building materials and labor, the introduction of building code modifications, changes to zoning laws, and the level of confidence in Hawaii’s economy. The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business.The occurrence of a natural disaster in Hawaii such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse effect on our land investments. The occurrence of a natural disaster could also cause property and flood insurance rates and deductibles to increase, which could reduce demand for real estate in Hawaii. Risks Related to Contract Drilling Segment Demand for water well drilling and/or pump installation is volatile. A decrease in demand for our services could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. Demand for services is highly dependent upon land development activities in the state of Hawaii. The real estate development industry is cyclical in nature and is particularly vulnerable to shifts in local, regional, and national economic conditions outside of our control such as interest rates, housing demand, 29population growth, employment levels and job growth and property taxes. A decrease in water well drilling and/or pump installation contracts will result in decreased revenues and operating results.If we are unable to accurately estimate the overall risks, requirements or costs when bidding on or negotiating a contract that is ultimately awarded, we may achieve a lower than anticipated profit or incur a loss on the contract.Contracts are usually fixed price per lineal foot drilled and require the provision of line-item materials at a fixed unit price based on approved quantities irrespective of actual per unit costs. Under such contracts, prices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates, which are based on a number of assumptions, many of which are beyond our control. Expected profits on contracts are realized only if costs are accurately estimated and successfully controlled. We may not be able to obtain compensation for additional work performed or expenses incurred as a result of changes or inaccuracies in these estimates and underlying assumptions, such as unanticipated sub-surface site conditions, unanticipated technical problems, equipment failures, inefficiencies, cost of raw materials, schedule delays due to constraints on drilling hours, weather delays, or accidents. If cost estimates for a contract are inaccurate, or if the contract is not performed within cost estimates, then cost overruns may result in losses or cause the contract not to be as profitable as expected.A significant portion of our contract drilling business is dependent on municipalities and a decline in municipal spending could adversely impact our business. A significant portion of our contract drilling division revenues is derived from water and infrastructure contracts with governmental entities or agencies; 8% in fiscal 2023. Reduced tax revenues and governmental budgets may limit spending by local governments which in turn will affect the demand for our services. Material reductions in spending by a significant number of local governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial position. Our contract drilling operations face significant competition. We face competition for our services from a variety of competitors. Many of our competitors utilize drilling rigs that drill as quickly as our equipment but require less labor. Our strategy is to compete based on pricing and to a lesser degree, quality of service. If we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors, our financial results could be adversely affected. Supply chain and manufacturing issues of well drilling and pump installation equipment could adversely affect our operating results. We are dependent on various well drilling and pump installation equipment to conduct our contract drilling segment operations. The shortage of and/or delay in delivery of such equipment, such as pumps, interruptions in supply, and price increases of such equipment and materials due to supply chain issues and manufacturing disruptions could adversely impact our gross margin and results of operations.Awarding of contracts is dependent upon our ability to obtain contract bid and performance bonds from insurers. There can be no assurance that our ability to obtain such bonds will continue on the same basis as the past. Additionally, bonding insurance rates may increase and have an impact on our ability to win competitive bids, which could have a corresponding material impact on contract drilling operating results.30 The contracts in our backlog are subject to change orders and cancellation. Our backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under contracts that have been started and new contracts not yet started. Our contracts are subject to change orders and cancellations, and such changes could adversely affect our operations. The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business. The occurrence of a natural disaster in Hawaii such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete our contracts"
13,BRN,BARNWELL INDUSTRIES,2022-12-29,"ITEM 1A.                         RISK FACTORS The business of Barnwell and its subsidiaries face numerous risks, including those set forth below or those described elsewhere in this Form 10-K or in Barnwell’s other filings with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only risks that Barnwell faces. If any of the following risk factors should occur, our profitability, financial condition or liquidity could be materially negatively impacted. Entity-Wide RisksOur business operations and financial condition have been and may continue to be materially and adversely affected by the outbreak of novel strains of coronavirus.In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic and the U.S. and Canadian governments declared the virus a national emergency shortly thereafter. The ongoing global health crisis (including resurgences) resulting from the pandemic have, and continue to, disrupt the normal operations of many businesses, including the temporary closure or scale-back of business operations and/or the imposition of either quarantine or remote work or meeting requirements for employees, either by government order or on a voluntary basis. While the outbreak recently appeared to be trending downward, particularly as vaccination rates increased, new variants of COVID-19 continue emerging, including the Omicron variants, spreading throughout the U.S. and globally and causing significant disruptions. The global economy, our markets and our business have been, and may continue to be, materially and adversely affected by COVID-19.The COVID-19 outbreak materially and adversely affected our business operations and financial condition as a result of the deteriorating market outlook, the global economic recession and weakened liquidity. Although demand for oil and oil prices has increased significantly from the lows of March through May of 2020, uncertainty regarding future oil prices continues to exist. While the Company’s contract drilling segment remained operational throughout fiscal 2020 and 2021 and continues to work, the continuing potential impact of COVID-19 on the health of our contract drilling segment's crews is uncertain, and any work stoppage or discontinuation of contracts currently in backlog could result in a material adverse impact to the Company’s financial condition and outlook. Though availability of vaccines and reopening of state and local economies has improved the outlook for recovery from COVID-19's impacts, the impact of new, more contagious or lethal variants that may emerge, and the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against variants and the related responses by governments, including reinstated government-imposed lockdowns or other measures, cannot be predicted at this time.  Both the health and economic aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic remain highly fluid and the future course of each is uncertain. We cannot foresee whether the outbreak of COVID-19 will be effectively contained on a sustained basis, nor can we predict the severity and duration of its impact. If the impact of COVID-19 is not effectively and timely controlled on a sustained basis going forward, our business operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected by factors that we cannot foresee. Any of these factors and other factors beyond our control could have an adverse effect on the overall business environment, cause uncertainties in the regions where we conduct business, cause our business to suffer in ways that we cannot predict and materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.19There may be adverse effects on the value of your investment from our use of our Tax Benefits Preservation Plan.In October 2022, subsequent to the end of our 2022 fiscal year, our Board of Directors adopted a Tax Benefits Preservation Plan designed to protect the availability of the Company’s existing net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes by discouraging persons or groups of persons from acquiring ownership of our common stock in a manner that could trigger an “ownership change” for purposes of Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”).The Tax Benefits Preservation Plan may have an “anti-takeover effect” because it may deter a person or group of persons from acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.95% or more of our outstanding common stock or, in the case of a person or group of persons that already own 4.95% or more of our outstanding common stock, from acquiring any additional common stock. The Tax Benefits Preservation  Plan could discourage or prevent a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or accumulations of substantial blocks of shares of our common stock, and, notwithstanding its purpose, could adversely affect our stockholders’ ability to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price for our common stock in connection with any such transactions or actions. In addition, because our Board of Directors may consent to certain transactions, the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan gives our Board of Directors significant discretion over whether a potential acquirer’s efforts to acquire a large interest in us will be successful.Additionally, a stockholder’s ability to dispose of our common stock may be limited if the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan reduces the number of persons willing to acquire our common stock or the amount they are willing to acquire. Thus, the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan could severely reduce liquidity of our common stock, negatively impacting the value of your investment. A stockholder also may become a greater than 4.95% stockholder upon actions taken by persons related to, or affiliated with, that stockholder. Stockholders are advised to carefully monitor their ownership of our common stock and consult their own legal advisors and/or us to determine whether their ownership of common stock approaches the proscribed level.There can be no assurance that the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan will prevent an “ownership change” within the meaning of Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, in which case we may lose all or most of the anticipated tax benefits associated with our prior losses.Stockholders may be diluted significantly through our efforts to obtain financing, satisfy obligations through the issuance of securities or use our stock as consideration in certain transactions.Our Board of Directors has authority, without action or vote of the stockholders, subject to the requirements of the NYSE American and applicable law, to issue all shares of our common stock or warrants or other instruments to purchase such shares of our common stock. In addition, we may raise capital by selling shares of our common stock, possibly at a discount to market in the future. These actions would result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing stockholders and may further dilute common stock book value, and that dilution may be material. A related effect of such issuances may enhance existing large stockholders’ influence on the Company, including that of Alexander Kinzler, our Chief Executive Officer.20A small number of stockholders, including our CEO, own a significant amount of our common stock and may have influence over the Company. As of September 30, 2022, the CEO, who is a member of the Board of Directors, and two other stockholders hold approximately 39% of our outstanding common stock. The interests of one or more of these stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders. These stockholders have significant influence over all matters submitted to our stockholders, including the election of our directors, and could accelerate, delay, deter or prevent a change of control of the Company.Our operations are subject to currency rate fluctuations. Our operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar. Our financial statements, presented in U.S. dollars, may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk. Volatility in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations, particularly through the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar which may affect the relative prices at which we sell our oil and natural gas and may affect the cost of certain items required in our operations. To date, we have not entered into foreign currency hedging transactions to control or minimize these risks.Adverse changes in actuarial assumptions used to calculate retirement plan costs due to economic or other factors, or lower returns on plan assets could adversely affect Barnwell’s results and financial condition. Retirement plan cash funding obligations and plan expenses and obligations are subject to a high degree of uncertainty and could increase in future years depending on numerous factors, including the performance of the financial markets, specifically the equity markets, levels of interest rates, and the cost of health care insurance premiums.The price of our common stock has been volatile and could continue to fluctuate substantially. The market price of our common stock has been volatile and could fluctuate based on a variety of factors, including: •fluctuations in commodity prices;•variations in results of operations;•announcements by us and our competitors;•legislative or regulatory changes;•general trends in the industry;•general market conditions; •litigation; and•other events applicable to our industries.  21Failure to retain key personnel could hurt our operations. We require highly skilled and experienced personnel to operate our business. In addition to competing in highly competitive industries, we compete in a highly competitive labor market. Our business could be adversely affected by an inability to retain personnel or upward pressure on wages as a result of the highly competitive labor market. Further, there are significant personal liability risks to Barnwell of Canada's individual officers and directors related to well clean-up costs that may affect our ability to attract or retain the necessary people.We are a smaller reporting company and benefit from certain reduced governance and disclosure requirements, including that our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We cannot be certain if the omission of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.Currently, we are a “smaller reporting company,” meaning that our outstanding common stock held by nonaffiliates had a value of less than $250 million at the end of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, meaning our auditors are not required to attest to the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. As a result, investors and others may be less comfortable with the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls and the risk that material weaknesses or other deficiencies in internal controls go undetected may increase. In addition, as a smaller reporting company, we take advantage of our ability to provide certain other less comprehensive disclosures in our SEC filings, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements in annual reports and simplified executive compensation disclosures.  Consequently, it may be more challenging for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects, as the information we provide to stockholders may be different from what one might receive from other public companies in which one hold shares. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide this information.Risks Related to Oil and Natural Gas Segment Acquisitions or discoveries of additional reserves are needed to increase our oil and natural gas segment operating results and cash flow. In August 2018, Barnwell made a significant reinvestment into its oil and natural gas segment with the acquisition of the Twining property in Alberta, Canada. The Company believes there are potential undeveloped reserves for which significant future capital expenditures will be needed to convert those potential undeveloped reserves into developed reserves.  If future circumstances are such that we are not able to make the capital expenditures necessary to convert potential undeveloped reserves to developed reserves, we will not replace the amount of reserves produced and sold and our reserves and oil and natural gas segment operating results and cash flows will decline accordingly, and we may be forced to sell some of our oil and natural gas segment assets under untimely or unfavorable terms. Any such curtailment or sale could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Future oil and natural gas operating results and cash flow are highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves on an economic basis. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in developing or acquiring additional reserves and our current financial resources may 22be insufficient to make such investments. Furthermore, if oil or natural gas prices increase, our cost for additional reserves also could increase.  We may not realize an adequate return on oil and natural gas investments. Drilling for oil and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs. The wells we drill or participate in may not be productive, and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in those wells. If future oil and natural gas segment acquisition and development activities are not successful it could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. Oil and natural gas prices are highly volatile and further declines, or extended low prices will significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.  Much of our revenues and cash flow are greatly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas. Lower oil and natural gas prices not only decrease our revenues on a per unit basis, but also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce economically, if any. Prices that do not produce sufficient operating margins will have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, operating cash flows, borrowing ability, reserves, and the amount of capital that we are able to allocate for the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas reserves.Various factors beyond our control affect prices of oil and natural gas including, but not limited to, changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty, weather, worldwide political instability, foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the level of consumer product demand, government regulations and taxes, the price and availability of alternative fuels and the overall economic environment. Energy prices also are subject to other political and regulatory actions outside our control, which may include changes in the policies of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries or other developments involving or affecting oil-producing countries, or actions or reactions of the government of the U.S. in anticipation of or in response to such developments.The inability of one or more of our working interest partners to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results.For our operated properties, we pay expenses and bill our non-operating partners for their respective shares of costs. Some of our non-operating partners may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial obligations. Nonperformance by a non-operating partner could result in significant financial losses.Liquidity problems encountered by our working interest partners or the third party operators of our non-operated properties also may result in significant financial losses as the other working interest partners or third party operators may be unwilling or unable to pay their share of the costs of projects as they become due. In the event a third party operator of a non-operated property becomes insolvent, it may result in increased operating expenses and cash required for abandonment liabilities if the Company is required to take over operatorship.23We may incur material costs to comply with or as a result of health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations. The oil and natural gas industry is subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to local, provincial and federal legislation. A violation of that legislation may result in the imposition of fines or the issuance of “clean up” orders. Legislation regulating the oil and natural gas industry may be changed to impose higher standards and potentially more costly obligations. Although we have recorded a provision in our financial statements relating to our estimated future environmental and reclamation obligations that we believe is reasonable, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to satisfy our actual future environmental and reclamation obligations. Barnwell's oil and natural gas segment is subject to the provisions of the AER’s Licensee Life-Cycle Management Program via a Licensee Capability Assessment (“LCA”). Under this program the AER assesses the corporate health of the Company and considers a wider variety of factors than those considered under the previous program. The LCA establishes clear expectations for industry with regards to the management of liabilities throughout the entire lifecycle of oil and gas projects.  Factors considered are grouped into six factor groups, these being current financial distress, liability magnitude, resources lifespan, operations compliance, closure efficiency and administrative compliance. These factors are compared to peer operators and ranked into three “Tiers”. Under the LCA Program, an inventory reduction program has also been implemented which requires mandatory annual minimum expenditures towards outstanding decommissioning and reclamation obligations in accordance with five-year rolling spending targets which are currently forecasted by the AER to increase by approximately 9% per year. These targets became effective January 1, 2022.The AER may require purchasers of AER licensed oil and natural gas assets to be within Tiers 1 or 2 overall rankings in the six factors group. This requirement for well transfers hinders our ability to generate capital by selling oil and natural gas assets as there are less qualified buyers. The AER may require the Company to provide a security deposit if assessed at Tier 3. Diverting funds to the AER in the future would result in the diversion of cash on hand and operating cash flows that could otherwise be used to fund oil and natural gas reserve replacement efforts, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If Barnwell fails to comply with the requirements of the LCA program, Barnwell's oil and natural gas subsidiary would be subject to the AER's enforcement provisions which could include suspension of operations and non-compliance fees and could ultimately result in the AER serving the Company with a closure order to shut-in all operated wells. Additionally, if Barnwell is non-compliant, the Company would be prohibited from transferring well licenses which would prohibit us from selling any oil and natural gas assets until the required cash deposit is made with the AER.  We are not fully insured against certain environmental risks, either because such insurance is not available or because of high premium costs. In particular, insurance against risks from environmental pollution occurring over time, as opposed to sudden and catastrophic damages, is not available on economically reasonable terms. Accordingly, any site reclamation or abandonment costs actually incurred in the ordinary course of business in a specific period could negatively impact our cash flow. Should we be unable to fully fund the cost of remedying an environmental problem, we might be required to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy. 24We may fail to fully identify potential problems related to acquired reserves or to properly estimate those reserves. We periodically evaluate acquisitions of reserves, properties, prospects and leaseholds and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategy. Our evaluation includes an assessment of reserves, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, potential for future drilling and production, validity of the seller’s title to the properties and potential environmental issues, litigation and other liabilities. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller of the properties may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities or title defects in excess of the amounts claimed by us before closing and acquire properties on an “as is” basis. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and future production rates and costs with respect to acquired properties, and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates.If oil and natural gas prices decline, we may be required to take write-downs of the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties. Oil and natural gas prices affect the value of our oil and natural gas properties as determined in our full cost ceiling calculation. Any future ceiling test write-downs will result in reductions of the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties and an equivalent charge to earnings. The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We compete for capital, acquisitions of reserves, undeveloped lands, skilled personnel, access to drilling rigs, service rigs and other equipment, access to processing facilities, pipeline capacity and in many other respects with a substantial number of other organizations, most of which have greater technical and financial resources than we do. Some of these organizations explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas, carry on refining operations and market oil and other products on a worldwide basis. As a result of these complementary activities, some of our competitors may have competitive resources that are greater and more diverse than ours. Furthermore, many of our competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production, such as changing prices and production levels, the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations. If our competitors are able to capitalize on these competitive resources, it could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. An increase in operating costs greater than anticipated could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Higher operating costs for our properties will directly decrease the amount of cash flow received by us. Electricity, supplies, and labor costs are a few of the operating costs that are susceptible to material 25fluctuation. The need for significant repairs and maintenance of infrastructure may increase as our properties age. A significant increase in operating costs could negatively impact operating results and cash flow.Our operating results are affected by our ability to market the oil and natural gas that we produce. Our business depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of oil and natural gas gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities. Canadian federal and provincial, as well as U.S. federal and state, regulation of oil and natural gas production, processing and transportation, tax and energy policies, general economic conditions, and changes in supply and demand could adversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas. If market factors change and inhibit the marketing of our production, overall production or realized prices may decline. We are not the operator and have limited influence over the operations of certain of our oil and natural gas properties. We hold minority interests in certain of our oil and natural gas properties. As a result, we cannot control the pace of exploration or development, major decisions affecting the drilling of wells, the plan for development and production at non-operated properties, or the timing and amount of costs related to abandonment and reclamation activities although contract provisions give Barnwell certain consent rights in some matters. The operator’s influence over these matters can affect the pace at which we incur capital expenditures. Additionally, as certain underlying joint venture data is not accessible to us, we depend on the operators at non-operated properties to provide us with reliable accounting information. We also depend on operators and joint operators to maintain the financial resources to fund their share of all abandonment and reclamation costs. Actual reserves will vary from reserve estimates. Estimating reserves is inherently uncertain and the reserves estimation process involves significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The reserve data and standardized measures set forth herein are only estimates. Ultimately, actual reserves attributable to our properties will vary from estimates, and those variations may be material. The estimation of reserves involves a number of factors and assumptions, including, among others: •oil and natural gas prices as prescribed by SEC regulations;•historical production from our wells compared with production rates from similar producing wells in the area;•future commodity prices, production and development costs, royalties and capital expenditures;•initial production rates;•production decline rates;•ultimate recovery of reserves;•success of future development activities;•marketability of production;•effects of government regulation; and•other government levies that may be imposed over the producing life of reserves. If these factors, assumptions and prices prove to be inaccurate, actual results may vary materially from reserve estimates.26 Actual revenues and operating expenses for our Oklahoma properties may differ from our estimates.    As revenue and operating expense information from our royalty and non-operated working interest properties in Oklahoma are generally received several months after the production month, the Company accrues for revenue and operating expenses by estimating our share of production volumes and costs based on data provided by the operator of the properties and product spot prices, and are subsequently adjusted to actual amounts in the period of receipt of actual data. Any identified differences between estimated revenue and operating cost estimates and actual data historically have not been significant, however at this time there is limited history to date and thus there is no assurance that actual information will not vary significantly from our estimates.SEC rules could limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves (“PUDs”) in the future.     SEC rules require that, subject to limited exceptions, PUDs may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of booking. This requirement may limit our ability to book PUDs as we pursue our drilling program. Part of our strategy involves using some of the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques. The results of our drilling are subject to drilling and completion technique risks, and results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production.     Many of our operations involve, and are planned to utilize, the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by our service providers in order to maximize production and ultimate recoveries and therefore generate the highest possible returns. Risks we face while completing our wells include, but are not limited to, the inability to fracture the planned number of stages, the inability to run tools and other equipment the entire length of the well bore during completion operations, the inability to recover such tools and other equipment, and the inability to successfully clean out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation. Ultimately, the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period. If our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations, limited access to gathering systems and takeaway capacity, and/or prices for crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids decline, then the return on our investment for a particular project may not be as attractive as we anticipated and we could incur material write-downs of oil and gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future.    Production and reserves, if any, attributable to the use of enhanced recovery methods are inherently difficult to predict. If our enhanced recovery methods do not allow for the extraction of crude oil, natural gas, and associated liquids in a manner or to the extent that we anticipate, we may not realize an acceptable return on our investments in such projects.Delays in business operations could adversely affect the amount and timing of our cash inflows. In addition to the usual delays in payment by purchasers of oil and natural gas to the operators of our properties, and the delays of those operators in remitting payment to us, payments between any of these parties may also be delayed by:27 •restrictions imposed by lenders;•accounting delays;•delays in the sale or delivery of products;•delays in the connection of wells to a gathering system;•blowouts or other accidents;•adjustments for prior periods;•recovery by the operator of expenses incurred in the operation of the properties; and•the establishment by the operator of reserves for these expenses. Any of these delays could expose us to additional third party credit risks. The oil and natural gas market in which we operate exposes us to potential liabilities that may not be covered by insurance. Our operations are subject to all of the risks associated with the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties, including the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, and the production and transportation of oil and natural gas. These risks include encountering unexpected formations or pressures, premature declines of reservoirs, blow-outs, equipment failures and other accidents, cratering, sour gas releases, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, adverse weather conditions, pollution, other environmental risks, fires and spills. A number of these risks could result in personal injury, loss of life, or environmental and other damage to our property or the property of others. While we carry various levels of insurance, we could be affected by civil, criminal, regulatory or administrative actions, claims or proceedings. We cannot fully protect against all of the risks listed above, nor are all of these risks insurable. There is no assurance that any applicable insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability for the risks listed above. We could face substantial losses if an event occurs for which we are not fully insured or are not indemnified against or a customer or insurer fails to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations. In addition, there can be no assurance that insurance will continue to be available to cover any or all of these risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive. Deficiencies in operating practices and record keeping, if any, may increase our risks and liabilities relating to incidents such as spills and releases and may increase the level of regulatory enforcement actions. Our operations are subject to domestic and foreign government regulation and other risks, particularly in Canada and the U.S. Barnwell’s oil and natural gas operations are affected by political developments and laws and regulations, particularly in Canada and the U.S., such as restrictions on production, restrictions on imports and exports, the maintenance of specified reserves, tax increases and retroactive tax claims, expropriation of property, cancellation of contract rights, environmental protection controls, environmental compliance requirements and laws pertaining to workers’ health and safety. Further, the right to explore for and develop oil and natural gas on lands in Alberta is controlled by the government of that province. Changes in royalties and other terms of provincial leases, permits and reservations may have a substantial effect on Barnwell’s operations. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from our operations in Canada; 67% in fiscal 2022.28 Additionally, our ability to compete in the Canadian oil and natural gas industry may be adversely affected by governmental regulations or other policies that favor the awarding of contracts to contractors in which Canadian nationals have substantial ownership interests. Furthermore, we may face governmentally imposed restrictions or fees from time to time on the transfer of funds to the U.S. Government regulations control and often limit access to potential markets and impose extensive requirements concerning employee safety, environmental protection, pollution control and remediation of environmental contamination. Environmental regulations, in particular, prohibit access to some markets and make others less economical, increase equipment and personnel costs and often impose liability without regard to negligence or fault. In addition, governmental regulations may discourage our customers’ activities, reducing demand for our products and services. Legislation, regulation, and other government actions and shifting customer preferences and other private efforts related to greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and climate change could increase our operational costs and reduce demand for our oil and natural gas, resulting in a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.Barnwell may experience challenges from the impacts of international and domestic legislation, regulation, or other government actions relating to GHG emissions (e.g., carbon dioxide and methane) and climate change. International agreements and national, regional, and state legislation and regulatory measures that aim to directly or indirectly limit or reduce GHG emissions are in various stages of implementation. Many of these actions, as well as customers’ preferences and use of oil and natural gas or substitute products, are beyond the Company’s control. Similar to any significant changes in the regulatory environment, GHG emissions and climate change-related legislation, regulation, or other government actions may curtail profitability in the oil and gas sector, or render the extraction of the Company’s hydrocarbon resources economically infeasible. In particular, GHG emissions-related legislation, regulations, and other government actions and shifting consumer preferences and other private efforts aimed at reducing GHG emissions may result in increased and substantial capital, compliance, operating, and maintenance costs and could, among other things, reduce demand for the Company’s oil and natural gas; adversely affect the economic feasibility of the Company’s resources; impact or limit our business plans; and adversely affect the Company’s sales volumes, revenues, margins and reputation.The ultimate impact of GHG emissions and climate change-related agreements, legislation, regulation, and government actions on the Company’s financial performance is highly uncertain because the Company is unable to predict with certainty, the outcome of political decision-making processes, including the actual laws and regulations enacted, the variables and tradeoffs that inevitably occur in connection with such processes, and market conditions.Compliance with foreign tax and other laws may adversely affect our operations.Tax and other laws and regulations are not always interpreted consistently among local, regional and national authorities. Income tax laws, other legislation or government incentive programs relating to the oil and natural gas industry may in the future be changed or interpreted in a manner that adversely affects us and our stockholders. It also is possible that in the future we will be subject to disputes concerning taxation and other matters in Canada, including the manner in which we calculate our income for tax purposes, and these disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.29Unforeseen title defects may result in a loss of entitlement to production and reserves. Although we conduct title reviews in accordance with industry practice prior to any purchase of resource assets or property, such reviews do not guarantee that an unforeseen defect in the chain of title will not arise and defeat our title to the purchased assets. If such a defect were to occur, our entitlement to the production from such purchased assets could be jeopardized. Risks Related to Land Investment Segment Receipt of future payments from KD I and KD II and cash distributions from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships is dependent upon the developer’s continued efforts and ability to develop and market the property. We are entitled to receive future payments based on a percentage of the sales prices of residential lots sold within the Kaupulehu area by KD I and KD II as well as a percentage of future distributions KD II makes to its members. However, in order to collect such payments we are reliant upon the developer, KD I and KD II, in which we own a non-controlling ownership interest, to continue to market the remaining lots within Increment I and to proceed with the development or sale of the remaining portion of Increment II. Additionally, future cash distributions from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships, which includes KD I and KD II, are also dependent on future lot sales in Increment I by KD I and the development or sale of Increment II by KD II. It is uncertain when or if KD II will develop or sell the remaining portion of Increment II, and there is no assurance with regards to the amounts of future sales from Increments I and II. We do not have a controlling interest in the partnerships, and therefore are dependent on the general partner for development decisions. The receipt of future payments and cash distributions could be jeopardized if the developer fails to proceed with development and marketing of the property. We hold investment interests in unconsolidated land development partnerships, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, in which we do not have a controlling interest. These investments involve risks and are highly illiquid. These investments involve risks which include: •the lack of a controlling interest in these partnerships and, therefore, the inability to require that the entities sell assets, return invested capital or take any other action without obtaining the majority vote of partners;•potential for future additional capital contributions to fund operations and development activities;•the adverse impact on overall profitability if the entities do not achieve the financial results projected;•the reallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives and/or an increase in indebtedness to pay potential future additional capital contributions, which could in turn restrict our ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of our business strategy;•undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems, unanticipated costs, and an inability to recover or manage such liabilities and costs and which could delay or prevent development of the real estate held by the land development partnerships; and•certain underlying partnership data is not accessible to us, therefore we depend on the general partner to provide us with reliable accounting information.30Our land investment business is concentrated in the state of Hawaii. As a result, our financial results are dependent on the economic growth and health of Hawaii, particularly the island of Hawaii. Barnwell’s land investment segment is impacted by the condition of Hawaii’s real estate market, which is affected by Hawaii’s economy and Hawaii’s tourism industry, as well as the U.S. and world economies in general. Any future cash flows from Barnwell’s land development activities are subject to, among other factors, the level of real estate activity and prices, the demand for new housing and second homes on the island of Hawaii, the rate of increase in the cost of building materials and labor, the introduction of building code modifications, changes to zoning laws, and the level of confidence in Hawaii’s economy. The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business.The occurrence of a natural disaster in Hawaii such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse effect on our land investments. The occurrence of a natural disaster could also cause property and flood insurance rates and deductibles to increase, which could reduce demand for real estate in Hawaii. Risks Related to Contract Drilling Segment Demand for water well drilling and/or pump installation is volatile. A decrease in demand for our services could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. Demand for services is highly dependent upon land development activities in the state of Hawaii. The real estate development industry is cyclical in nature and is particularly vulnerable to shifts in local, regional, and national economic conditions outside of our control such as interest rates, housing demand, population growth, employment levels and job growth and property taxes. A decrease in water well drilling and/or pump installation contracts will result in decreased revenues and operating results.If we are unable to accurately estimate the overall risks, requirements or costs when bidding on or negotiating a contract that is ultimately awarded, we may achieve a lower than anticipated profit or incur a loss on the contract.Contracts are usually fixed price per lineal foot drilled and require the provision of line-item materials at a fixed unit price based on approved quantities irrespective of actual per unit costs. Under such contracts, prices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates, which are based on a number of assumptions, many of which are beyond our control. Expected profits on contracts are realized only if costs are accurately estimated and successfully controlled. We may not be able to obtain compensation for additional work performed or expenses incurred as a result of changes or inaccuracies in these estimates and underlying assumptions, such as unanticipated sub-surface site conditions, unanticipated technical problems, equipment failures, inefficiencies, cost of raw materials, schedule delays due to constraints on drilling hours, weather delays, or accidents. If cost estimates for a contract are inaccurate, or if the contract is not performed within cost estimates, then cost overruns may result in losses or cause the contract not to be as profitable as expected.31A significant portion of our contract drilling business is dependent on municipalities and a decline in municipal spending could adversely impact our business. A significant portion of our contract drilling division revenues is derived from water and infrastructure contracts with governmental entities or agencies; 59% in fiscal 2022. Reduced tax revenues and governmental budgets may limit spending by local governments which in turn will affect the demand for our services. Material reductions in spending by a significant number of local governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial position. Our contract drilling operations face significant competition. We face competition for our services from a variety of competitors. Many of our competitors utilize drilling rigs that drill as quickly as our equipment but require less labor. Our strategy is to compete based on pricing and to a lesser degree, quality of service. If we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors, our financial results could be adversely affected. Supply chain and manufacturing issues of well drilling and pump installation equipment could adversely affect our operating results. We are dependent on various well drilling and pump installation equipment to conduct our contract drilling segment operations. The shortage of and/or delay in delivery of such equipment, such as pumps, interruptions in supply, and price increases of such equipment and materials due to supply chain issues and manufacturing disruptions could adversely impact our gross margin and results of operations.Awarding of contracts is dependent upon our ability to obtain contract bid and performance bonds from insurers. There can be no assurance that our ability to obtain such bonds will continue on the same basis as the past. Additionally, bonding insurance rates may increase and have an impact on our ability to win competitive bids, which could have a corresponding material impact on contract drilling operating results. The contracts in our backlog are subject to change orders and cancellation. Our backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under contracts that have been started and new contracts not yet started. Our contracts are subject to change orders and cancellations, and such changes could adversely affect our operations. The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business. The occurrence of a natural disaster in Hawaii such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete our contracts"
15,BRN,BARNWELL INDUSTRIES,2021-12-21,"ITEM 1A.                         RISK FACTORS The business of Barnwell and its subsidiaries face numerous risks, including those set forth below or those described elsewhere in this Form 10-K or in Barnwell’s other filings with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only risks that Barnwell faces. If any of the following risk factors should occur, our profitability, financial condition or liquidity could be materially negatively impacted. Entity-Wide RisksOur business operations and financial condition have been and may continue to be materially and adversely affected by the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, which resulted in the global health pandemic referred to as COVID-19.In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic and the United States and Canadian governments declared the virus a national emergency shortly thereafter. The ongoing global health crisis (including resurgences) resulting from the pandemic have, and continue to, disrupt the normal operations of many businesses, including the temporary closure or scale-back of business operations and/or the imposition of either quarantine or remote work or meeting requirements for employees, either by government order or on a voluntary basis. While the outbreak recently appeared to be trending downward, particularly as vaccination rates increased, new variants of COVID-19 continue emerging, including the highly transmissible Delta variant and the newly-discovered Omicron variant (currently a “variant of concern”), spreading throughout the U.S. and globally and causing significant uncertainty. The global economy, our markets and our business have been, and may continue to be, materially and adversely affected by COVID-19.The COVID-19 outbreak materially and adversely affected our business operations and financial condition as a result of the deteriorating market outlook, the global economic recession and weakened liquidity. Although demand for oil and oil prices has recovered from the lows of March through May of the prior year, uncertainty regarding future oil prices has impacted and continues to impact the Company’s financial condition and outlook. While the Company’s contract drilling segment remained operational throughout fiscal 2020 and 2021 and continues to work, the continuing potential impact of COVID-19 on the health of our contract drilling segment's crews and ability or desire for customers to continue such work is uncertain, and any discontinuation of contracts currently in backlog would result in a material adverse impact to the Company’s financial condition and outlook. Though availability of vaccines and reopening of state and local economies has improved the outlook for recovery from COVID-19's impacts, the impact of the Delta or Omicron variant or other new, more contagious or lethal variants that may emerge, the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against the Delta or Omicron variant or such other variants and the related responses by governments, including reinstated government-imposed lockdowns or other measures, cannot be predicted at this time.  Both the health and economic aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic remain highly fluid and the future course of each is uncertain. We cannot foresee whether the outbreak of COVID-19 will be effectively contained on a sustained basis, nor can we predict the severity and duration of its impact. If the outbreak of COVID-19 is not effectively and timely controlled on a sustained basis going forward, our business operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected by factors that we cannot foresee. Any of these factors and other factors beyond our control could have an adverse effect on the overall business environment, cause uncertainties in the regions where we conduct business, cause our business to suffer in ways that we cannot predict and materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.20We are subject to the Continued Listing Criteria of the NYSE American and our failure to maintain continued compliance with the listing requirements of the NYSE American exchange could result in the delisting of our common stock.Our common stock is listed on the NYSE American. In order to maintain this listing, we must maintain certain share prices, financial and share distribution targets, including maintaining a minimum amount of stockholders’ equity and a minimum number of public stockholders. In addition to these objective standards, the NYSE American may delist the securities of any issuer if, in its opinion, the issuer’s financial condition and/or operating results appear unsatisfactory; if it appears that the extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of the security has become so reduced as to make continued listing on the NYSE American inadvisable; if the issuer sells or disposes of principal operating assets or ceases to be an operating company; if an issuer fails to comply with the NYSE American’s listing requirements; if an issuer’s common stock sells at what the NYSE American considers a “low selling price” (generally trading below $0.20 per share for an extended period of time); or if any other event occurs or any condition exists which makes continued listing on the NYSE American, in its opinion, inadvisable.On January 13, 2020, the Company received notice from the NYSE American that the Company was not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(i) and Section 1003(a)(ii) of the NYSE American Company Guide (the “Guide”), which respectively require an issuer to have (i) stockholders’ equity of $2.0 million or more if such issuer reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in two of its three most recent fiscal years and (ii) stockholders’ equity of $4.0 million or more if such issuer reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in three of its four most recent fiscal years, since we reported stockholders’ equity of $1.2 million as of September 30, 2019 and net losses in three of the last four most recent fiscal years then ended, and that the Company’s common stock could be at risk of being delisted.In accordance with the NYSE American’s policies and procedures, we subsequently submitted a plan (the “Plan”) to the NYSE American detailing the steps we planned to take to raise our stockholders’ equity above $4.0 million and regain compliance with Section 1003(a)(i) and Section 1003(a)(ii) of the Guide. On April 2, 2020, the NYSE American notified the Company that it accepted the Plan and granted the Company an extension for its continued listing until July 13, 2021.On July 13, 2021, the Company filed a Form 8-K report with the Securities and Exchange Commission announcing that the Company’s pro forma stockholders’ equity (unaudited) as of July 13, 2021 was projected to be above the $4.0 million required to comply with Section 1003(a)(i) and Section 1003(a)(ii) of the Guide. Accordingly, in a letter dated July 14, 2021, the NYSE American determined the Company had resolved the continued listing deficiency with respect to Section 1003(a)(i) and Section 1003(a)(ii) of the Guide and notified the Company that it had successfully regained compliance with the NYSE American continued listing standards.  Accordingly, the Company continues to be subject to the normal continued listing criteria of the NYSE American.  However, if the company, within 12 months of July 14, 2021, is again determined to be below any of the continued listing standards, the NYSE American staff will examine the relationship between the two incidents of falling below continued listing standards and re-evaluate the Company's method of financial recovery from the first incident. It will then take appropriate action, which, depending upon the circumstances, may include truncating the procedures described above or immediately initiating delisting proceedings.  If the NYSE American delists our common stock, investors may face material adverse consequences, including, but not limited to, a lack of a trading market for our common stock, reduced liquidity, and an inability for us to obtain financing to fund our operations.21Stockholders may be diluted significantly through our efforts to obtain financing and satisfy obligations through the issuance of securities.Our Board of Directors has authority, without action or vote of the stockholders, subject to the requirements of the NYSE American (which generally require stockholder approval for any transactions which would result in the issuance of more than 20% of our then outstanding shares of common stock or voting rights representing over 20% of our then outstanding shares of stock, subject to certain exceptions, including sales in public offerings and/or sales which are undertaken at or above the greater of the book value and/or market value of the issuer’s common stock on the date the transaction is agreed to be completed), to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued shares of common stock or warrants to purchase such shares of common stock. In addition, we may attempt to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock, possibly at a discount to market in the future. These actions would result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing stockholders and may further dilute common stock book value, and that dilution may be material. A related effect of such issuances may enhance existing large stockholders’ influence on the Company, including that of Alexander Kinzler, our Chief Executive Officer.A small number of stockholders, including our CEO, own a significant amount of our common stock and have influence over our business regardless of the opposition of other stockholders. As of September 30, 2021, the CEO, who is a member of the Board of Directors, and two other stockholders hold approximately 39% of our outstanding common stock. The interests of one or more of these stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders. These stockholders have significant influence over all matters submitted to our stockholders, including the election of our directors, and could accelerate, delay, deter or prevent a change of control of the Company. The significant stockholders who are also members of the Board of Directors could significantly affect our business, policies and affairs.Our operations are subject to currency rate fluctuations. Our operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar. Our financial statements, presented in U.S. dollars, may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk. Volatility in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations, particularly through the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar which may affect the relative prices at which we sell our oil and natural gas and may affect the cost of certain items required in our operations. To date, we have not entered into foreign currency hedging transactions to control or minimize these risks.Adverse changes in actuarial assumptions used to calculate retirement plan costs due to economic or other factors, or lower returns on plan assets could adversely affect Barnwell’s results and financial condition. Retirement plan cash funding obligations and plan expenses and obligations are subject to a high degree of uncertainty and could increase in future years depending on numerous factors, including the performance of the financial markets, specifically the equity markets, levels of interest rates, and the cost of health care insurance premiums.22The price of our common stock has been volatile and could continue to fluctuate substantially. The market price of our common stock has been volatile and could fluctuate based on a variety of factors, including: •fluctuations in commodity prices;•variations in results of operations;•announcements by us and our competitors;•legislative or regulatory changes;•general trends in the industry;•general market conditions; •litigation; and•other events applicable to our industries.  Failure to retain key personnel could hurt our operations. We require highly skilled and experienced personnel to operate our business. In addition to competing in highly competitive industries, we compete in a highly competitive labor market. Our business could be adversely affected by an inability to retain personnel or upward pressure on wages as a result of the highly competitive labor market. Further, there are significant personal liability risks to Barnwell of Canada's individual officers and directors related to well clean-up costs that may affect our ability to attract or retain the necessary people.We are a smaller reporting company and benefit from certain reduced governance and disclosure requirements, including that our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We cannot be certain if the omission of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.Currently, we are a “smaller reporting company,” meaning that our outstanding common stock held by nonaffiliates had a value of less than $250 million at the end of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, meaning our auditors are not required to attest to the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. As a result, investors and others may be less comfortable with the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls and the risk that material weaknesses or other deficiencies in internal controls go undetected may increase. In addition, as a smaller reporting company, we take advantage of our ability to provide certain other less comprehensive disclosures in our SEC filings, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements in annual reports and simplified executive compensation disclosures.  Consequently, it may be more challenging for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects, as the information we provide to stockholders may be different from what one might receive from other public companies in which one hold shares. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide this information.23Risks Related to Oil and Natural Gas Segment Acquisitions or discoveries of additional reserves are needed to increase our oil and natural gas segment operating results and cash flow. In August 2018, Barnwell made a significant reinvestment into its oil and natural gas segment with the acquisition of the Twining property in Alberta, Canada. The Company believes there are potential undeveloped reserves for which significant future capital expenditures will be needed to convert those potential undeveloped reserves into developed reserves.  If future circumstances are such that we are not able to make the capital expenditures necessary to convert potential undeveloped reserves to developed reserves, we will not replace the amount of reserves produced and sold and our reserves and oil and natural gas segment operating results and cash flows will decline accordingly, and we may be forced to sell some of our oil and natural gas segment assets under untimely or unfavorable terms. Any such curtailment or sale could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Future oil and natural gas operating results and cash flow are highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves on an economic basis. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in developing or acquiring additional reserves and our current financial resources may be insufficient to make such investments. Furthermore, if oil or natural gas prices increase, our cost for additional reserves could also increase.  We may not realize an adequate return on oil and natural gas investments. Drilling for oil and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs. The wells we drill or participate in may not be productive, and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in those wells. If future oil and natural gas segment acquisition and development activities are not successful it could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. Oil and natural gas prices are highly volatile and further declines, or extended low prices will significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.  Much of our revenues and cash flow are greatly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas. Lower oil and natural gas prices not only decrease our revenues on a per unit basis, but also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce economically, if any. Prices that do not produce sufficient operating margins will have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, operating cash flows, borrowing ability, reserves, and the amount of capital that we are able to allocate for the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas reserves.Various factors beyond our control affect prices of oil and natural gas including, but not limited to, changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty, weather, worldwide political instability, foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the level of consumer product demand, government regulations and taxes, the price and availability of alternative fuels and the overall economic environment. Energy prices are also subject to other political and regulatory actions outside our control, which may include changes in the policies of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries or other developments involving or affecting oil-producing countries, or actions or reactions of the government of the United States in anticipation of or in response to such developments.24The inability of one or more of our working interest partners to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results.For our operated properties, we pay expenses and bill our non-operating partners for their respective shares of costs. Some of our non-operating partners may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial obligations. Nonperformance by a non-operating partner could result in significant financial losses.Liquidity problems encountered by our working interest partners or the third party operators of our non-operated properties may also result in significant financial losses as the other working interest partners or third party operators may be unwilling or unable to pay their share of the costs of projects as they become due. In the event a third party operator of a non-operated property becomes insolvent, it may result in increased operating expenses and cash required for abandonment liabilities if the Company is required to take over operatorship. Barnwell holds an 11% working interest, the largest working interest other than that held by the operator, in a property with approximately 82 wells and 7 facilities where the operator is in receivership.We may incur material costs to comply with or as a result of health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations. The oil and natural gas industry is subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to local, provincial and federal legislation. A violation of that legislation may result in the imposition of fines or the issuance of “clean up” orders. Legislation regulating the oil and natural gas industry may be changed to impose higher standards and potentially more costly obligations. Although we have recorded a provision in our financial statements relating to our estimated future environmental and reclamation obligations that we believe is reasonable, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to satisfy our actual future environmental and reclamation obligations. Barnwell's oil and natural gas segment is subject to the provisions of the AER’s LLR program. Under the LLR program the AER calculates a LMR for a company based on the ratio of the company’s deemed assets over its deemed liabilities relating to wells and facilities for which the company is the licensed operator and imposes a security deposit on operators whose estimated liabilities exceed their deemed asset value. At September 30, 2021, the Company had sufficient deemed asset value that no security deposit was due. However, decreases in prices and production and related netbacks from relevant properties could result in a decline in the Company's deemed asset value to a point where a deposit could be due in the future. The current liability framework is under revision by the AER. A percentage-based retirement framework is expected to be introduced, but further details are unknown at this time. The AER requires purchasers of AER licensed oil and natural gas assets to have an LMR of 2.0 or higher immediately following the transfer of a license. This LMR requirement for well transfers hinders our ability to generate capital by selling oil and natural gas assets as there are less qualified buyers. A requirement to provide security deposit funds to the AER in the future would result in the diversion of cash on hand and operating cash flows that could otherwise be used to fund oil and natural gas reserve replacement efforts, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If Barnwell fails to comply with the requirements of the LLR program, Barnwell's oil and natural gas subsidiary would be subject to the AER's enforcement provisions which could include suspension of operations and non-compliance fees and could ultimately result in the 25AER serving the Company with a closure order to shut-in all operated wells. Additionally, if Barnwell is non-compliant, the Company would be prohibited from transferring well licenses which would prohibit us from selling any oil and natural gas assets until the required cash deposit is made with the AER.  We are not fully insured against certain environmental risks, either because such insurance is not available or because of high premium costs. In particular, insurance against risks from environmental pollution occurring over time, as opposed to sudden and catastrophic damages, is not available on economically reasonable terms. Accordingly, any site reclamation or abandonment costs actually incurred in the ordinary course of business in a specific period could negatively impact our cash flow. Should we be unable to fully fund the cost of remedying an environmental problem, we might be required to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy. We may fail to fully identify potential problems related to acquired reserves or to properly estimate those reserves. We periodically evaluate acquisitions of reserves, properties, prospects and leaseholds and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategy. Our evaluation includes an assessment of reserves, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, potential for future drilling and production, validity of the seller’s title to the properties and potential environmental issues, litigation and other liabilities. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities or title defects in excess of the amounts claimed by us before closing and acquire properties on an “as is” basis. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and future production rates and costs with respect to acquired properties, and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates.If oil and natural gas prices decline, we may be required to take write-downs of the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties. Oil and natural gas prices affect the value of our oil and natural gas properties as determined in our full cost ceiling calculation. Any future ceiling test write-downs will result in reductions of the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties and an equivalent charge to earnings.26 The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We compete for capital, acquisitions of reserves, undeveloped lands, skilled personnel, access to drilling rigs, service rigs and other equipment, access to processing facilities, pipeline capacity and in many other respects with a substantial number of other organizations, most of which have greater technical and financial resources than we do. Some of these organizations explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas, carry on refining operations and market oil and other products on a worldwide basis. As a result of these complementary activities, some of our competitors may have competitive resources that are greater and more diverse than ours. Furthermore, many of our competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production, such as changing prices and production levels, the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations. If our competitors are able to capitalize on these competitive resources, it could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. An increase in operating costs greater than anticipated could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Higher operating costs for our properties will directly decrease the amount of cash flow received by us. Electricity, supplies, and labor costs are a few of the operating costs that are susceptible to material fluctuation. The need for significant repairs and maintenance of infrastructure may increase as our properties age. A significant increase in operating costs could negatively impact operating results and cash flow.Our operating results are affected by our ability to market the oil and natural gas that we produce. Our business depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of oil and natural gas gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities. Canadian federal and provincial, as well as United States federal and state, regulation of oil and natural gas production, processing and transportation, tax and energy policies, general economic conditions, and changes in supply and demand could adversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas. If market factors change and inhibit the marketing of our production, overall production or realized prices may decline. We are not the operator and have limited influence over the operations of certain of our oil and natural gas properties. We hold minority interests in certain of our oil and natural gas properties. As a result, we cannot control the pace of exploration or development, major decisions affecting the drilling of wells, the plan for development and production at non-operated properties, or the timing and amount of costs related to abandonment and reclamation activities although contract provisions give Barnwell certain consent rights in some matters. The operator’s influence over these matters can affect the pace at which we incur capital expenditures. Additionally, as certain underlying joint venture data is not accessible to us, we depend on the operators at non-operated properties to provide us with reliable accounting information. We also depend on operators and joint operators to maintain the financial resources to fund their share of all abandonment and reclamation costs. 27Actual reserves will vary from reserve estimates. Estimating reserves is inherently uncertain and the reserves estimation process involves significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The reserve data and standardized measures set forth herein are only estimates. Ultimately, actual reserves attributable to our properties will vary from estimates, and those variations may be material. The estimation of reserves involves a number of factors and assumptions, including, among others: •oil and natural gas prices as prescribed by SEC regulations;•historical production from our wells compared with production rates from similar producing wells in the area;•future commodity prices, production and development costs, royalties and capital expenditures;•initial production rates;•production decline rates;•ultimate recovery of reserves;•success of future development activities;•marketability of production;•effects of government regulation; and•other government levies that may be imposed over the producing life of reserves. If these factors, assumptions and prices prove to be inaccurate, actual results may vary materially from reserve estimates. SEC rules could limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves (“PUDs”) in the future.     SEC rules require that, subject to limited exceptions, PUDs may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of booking. This requirement may limit our ability to book PUDs as we pursue our drilling program. Part of our strategy involves using some of the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques. The results of our drilling are subject to drilling and completion technique risks, and results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production.     Many of our operations involve, and are planned to utilize, the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by our service providers in order to maximize production and ultimate recoveries and therefore generate the highest possible returns. Risks we face while completing our wells include, but are not limited to, the inability to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages, the inability to run tools and other equipment the entire length of the well bore during completion operations, the inability to recover such tools and other equipment, and the inability to successfully clean out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation. Ultimately, the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period. If our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations, limited access to gathering systems and takeaway capacity, and/or prices for crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids decline, then the return on our investment for a particular project may not be as attractive as we anticipated and we could incur material write-downs of oil and gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future.28    Production and reserves, if any, attributable to the use of enhanced recovery methods are inherently difficult to predict. If our enhanced recovery methods do not allow for the extraction of crude oil, natural gas, and associated liquids in a manner or to the extent that we anticipate, we may not realize an acceptable return on our investments in such projects.Delays in business operations could adversely affect the amount and timing of our cash inflows. In addition to the usual delays in payment by purchasers of oil and natural gas to the operators of our properties, and the delays of those operators in remitting payment to us, payments between any of these parties may also be delayed by: •restrictions imposed by lenders;•accounting delays;•delays in the sale or delivery of products;•delays in the connection of wells to a gathering system;•blowouts or other accidents;•adjustments for prior periods;•recovery by the operator of expenses incurred in the operation of the properties; and•the establishment by the operator of reserves for these expenses. Any of these delays could expose us to additional third party credit risks. The oil and natural gas market in which we operate exposes us to potential liabilities that may not be covered by insurance. Our operations are subject to all of the risks associated with the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties, including the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, and the production and transportation of oil and natural gas. These risks include encountering unexpected formations or pressures, premature declines of reservoirs, blow-outs, equipment failures and other accidents, cratering, sour gas releases, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, adverse weather conditions, pollution, other environmental risks, fires and spills. A number of these risks could result in personal injury, loss of life, or environmental and other damage to our property or the property of others. While we carry various levels of insurance, we could be affected by civil, criminal, regulatory or administrative actions, claims or proceedings. We cannot fully protect against all of the risks listed above, nor are all of these risks insurable. There is no assurance that any applicable insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability for the risks listed above. We could face substantial losses if an event occurs for which we are not fully insured or are not indemnified against or a customer or insurer fails to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations. In addition, there can be no assurance that insurance will continue to be available to cover any or all of these risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive. Deficiencies in operating practices and record keeping, if any, may increase our risks and liabilities relating to incidents such as spills and releases and may increase the level of regulatory enforcement actions. 29Our operations are subject to domestic and foreign government regulation and other risks, particularly in Canada and the United States. Barnwell’s oil and natural gas operations are affected by political developments and laws and regulations, particularly in Canada and the United States, such as restrictions on production, restrictions on imports and exports, the maintenance of specified reserves, tax increases and retroactive tax claims, expropriation of property, cancellation of contract rights, environmental protection controls, environmental compliance requirements and laws pertaining to workers’ health and safety. Further, the right to explore for and develop oil and natural gas on lands in Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia is controlled by the governments of each of those provinces. Changes in royalties and other terms of provincial leases, permits and reservations may have a substantial effect on Barnwell’s operations. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from our operations in Canada; 57% in fiscal 2021. Additionally, our ability to compete in the Canadian oil and natural gas industry may be adversely affected by governmental regulations or other policies that favor the awarding of contracts to contractors in which Canadian nationals have substantial ownership interests. Furthermore, we may face governmentally imposed restrictions or fees from time to time on the transfer of funds to the U.S. Government regulations control and often limit access to potential markets and impose extensive requirements concerning employee safety, environmental protection, pollution control and remediation of environmental contamination. Environmental regulations, in particular, prohibit access to some markets and make others less economical, increase equipment and personnel costs and often impose liability without regard to negligence or fault. In addition, governmental regulations may discourage our customers’ activities, reducing demand for our products and services. Compliance with foreign tax and other laws may adversely affect our operations.Tax and other laws and regulations are not always interpreted consistently among local, regional and national authorities. Income tax laws, other legislation or government incentive programs relating to the oil and natural gas industry may in the future be changed or interpreted in a manner that adversely affects us and our stockholders. It is also possible that in the future we will be subject to disputes concerning taxation and other matters in Canada, including the manner in which we calculate our income for tax purposes, and these disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.Unforeseen title defects may result in a loss of entitlement to production and reserves. Although we conduct title reviews in accordance with industry practice prior to any purchase of resource assets or property, such reviews do not guarantee that an unforeseen defect in the chain of title will not arise and defeat our title to the purchased assets. If such a defect were to occur, our entitlement to the production from such purchased assets could be jeopardized. 30Risks Related to Land Investment Segment Receipt of future payments from KD I and KD II and cash distributions from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships is dependent upon the developer’s continued efforts and ability to develop and market the property. We are entitled to receive future payments based on a percentage of the sales prices of residential lots sold within the Kaupulehu area by KD I and KD II as well as a percentage of future distributions KD II makes to its members. However, in order to collect such payments we are reliant upon the developer, KD I and KD II, in which we own a non-controlling ownership interest, to continue to market the remaining lots within Increment I and to proceed with the development or sale of the remaining portion of Increment II. Additionally, future cash distributions from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships, which includes KD I and KD II, are also dependent on future lot sales in Increment I by KD I and the development or sale of Increment II by KD II. It is uncertain when or if KD II will develop or sell the remaining portion of Increment II, and there is no assurance with regards to the amounts of future sales from Increments I and II. We do not have a controlling interest in the partnerships, and therefore are dependent on the general partner for development decisions. The receipt of future payments and cash distributions could be jeopardized if the developer fails to proceed with development and marketing of the property. We hold investment interests in unconsolidated land development partnerships, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, in which we do not have a controlling interest. These investments involve risks and are highly illiquid. These investments involve risks which include: •the lack of a controlling interest in these partnerships and, therefore, the inability to require that the entities sell assets, return invested capital or take any other action without obtaining the majority vote of partners;•potential for future additional capital contributions to fund operations and development activities;•the adverse impact on overall profitability if the entities do not achieve the financial results projected;•the reallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives and/or an increase in indebtedness to pay potential future additional capital contributions, which could in turn restrict our ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of our business strategy;•undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems, unanticipated costs, and an inability to recover or manage such liabilities and costs and which could delay or prevent development of the real estate held by the land development partnerships; and•certain underlying partnership data is not accessible to us, therefore we depend on the general partner to provide us with reliable accounting information.31We may be required to write-down the carrying value of our investment in the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships if our assumptions about future lot sales and profitability prove incorrect. Any write-down would negatively impact our results of operations. In analyzing the value of our investment in the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships, we have made assumptions about the level of future lot sales, operating and development costs, cash generation and market conditions. These assumptions are based on management’s and the general partner’s best estimates and if the actual results differ significantly from these assumptions, we may not be able to realize the value of the assets recorded, which could lead to an impairment of certain of these assets in the future. Such a write-down would have a negative impact on our results of operations. Our land investment business is concentrated in the state of Hawaii. As a result, our financial results are dependent on the economic growth and health of Hawaii, particularly the island of Hawaii. Barnwell’s land investment segment is impacted by the condition of Hawaii’s real estate market, which is affected by Hawaii’s economy and Hawaii’s tourism industry, as well as the United States and world economies in general. Any future cash flows from Barnwell’s land development activities are subject to, among other factors, the level of real estate activity and prices, the demand for new housing and second homes on the island of Hawaii, the rate of increase in the cost of building materials and labor, the introduction of building code modifications, changes to zoning laws, and the level of confidence in Hawaii’s economy. The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business.The occurrence of a natural disaster in Hawaii such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse effect on our land investments. The occurrence of a natural disaster could also cause property and flood insurance rates and deductibles to increase, which could reduce demand for real estate in Hawaii. Risks Related to Contract Drilling Segment Demand for water well drilling and/or pump installation is volatile. A decrease in demand for our services could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. Demand for services is highly dependent upon land development activities in the state of Hawaii. As also noted above, the real estate development industry is cyclical in nature and is particularly vulnerable to shifts in local, regional, and national economic conditions outside of our control such as interest rates, housing demand, population growth, employment levels and job growth and property taxes. A decrease in water well drilling and/or pump installation contracts will result in decreased revenues and operating results.If we are unable to accurately estimate the overall risks, requirements or costs when bidding on or negotiating a contract that is ultimately awarded, we may achieve a lower than anticipated profit or incur a loss on the contract.Contracts are usually fixed price per lineal foot drilled and require the provision of line-item materials at a fixed unit price based on approved quantities irrespective of actual per unit costs. Under such contracts, prices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates, which are based on a number of assumptions, many of which are beyond our control. Expected profits on contracts are realized 32only if costs are accurately estimated and successfully controlled. We may not be able to obtain compensation for additional work performed or expenses incurred as a result of changes or inaccuracies in these estimates and underlying assumptions, such as unanticipated sub-surface site conditions, unanticipated technical problems, equipment failures, inefficiencies, cost of raw materials, schedule delays due to constraints on drilling hours, weather delays, or accidents. If cost estimates for a contract are inaccurate, or if the contract is not performed within cost estimates, then cost overruns may result in losses or cause the contract not to be as profitable as expected.A significant portion of our contract drilling business is dependent on municipalities and a decline in municipal spending could adversely impact our business. A significant portion of our contract drilling division revenues is derived from water and infrastructure contracts with governmental entities or agencies; 48% in fiscal 2021. Reduced tax revenues and governmental budgets may limit spending by local governments which in turn will affect the demand for our services. Material reductions in spending by a significant number of local governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial position. Our contract drilling operations face significant competition. We face competition for our services from a variety of competitors. Many of our competitors utilize drilling rigs that drill as quickly as our equipment but require less labor. Our strategy is to compete based on pricing and to a lesser degree, quality of service. If we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors, our financial results could be adversely affected.The loss of or damage to key vendor, customer or sub-contractor relationships would adversely affect our operations. Our contract drilling business is dependent on our relationships with key vendors, customers and subcontractors. The loss of or damage to any of our key relationships could negatively affect our business. Awarding of contracts is dependent upon our ability to obtain contract bid and performance bonds from insurers. There can be no assurance that our ability to obtain such bonds will continue on the same basis as the past. Additionally, bonding insurance rates may increase and have an impact on our ability to win competitive bids, which could have a corresponding material impact on contract drilling operating results. The contracts in our backlog are subject to change orders and cancellation. Our backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under contracts that have been started and new contracts not yet started. Our contracts are subject to change orders and cancellations, and such changes could adversely affect our operations. The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business. The occurrence of a natural disaster in Hawaii such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete our contracts.33"
12,BRN,BARNWELL INDUSTRIES,2020-12-16,"ITEM 1A.                         RISK FACTORS The business of Barnwell and its subsidiaries face numerous risks, including those set forth below or those described elsewhere in this Form 10-K or in Barnwell’s other filings with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only risks that Barnwell faces. If any of the following risk factors should occur, our profitability, financial condition or liquidity could be materially negatively impacted. Entity-Wide RisksThe Company faces issues that could impair our ability to continue as a going concern in the future.Our ability to sustain our business in the future will depend on sufficient oil and natural gas operating cash flows, which are highly sensitive to volatile oil and natural gas prices, sufficient contract drilling operating cash flows, which are subject to potentially large changes in demand, and sufficient future land investment segment proceeds and distributions from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships, the timing of which are both highly uncertain and not within Barnwell’s control. A sufficient level of such cash inflows are necessary to fund discretionary oil and natural gas capital expenditures, which must be economically successful to provide sufficient returns, as well as fund our non-discretionary outflows such as oil and natural gas asset retirement obligations and ongoing operating and general and administrative expenses.We have experienced a trend of losses and negative operating cash flows in three of the last four years. Due to the additional impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we now face a greater uncertainty about our cash inflows as described above, which in turn leads to substantial doubt regarding our ability to make the required discretionary cash outflows for the capital expenditures necessary to convert our proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves. Furthermore, because of the greater uncertainty about our cash inflows described above, there is substantial doubt about our ability to fund our non-discretionary cash outflows and thus substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date of the filing of this report.Prior to and during fiscal 2020 and subsequently, the Company investigated potential sources of funding, including non-core oil and natural gas property sales, however, no probable sources of such funding have yet been secured. Additionally, the Company has listed its corporate office on the 29th floor of a commercial office building in downtown Honolulu, Hawaii, for sale to generate liquidity in order to help mitigate the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. However, the Company’s ability to sell its corporate office at an appropriate time or for a sufficient price is outside of the Company’s control and is therefore not probable. Because of this uncertainty as well as uncertainties regarding the potential duration and depth of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business as described above, substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date of the filing of this report exists.Our business operations and financial condition have been and may continue to be materially and adversely affected by the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, which resulted in the global health pandemic referred to as COVID-19.An outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, which causes the disease referred to as COVID-19, emerged in Wuhan, China in late 2019. The novel coronavirus is considered highly contagious and has spread to most countries around the world and throughout the United States, creating a serious impact on customers, workforces and suppliers, disrupting economies and financial markets and leading to a world- 20wide economic downturn. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic and the United States and Canadian governments declared the virus a national emergency shortly thereafter. As a result, the normal operations of many businesses have been disrupted, including the temporary closure or scale-back of business operations and/or the imposition of either quarantine or remote work or meeting requirements for employees, either by government order or on a voluntary basis. The Company is currently following the recommendations of local and federal health authorities to minimize exposure risk for its various stakeholders, including employees.The global economy, our markets and our business have been materially and adversely affected by COVID-19. In the first calendar quarter of 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak caused significant reductions in demand for oil and oil prices, which made the Company's development of its proven undeveloped reserves uneconomical and negatively impacted the Company’s financial condition and outlook. As the COVID-19 pandemic continued throughout fiscal 2020 and is continuing, oil prices have continued to make the development of proven undeveloped reserves uneconomical and have severely reduced if not eliminated the Company's ability to finance such development, therefore, the Company has suspended such development. While the Company’s contract drilling segment remained operational throughout fiscal 2020 and continues to work, the continuing impact of COVID-19 on the ability or desire for customers to continue such work is uncertain, and any discontinuation of contracts currently in backlog would result in a material adverse impact to the Company’s financial condition and outlook. Both the health and economic aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic remain highly fluid and the future course of each is uncertain. We cannot foresee whether the outbreak of COVID-19 will be effectively contained on a sustained basis, nor can we predict the severity and duration of its impact. If the outbreak of COVID-19 is not effectively and timely controlled, our business operations and financial condition may continue to be materially and adversely affected as a result of the deteriorating market outlook, the global economic recession, weakened liquidity or factors that we cannot foresee. Any of these factors and other factors beyond our control could have an adverse effect on the overall business environment, cause uncertainties in the regions where we conduct business, cause our business to suffer in ways that we cannot predict and materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to the Continued Listing Criteria of the NYSE American and our failure to maintain continued compliance with the listing requirements of the NYSE American exchange could result in the delisting of our common stock.Our common stock is listed on the NYSE American. The rules of NYSE American provide that, among other things, the Company must meet certain continued listing standards relating to stockholders’ equity as set forth in Part 10, Section 1003(a) of the NYSE American Company Guide (the “Guide”) and that shares be delisted from trading, if, among other things, the Company has failed to comply with such listing agreements. For example, the NYSE American may consider suspending trading in, or removing the listing of, securities of an issuer that is not in compliance with: (i) Section 1003(a)(i) of the Guide, which requires an issuer to have stockholders’ equity of $6.0 million or more if such issuer reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in its five most recent fiscal years, (ii) Section 1003(a)(ii) of the Guide, which requires an issuer to have stockholders’ equity of $4.0 million or more if such issuer reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in three of its four most recent fiscal years, and (iii) Section 1003(a)(iii) of the Guide, which requires an issuer to have stockholders’ equity of $2.0 million or more if such issuer reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in two of its three most recent fiscal years. Even if an issuer fails to meet the foregoing stockholders’ equity requirements, the NYSE American will not normally consider delisting securities of such issuer if the issuer has (1) average global market capitalization of at least $50,000,000; or total assets and revenue of $50,000,000 in its last fiscal year, or in two of its last three fiscal years; and (2) the issuer has at least 211,100,000 shares publicly held, a market value of publicly held shares of at least $15,000,000 and 400 round lot shareholders. With respect to an issuer that is not in compliance with the foregoing requirements, upon notifying the issuer of such deficiency, the NYSE American generally provides an 18-month “cure period” for the issuer to regain the minimum stockholders’ equity requirement, however if the issuer is unable to do so, the NYSE American may delist its stock.  As of September 30, 2019, the Company had stockholders’ equity of approximately $1.2 million, as set forth in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, which was filed with the SEC on December 20, 2019, and the Company’s total value of market capitalization was approximately $4,304,000. On January 13, 2020, the Company received a letter from the NYSE American staff (the “Exchange Staff”) indicating that the Company was not in compliance with Part 10, Sections 1003(a)(i) and (a)(ii) of the Guide since it reported stockholders’ equity of $1.2 million and net losses in fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2016. The Company’s failure to meet the NYSE American’s stockholders’ equity requirements and the exceptions resulted in a risk that our common stock may be delisted. In accordance with the NYSE American’s policies and procedures, the Company submitted a plan (the “Plan”) addressing how the Company intended to regain compliance with Part 10, Section 1003 of the Guide. On April 2, 2020, the NYSE American notified the Company that it accepted the Company’s Plan and granted the Company an extension for its continued listing until July 13, 2021 (the “Plan Period”). The Company has been and will continue to be subject to periodic review by Exchange Staff during the Plan Period. The Plan was submitted to the NYSE American before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic-related low commodity price environment, the oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia and other macroeconomic pressures that have impacted our businesses and the U.S. economy in general. The magnitude and duration of these factors have and will adversely affect the Company’s ability to achieve the Plan’s goals and to return to compliance with the NYSE American’s listing standards. If the Company does not regain compliance by the end of the Plan Period, or if the Company does not make ongoing progress consistent with its Plan, the NYSE American may initiate delisting procedures as appropriate.The Company’s reported stockholders’ equity fell from $2,049,000 at March 31, 2020 to a stockholders’ deficit of $1,512,000 at June 30, 2020, and then to a stockholders’ deficit of $2,045,000 at September 30, 2020, as disclosed in the accompanying consolidated financial statements of this report. Thus, the Company may fail to be in compliance with the NYSE American continued listing standards relating to stockholders’ equity to which the Plan relates; specifically Section 1003(a)(i) and Section 1003(a)(ii). The Company submitted updates to the Plan, as required or requested by the NYSE American, in July 2020, August 2020 and September 2020. The September 2020 Plan updates presented initiatives which, if all of them are achieved, could result in the amount of stockholders’ equity required by the NYSE American at the end of the Plan Period and accordingly result in the Company regaining compliance with the NYSE American’s continued listing standards. There is no assurance that the presented initiatives will in fact be achieved. The Company has not yet received any correspondence from the NYSE American regarding the September 2020 Plan updates. If the NYSE American delists our common stock, investors may face material adverse consequences, including, but not limited to, a lack of a trading market for our common stock, reduced liquidity, and an inability for us to obtain financing to fund our operations.Stockholders may be diluted significantly through our efforts to obtain financing and satisfy obligations through the issuance of securities.Our Board of Directors has authority, without action or vote of the stockholders, subject to the 22requirements of the NYSE American (which generally require stockholder approval for any transactions which would result in the issuance of more than 20% of our then outstanding shares of common stock or voting rights representing over 20% of our then outstanding shares of stock, subject to certain exceptions, including sales in public offerings and/or sales which are undertaken at or above the greater of the book value and/or market value of the issuer’s common stock on the date the transaction is agreed to be completed), to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued shares of common stock, preferred stock or warrants to purchase such shares of common stock. In addition, we may attempt to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock, possibly at a discount to market in the future. These actions would result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing stockholders and may further dilute common stock book value, and that dilution may be material. A related effect of such issuances may enhance existing large stockholders’ influence on the Company, including that of Alexander Kinzler, our Chief Executive Officer.A small number of stockholders, including our CEO, own a significant amount of our common stock and have influence over our business regardless of the opposition of other stockholders. As of September 30, 2020, the CEO, who is a member of the Board of Directors, and two others hold approximately 36% of our outstanding common stock. The interests of one or more of these stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders. These stockholders have significant influence over all matters submitted to our stockholders, including the election of our directors, and could accelerate, delay, deter or prevent a change of control of the Company. The significant stockholders who are also members of the Board of Directors could significantly affect our business, policies and affairs.Our operations are subject to currency rate fluctuations. Our operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar. Our financial statements, presented in U.S. dollars, may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk. Volatility in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations, particularly through the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar which may affect the relative prices at which we sell our oil and natural gas and may affect the cost of certain items required in our operations. To date, we have not entered into foreign currency hedging transactions to control or minimize these risks.Adverse changes in actuarial assumptions used to calculate retirement plan costs due to economic or other factors, or lower returns on plan assets could adversely affect Barnwell’s results and financial condition. Retirement plan cash funding obligations and plan expenses and obligations are subject to a high degree of uncertainty and could increase in future years depending on numerous factors, including the performance of the financial markets, specifically the equity markets, levels of interest rates, and the cost of health care insurance premiums.The price of our common stock has been volatile and could continue to fluctuate substantially. The market price of our common stock has been volatile and could fluctuate based on a variety of factors, including: •fluctuations in commodity prices;23•variations in results of operations;•announcements by us and our competitors;•legislative or regulatory changes;•general trends in the industry;•general market conditions; •litigation; and•other events applicable to our industries.  Failure to retain key personnel could hurt our operations. We require highly skilled and experienced personnel to operate our business. In addition to competing in highly competitive industries, we compete in a highly competitive labor market. Our business could be adversely affected by an inability to retain personnel or upward pressure on wages as a result of the highly competitive labor market. Further, there are significant personal liability risks to Barnwell of Canada's individual officers and directors related to well clean-up costs that may affect our ability to attract or retain the necessary people.We are a smaller reporting company and benefit from certain reduced governance and disclosure requirements, including that our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We cannot be certain if the omission of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.Currently, we are a “smaller reporting company,” meaning that our outstanding common stock held by nonaffiliates had a value of less than $250 million at the end of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, meaning our auditors are not required to attest to the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. As a result, investors and others may be less comfortable with the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls and the risk that material weaknesses or other deficiencies in internal controls go undetected may increase. In addition, as a smaller reporting company, we take advantage of our ability to provide certain other less comprehensive disclosures in our SEC filings, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements in annual reports and simplified executive compensation disclosures.  Consequently, it may be more challenging for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects, as the information we provide to stockholders may be different from what one might receive from other public companies in which one hold shares. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide this information.Risks Related to Oil and Natural Gas Segment Acquisitions or discoveries of additional reserves are needed to increase our oil and natural gas segment operating results and cash flow. In August 2018, Barnwell made a significant reinvestment into its oil and natural gas segment with the acquisition of the Twining property in Alberta, Canada. The Company believes there are potential undeveloped reserves for which significant future capital expenditures will be needed to convert those potential undeveloped reserves into developed reserves. However, the ability to develop reserves will be heavily influenced by available financial resources. The Company has been unable to raise sufficient funds and does not currently have a definitive plan to develop such reserves and therefore has excluded 24undeveloped reserves from this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If future circumstances are such that we are not able to make the capital expenditures necessary to convert potential undeveloped reserves to developed reserves, we will not replace the amount of reserves produced and sold and our reserves and oil and natural gas segment operating results and cash flows will decline accordingly, and we may be forced to sell some of our oil and natural gas segment assets under untimely or unfavorable terms. Any such curtailment or sale could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Future oil and natural gas operating results and cash flow are highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves on an economic basis. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in developing or acquiring additional reserves and our current financial resources may be insufficient to make such investments. Furthermore, if oil or natural gas prices increase, our cost for additional reserves could also increase.  We may not realize an adequate return on oil and natural gas investments. Drilling for oil and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs. The wells we drill or participate in may not be productive, and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in those wells. If future oil and natural gas segment acquisition and development activities are not successful it could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. Oil and natural gas prices are highly volatile and further declines, or extended low prices will significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.  Much of our revenues and cash flow are greatly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas. Lower oil and natural gas prices not only decrease our revenues on a per unit basis, but also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce economically, if any. Prices that do not produce sufficient operating margins will have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, operating cash flows, borrowing ability, reserves, and the amount of capital that we are able to allocate for the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas reserves.Various factors beyond our control affect prices of oil and natural gas including, but not limited to, changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty, weather, worldwide political instability, foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the level of consumer product demand, government regulations and taxes, the price and availability of alternative fuels and the overall economic environment. Energy prices are also subject to other political and regulatory actions outside our control, which may include changes in the policies of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries or other developments involving or affecting oil-producing countries, or actions or reactions of the government of the United States in anticipation of or in response to such developments.The inability of one or more of our working interest partners to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results.For our operated properties, we pay expenses and bill our non-operating partners for their respective shares of costs. Some of our non-operating partners may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial obligations. Nonperformance by a non-operating partner could result in significant financial losses.25Liquidity problems encountered by our working interest partners or the third party operators of our non-operated properties may also result in significant financial losses as the other working interest partners or third party operators may be unwilling or unable to pay their share of the costs of projects as they become due. In the event a third party operator of a non-operated property becomes insolvent, it may result in increased operating expenses and cash required for abandonment liabilities if the Company is required to take over operatorship. Barnwell holds an 11% working interest, the largest working interest other than that held by the operator, in a property with approximately 78 wells and 6 facilities where the operator is in receivership.We may incur material costs to comply with or as a result of health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations. The oil and natural gas industry is subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to local, provincial and federal legislation. A violation of that legislation may result in the imposition of fines or the issuance of “clean up” orders. Legislation regulating the oil and natural gas industry may be changed to impose higher standards and potentially more costly obligations. Although we have recorded a provision in our financial statements relating to our estimated future environmental and reclamation obligations that we believe is reasonable, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to satisfy our actual future environmental and reclamation obligations. Barnwell's oil and natural gas segment is subject to the provisions of the AER LLR program. Under the LLR program the AER calculates a LMR for a company based on the ratio of the company’s deemed assets over its deemed liabilities relating to wells and facilities for which the company is the licensed operator and imposes a security deposit on operators whose estimated liabilities exceed their deemed asset value. At September 30, 2020, the Company had sufficient deemed asset value that no security deposit was due. However, decreases in prices and production and related netbacks from relevant properties could result in a decline in the Company's deemed asset value to a point where a deposit could be due in the future. The current liability framework is under revision by the AER. A percentage-based retirement framework is expected to be introduced, but further details are unknown at this time. The AER requires purchasers of AER licensed oil and natural gas assets to have an LMR of 2.0 or higher immediately following the transfer of a license. This LMR requirement for well transfers hinders our ability to generate capital by selling oil and natural gas assets as there are less qualified buyers. A requirement to provide security deposit funds to the AER in the future would result in the diversion of cash on hand and operating cash flows that could otherwise be used to fund oil and natural gas reserve replacement efforts, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If Barnwell fails to comply with the requirements of the LLR program, Barnwell's oil and natural gas subsidiary would be subject to the AER's enforcement provisions which could include suspension of operations and non-compliance fees and could ultimately result in the AER serving the Company with a closure order to shut-in all operated wells. Additionally, if Barnwell is non-compliant, the Company would be prohibited from transferring well licenses which would prohibit us from selling any oil and natural gas assets until the required cash deposit is made with the AER.  We are not fully insured against certain environmental risks, either because such insurance is not available or because of high premium costs. In particular, insurance against risks from environmental pollution occurring over time, as opposed to sudden and catastrophic damages, is not available on economically reasonable terms. Accordingly, any site reclamation or abandonment costs actually incurred in the ordinary course of business in a specific period could negatively impact our cash flow. Should we 26be unable to fully fund the cost of remedying an environmental problem, we might be required to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy. We may fail to fully identify potential problems related to acquired reserves or to properly estimate those reserves. We periodically evaluate acquisitions of reserves, properties, prospects and leaseholds and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategy. Our evaluation includes an assessment of reserves, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, potential for future drilling and production, validity of the seller’s title to the properties and potential environmental issues, litigation and other liabilities. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities or title defects in excess of the amounts claimed by us before closing and acquire properties on an “as is” basis. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and future production rates and costs with respect to acquired properties, and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates.If oil and natural gas prices decline, we may be required to take write-downs of the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties. Oil and natural gas prices affect the value of our oil and natural gas properties as determined in our full cost ceiling calculation. Any future ceiling test write-downs will result in reductions of the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties and an equivalent charge to earnings. The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We compete for capital, acquisitions of reserves, undeveloped lands, skilled personnel, access to drilling rigs, service rigs and other equipment, access to processing facilities, pipeline capacity and in many other respects with a substantial number of other organizations, most of which have greater technical and financial resources than we do. Some of these organizations explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas, carry on refining operations and market oil and other products on a worldwide basis. As a result of these complementary activities, some of our competitors may have competitive resources that are greater and more diverse than ours. Furthermore, many of our competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production, such as changing prices and production levels, the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations. If our competitors are able to capitalize on these competitive resources, it could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. 27An increase in operating costs greater than anticipated could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Higher operating costs for our properties will directly decrease the amount of cash flow received by us. Electricity, supplies, and labor costs are a few of the operating costs that are susceptible to material fluctuation. The need for significant repairs and maintenance of infrastructure may increase as our properties age. A significant increase in operating costs could negatively impact operating results and cash flow.Our operating results are affected by our ability to market the oil and natural gas that we produce. Our business depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of oil and natural gas gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities. Canadian federal and provincial, as well as United States federal and state, regulation of oil and natural gas production, processing and transportation, tax and energy policies, general economic conditions, and changes in supply and demand could adversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas. If market factors change and inhibit the marketing of our production, overall production or realized prices may decline. We are not the operator and have limited influence over the operations of certain of our oil and natural gas properties. We hold minority interests in certain of our oil and natural gas properties. As a result, we cannot control the pace of exploration or development, major decisions affecting the drilling of wells, the plan for development and production at non-operated properties, or the timing and amount of costs related to abandonment and reclamation activities although contract provisions give Barnwell certain consent rights in some matters. The operator’s influence over these matters can affect the pace at which we incur capital expenditures. Additionally, as certain underlying joint venture data is not accessible to us, we depend on the operators at non-operated properties to provide us with reliable accounting information. We also depend on operators and joint operators to maintain the financial resources to fund their share of all abandonment and reclamation costs. Actual reserves will vary from reserve estimates. Estimating reserves is inherently uncertain and the reserves estimation process involves significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The reserve data and standardized measures set forth herein are only estimates. Ultimately, actual reserves attributable to our properties will vary from estimates, and those variations may be material. The estimation of reserves involves a number of factors and assumptions, including, among others: •oil and natural gas prices as prescribed by SEC regulations;•historical production from our wells compared with production rates from similar producing wells in the area;•future commodity prices, production and development costs, royalties and capital expenditures;•initial production rates;•production decline rates;•ultimate recovery of reserves;•success of future development activities;•marketability of production;28•effects of government regulation; and•other government levies that may be imposed over the producing life of reserves. If these factors, assumptions and prices prove to be inaccurate, actual results may vary materially from reserve estimates. SEC rules could limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves (“PUDs”) in the future.     SEC rules require that, subject to limited exceptions, PUDs may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of booking. This requirement may limit our ability to book additional PUDs as we pursue our drilling program. Moreover, we may be required to write down our PUDs if we do not drill or plan on delaying those wells within the required five-year timeframe.Part of our strategy involves using some of the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques. The results of our drilling are subject to drilling and completion technique risks, and results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production.     Many of our operations involve, and are planned to utilize, the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by our service providers in order to maximize production and ultimate recoveries and therefore generate the highest possible returns. Risks we face while completing our wells include, but are not limited to, the inability to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages, the inability to run tools and other equipment the entire length of the well bore during completion operations, the inability to recover such tools and other equipment, and the inability to successfully clean out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation. Ultimately, the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period. If our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations, limited access to gathering systems and takeaway capacity, and/or prices for crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids decline, then the return on our investment for a particular project may not be as attractive as we anticipated and we could incur material write-downs of oil and gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future.    Production and reserves, if any, attributable to the use of enhanced recovery methods are inherently difficult to predict. If our enhanced recovery methods do not allow for the extraction of crude oil, natural gas, and associated liquids in a manner or to the extent that we anticipate, we may not realize an acceptable return on our investments in such projects.Delays in business operations could adversely affect the amount and timing of our cash inflows. In addition to the usual delays in payment by purchasers of oil and natural gas to the operators of our properties, and the delays of those operators in remitting payment to us, payments between any of these parties may also be delayed by: •restrictions imposed by lenders;•accounting delays;•delays in the sale or delivery of products;•delays in the connection of wells to a gathering system;•blowouts or other accidents;29•adjustments for prior periods;•recovery by the operator of expenses incurred in the operation of the properties; and•the establishment by the operator of reserves for these expenses. Any of these delays could expose us to additional third party credit risks. The oil and natural gas market in which we operate exposes us to potential liabilities that may not be covered by insurance. Our operations are subject to all of the risks associated with the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties, including the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, and the production and transportation of oil and natural gas. These risks include encountering unexpected formations or pressures, premature declines of reservoirs, blow-outs, equipment failures and other accidents, cratering, sour gas releases, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, adverse weather conditions, pollution, other environmental risks, fires and spills. A number of these risks could result in personal injury, loss of life, or environmental and other damage to our property or the property of others. While we carry various levels of insurance, we could be affected by civil, criminal, regulatory or administrative actions, claims or proceedings. We cannot fully protect against all of the risks listed above, nor are all of these risks insurable. There is no assurance that any applicable insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability for the risks listed above. We could face substantial losses if an event occurs for which we are not fully insured or are not indemnified against or a customer or insurer fails to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations. In addition, there can be no assurance that insurance will continue to be available to cover any or all of these risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive. Deficiencies in operating practices and record keeping, if any, may increase our risks and liabilities relating to incidents such as spills and releases and may increase the level of regulatory enforcement actions. Our operations are subject to domestic and foreign government regulation and other risks, particularly in Canada and the United States. Barnwell’s oil and natural gas operations are affected by political developments and laws and regulations, particularly in Canada and the United States, such as restrictions on production, restrictions on imports and exports, the maintenance of specified reserves, tax increases and retroactive tax claims, expropriation of property, cancellation of contract rights, environmental protection controls, environmental compliance requirements and laws pertaining to workers’ health and safety. Further, the right to explore for and develop oil and natural gas on lands in Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia is controlled by the governments of each of those provinces. Changes in royalties and other terms of provincial leases, permits and reservations may have a substantial effect on Barnwell’s operations. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from our operations in Canada; 38% in fiscal 2020. Additionally, our ability to compete in the Canadian oil and natural gas industry may be adversely affected by governmental regulations or other policies that favor the awarding of contracts to contractors in which Canadian nationals have substantial ownership interests. Furthermore, we may face governmentally imposed restrictions or fees from time to time on the transfer of funds to the U.S.30 Government regulations control and often limit access to potential markets and impose extensive requirements concerning employee safety, environmental protection, pollution control and remediation of environmental contamination. Environmental regulations, in particular, prohibit access to some markets and make others less economical, increase equipment and personnel costs and often impose liability without regard to negligence or fault. In addition, governmental regulations may discourage our customers’ activities, reducing demand for our products and services. Compliance with foreign tax and other laws may adversely affect our operations.Tax and other laws and regulations are not always interpreted consistently among local, regional and national authorities. Income tax laws, other legislation or government incentive programs relating to the oil and natural gas industry may in the future be changed or interpreted in a manner that adversely affects us and our stockholders. It is also possible that in the future we will be subject to disputes concerning taxation and other matters in Canada, including the manner in which we calculate our income for tax purposes, and these disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.Unforeseen title defects may result in a loss of entitlement to production and reserves. Although we conduct title reviews in accordance with industry practice prior to any purchase of resource assets or property, such reviews do not guarantee that an unforeseen defect in the chain of title will not arise and defeat our title to the purchased assets. If such a defect were to occur, our entitlement to the production from such purchased assets could be jeopardized. Risks Related to Land Investment Segment Receipt of future payments from KD I and KD II and cash distributions from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships is dependent upon the developer’s continued efforts and ability to develop and market the property. We are entitled to receive future payments based on a percentage of the sales prices of residential lots sold within the Kaupulehu area by KD I and KD II as well as a percentage of future distributions KD II makes to its members. However, in order to collect such payments we are reliant upon the developer, KD I and KD II, in which we own a non-controlling ownership interest, to continue to market the remaining lots within Increment I and to proceed with the development or sale of the remaining portion of Increment II. Additionally, future cash distributions from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships, which includes KD I and KD II, are also dependent on future lot sales in Increment I by KD I and the development or sale of Increment II by KD II. It is uncertain when or if KD II will develop or sell the remaining portion of Increment II, and there is no assurance with regards to the amounts of future sales from Increments I and II. We do not have a controlling interest in the partnerships, and therefore are dependent on the general partner for development decisions. The receipt of future payments and cash distributions could be jeopardized if the developer fails to proceed with development and marketing of the property. 31We hold investment interests in unconsolidated land development partnerships, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, in which we do not have a controlling interest. These investments involve risks and are highly illiquid. These investments involve risks which include: •the lack of a controlling interest in these partnerships and, therefore, the inability to require that the entities sell assets, return invested capital or take any other action without obtaining the majority vote of partners;•potential for future additional capital contributions to fund operations and development activities;•the adverse impact on overall profitability if the entities do not achieve the financial results projected;•the reallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives and/or an increase in indebtedness to pay potential future additional capital contributions, which could in turn restrict our ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of our business strategy;•undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems, unanticipated costs, and an inability to recover or manage such liabilities and costs; and•certain underlying partnership data is not accessible to us, therefore we depend on the general partner to provide us with reliable accounting information.We may be required to write-down the carrying value of our investment in the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships if our assumptions about future lot sales and profitability prove incorrect. Any write-down would negatively impact our results of operations. In analyzing the value of our investment in the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships, we have made assumptions about the level of future lot sales, operating and development costs, cash generation and market conditions. These assumptions are based on management’s and the general partner’s best estimates and if the actual results differ significantly from these assumptions, we may not be able to realize the value of the assets recorded, which could lead to an impairment of certain of these assets in the future. Such a write-down would have a negative impact on our results of operations. Our land investment business is concentrated in the state of Hawaii. As a result, our financial results are dependent on the economic growth and health of Hawaii, particularly the island of Hawaii. Barnwell’s land investment segment is impacted by the condition of Hawaii’s real estate market, which is affected by Hawaii’s economy and Hawaii’s tourism industry, as well as the United States and world economies in general. Any future cash flows from Barnwell’s land development activities are subject to, among other factors, the level of real estate activity and prices, the demand for new housing and second homes on the island of Hawaii, the rate of increase in the cost of building materials and labor, the introduction of building code modifications, changes to zoning laws, and the level of confidence in Hawaii’s economy. The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business.The occurrence of a natural disaster in Hawaii such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse 32effect on our land investments. The occurrence of a natural disaster could also cause property and flood insurance rates and deductibles to increase, which could reduce demand for real estate in Hawaii. Risks Related to Contract Drilling Segment Demand for water well drilling and/or pump installation is volatile. A decrease in demand for our services could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. Demand for services is highly dependent upon land development activities in the state of Hawaii. As also noted above, the real estate development industry is cyclical in nature and is particularly vulnerable to shifts in local, regional, and national economic conditions outside of our control such as interest rates, housing demand, population growth, employment levels and job growth and property taxes. A decrease in water well drilling and/or pump installation contracts will result in decreased revenues and operating results.If we are unable to accurately estimate the overall risks, requirements or costs when bidding on or negotiating a contract that is ultimately awarded, we may achieve a lower than anticipated profit or incur a loss on the contract.Contracts are usually fixed price per lineal foot drilled and require the provision of line-item materials at a fixed unit price based on approved quantities irrespective of actual per unit costs. Under such contracts, prices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates, which are based on a number of assumptions, many of which are beyond our control. Expected profits on contracts are realized only if costs are accurately estimated and successfully controlled. We may not be able to obtain compensation for additional work performed or expenses incurred as a result of changes or inaccuracies in these estimates and underlying assumptions, such as unanticipated sub-surface site conditions, unanticipated technical problems, equipment failures, inefficiencies, cost of raw materials, schedule delays due to constraints on drilling hours, weather delays, or accidents. If cost estimates for a contract are inaccurate, or if the contract is not performed within cost estimates, then cost overruns may result in losses or cause the contract not to be as profitable as expected.A significant portion of our contract drilling business is dependent on municipalities and a decline in municipal spending could adversely impact our business. A significant portion of our contract drilling division revenues is derived from water and infrastructure contracts with governmental entities or agencies; 9% in fiscal 2020. Reduced tax revenues and governmental budgets may limit spending by local governments which in turn will affect the demand for our services. Material reductions in spending by a significant number of local governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial position. Our contract drilling operations face significant competition. We face competition for our services from a variety of competitors. Many of our competitors utilize drilling rigs that drill as quickly as our equipment but require less labor. Our strategy is to compete based on pricing and to a lesser degree, quality of service. If we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors, our financial results could be adversely affected.33The loss of or damage to key vendor, customer or sub-contractor relationships would adversely affect our operations. Our contract drilling business is dependent on our relationships with key vendors, customers and subcontractors. The loss of or damage to any of our key relationships could negatively affect our business. Awarding of contracts is dependent upon our ability to obtain contract bid and performance bonds from insurers. There can be no assurance that our ability to obtain such bonds will continue on the same basis as the past. Additionally, bonding insurance rates may increase and have an impact on our ability to win competitive bids, which could have a corresponding material impact on contract drilling operating results. The contracts in our backlog are subject to change orders and cancellation. Our backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under contracts that have been started and new contracts not yet started. Our contracts are subject to change orders and cancellations, and such changes could adversely affect our operations. The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business. The occurrence of a natural disaster in Hawaii such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete our contracts"
3,BRN,BARNWELL INDUSTRIES,2019-12-23,"ITEM 1A.                         RISK FACTORS The business of Barnwell and its subsidiaries face numerous risks, including those set forth below or those described elsewhere in this Form 10-K or in Barnwell’s other filings with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only risks that Barnwell faces. If any of the following risk factors should occur, our profitability, financial condition or liquidity could be materially negatively impacted. Entity-Wide RisksThe Company faces issues that could impair our ability to continue as a going concern in the future.Our ability to sustain our business in the future will depend on sufficient oil and natural gas operating cash flows, which are highly sensitive to potentially volatile oil and natural gas prices, sufficient contract drilling operating cash flows, which are subject to potentially large changes in demand, sufficient future land investment segment proceeds and distributions from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships, the timing of which are both highly uncertain and not within Barnwell’s control, and our ability to fund our needed oil and natural gas capital expenditures and the level of success of such capital expenditures, as well as our ability to fund oil and natural gas asset retirement obligations and ongoing operating and general and administrative expenses.  The Twining oil and natural gas reserves consist of proved producing reserves as well as a significant amount of proved reserves that are undeveloped.  Our proved undeveloped reserves are estimated to require roughly $13,000,000 in future oil and natural gas capital expenditures to develop within the next five years. It is possible that we will need to obtain a significant amount of new financing in the form of debt or equity in order to develop the reserves to the level estimated by our independent reserve engineers.      Management believes our current cash balances and estimated future operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund the Company's estimated cash outflows for the next 12 months from the date of this report. The estimated future operating cash flows are based on management's probable estimates and assumes oil and natural gas prices do not decline and contract drilling jobs do not encounter unforeseen difficulties and are completed without unforeseen delays or stoppages. The estimated future operating cash flows are also based on  management's estimates of operating cash flows from the drilling of oil and natural gas wells to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved producing reserves, as well as the cash outflows required for the drilling of such wells. If actual results are less than management's estimates and if we are then unable to obtain financing or if the financing is not obtained in sufficient time or is not of sufficient magnitude to sustain our business, or if unforeseen circumstances arise that impair our ability to sustain our business, the Company will need to consider further sales of our assets or alternative strategies, or we may be forced to wind down our operations, either through liquidation or bankruptcy, and we may not be able to continue as a going concern beyond December 2020.Stockholders may be diluted significantly through our efforts to obtain financing and satisfy obligations through the issuance of securities. Our Board of Directors has authority, without action or vote of the stockholders, subject to the requirements of the NYSE American (which generally require stockholder approval for any transactions which would result in the issuance of more than 20% of our then outstanding shares of common stock or voting rights representing over 20% of our then outstanding shares of stock, subject to certain exceptions, including sales in public offerings and/or sales which are undertaken at or above the greater of the book value and/or market value of the issuer’s common stock on the date the transaction is agreed to be completed), to 18issue all or part of the authorized but unissued shares of common stock, preferred stock or warrants to purchase such shares of common stock. In addition, we may attempt to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock, possibly at a discount to market in the future. These actions would result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing stockholders and may further dilute common stock book value, and that dilution may be material. Such issuances also may serve to enhance existing management’s ability to maintain control of us, because the shares may be issued to parties or entities committed to supporting existing management. We are subject to the Continued Listing Criteria of the NYSE American and our failure to satisfy these criteria may result in delisting of our common stock. Our common stock is currently listed on the NYSE American. In order to maintain this listing, we must maintain certain share prices, financial and share distribution targets, including maintaining a minimum amount of stockholders’ equity and a minimum number of public stockholders. In addition to these objective standards, the NYSE American may delist the securities of any issuer if, in its opinion, the issuer’s financial condition and/or operating results appear unsatisfactory; if it appears that the extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of the security has become so reduced as to make continued listing on the NYSE American inadvisable; if the issuer sells or disposes of principal operating assets or ceases to be an operating company; if an issuer fails to comply with the NYSE American’s listing requirements; if an issuer’s common stock sells at what the NYSE American considers a “low selling price” (generally trading below $0.20 per share for an extended period of time); or if any other event occurs or any condition exists which makes continued listing on the NYSE American, in its opinion, inadvisable.  If the NYSE American delists our common stock, investors may face material adverse consequences, including, but not limited to, a lack of trading market for our securities, reduced liquidity, and an inability for us to obtain additional financing to fund our operations.   Due to the fact that our common stock is listed on the NYSE American, we are subject to financial and other reporting and corporate governance requirements which increase our costs and expenses. We are currently required to file annual and quarterly information and other reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission that are specified in Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Additionally, due to the fact that our common stock is listed on the NYSE American, we are also subject to the requirements to maintain independent directors, comply with other corporate governance requirements and are required to pay annual listing and stock issuance fees. These obligations require a commitment of additional resources including, but not limited, to additional expenses, and may result in the diversion of our senior management’s time and attention from our day-to-day operations. These obligations increase our expenses and may make it more complicated or time consuming for us to undertake certain corporate actions due to the fact that we may require NYSE approval for such transactions and/or NYSE rules may require us to obtain stockholder approval for such transactions.A small number of stockholders, including our CEO, own a significant amount of our common stock and have influence over our business regardless of the opposition of other stockholders. As of September 30, 2019, the CEO, who is a member of the Board of Directors, and two others hold approximately 36% of our outstanding common stock. The interests of one or more of these stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders. These stockholders have significant influence over all matters submitted to our stockholders, including the election of our directors, and could accelerate, delay, deter or prevent a change of control of the Company. The significant stockholders who are also members of the Board of Directors could significantly affect our business, policies and affairs.19Our operations are subject to currency rate fluctuations. Our operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar. Our financial statements, presented in U.S. dollars, may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk. Volatility in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations, particularly through the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar which may affect the relative prices at which we sell our oil and natural gas and may affect the cost of certain items required in our operations. To date, we have not entered into foreign currency hedging transactions to control or minimize these risks.Adverse changes in actuarial assumptions used to calculate retirement plan costs due to economic or other factors, or lower returns on plan assets could adversely affect Barnwell’s results and financial condition. Retirement plan cash funding obligations and plan expenses and obligations are subject to a high degree of uncertainty and could increase in future years depending on numerous factors, including the performance of the financial markets, specifically the equity markets, levels of interest rates, and the cost of health care insurance premiums.The price of our common stock has been volatile and could continue to fluctuate substantially. The market price of our common stock has been volatile and could fluctuate based on a variety of factors, including: •fluctuations in commodity prices;•variations in results of operations;•announcements by us and our competitors;•legislative or regulatory changes;•general trends in the industry;•general market conditions; •litigation; and•other events applicable to our industries.  Failure to retain key personnel could hurt our operations. We require highly skilled and experienced personnel to operate our business. In addition to competing in highly competitive industries, we compete in a highly competitive labor market. Our business could be adversely affected by an inability to retain personnel or upward pressure on wages as a result of the highly competitive labor market. Further, there are significant personal liability risks to Barnwell of Canada's individual officers and directors related to well clean-up costs that may affect our ability to attract or retain the necessary people.20We are a smaller reporting company and benefit from certain reduced governance and disclosure requirements, including that our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We cannot be certain if the omission of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.Currently, we are a “smaller reporting company,” meaning that our outstanding common stock held by nonaffiliates had a value of less than $250 million at the end of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, meaning our auditors are not required to attest to the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. As a result, investors and others may be less comfortable with the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls and the risk that material weaknesses or other deficiencies in internal controls go undetected may increase. In addition, as a smaller reporting company, we take advantage of our ability to provide certain other less comprehensive disclosures in our SEC filings, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements in annual reports and simplified executive compensation disclosures.  Consequently, it may be more challenging for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects, as the information we provide to stockholders may be different from what one might receive from other public companies in which one hold shares. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide this information.Risks Related to Oil and Natural Gas Segment Acquisitions or discoveries of additional reserves are needed to increase our oil and natural gas segment operating results and cash flow.  Since fiscal 2014, Barnwell has been selectively divesting oil and natural assets to improve operational focus, reduce abandonment liabilities, and decrease the Company's debt burden, however, as a result of these sales, our oil and natural gas segment revenues and operating cash flow have significantly declined. Most notably, in September 2015, we sold our interest in our principal oil and natural gas property Dunvegan, which resulted in a 60% decrease in our proved natural gas reserves and a 34% decrease in our proved oil and natural gas liquids reserves. In fiscal 2015, Dunvegan contributed 46% of our total oil and natural gas revenues. In February 2018, we sold our interest in our oil and natural gas property Red Earth. Red Earth represented 0.07% of our proved natural gas reserves and 25% of our proved oil and natural gas liquids reserves as of September 30, 2017, and 22% of our total oil and natural gas revenues in the year ended September 30, 2017. In August 2018, Barnwell made a significant reinvestment into its oil and natural gas segment with the acquisition of the Twining property in Alberta, Canada which resulted in a significant increase in our proved reserves. However, a significant portion of those proved reserves include proved undeveloped reserves for which it is estimated that $13,000,000 in future capital expenditures will need to be made to convert those undeveloped reserves into developed reserves.  The ability to convert the undeveloped reserves to developed reserves will be heavily influenced by the cash flows generated by the oil and natural gas segment, the results of such drilling, and the need for and sufficiency of any potential future capital financing. If future circumstances are such that we are not able to make the capital expenditures necessary to convert the undeveloped reserves to developed reserves, our future reserves and resulting operating results and cash flows from our reserves will be less than our expectations and less than the estimations included in this report. Also, continued reinvestment in oil and natural gas segment assets are needed to replace the significant amount of reserves produced and sold.21Future oil and natural gas operating results and cash flow are highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves on an economic basis. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in developing or acquiring additional reserves and our current financial resources may be insufficient to make such investments. Furthermore, if oil or natural gas prices increase, our cost for additional reserves could also increase. We may have difficulty funding oil and natural gas segment capital expenditures which could have an adverse effect on our business. Conversion of our proved undeveloped reserves into proved developed reserves will require substantial capital expenditures which we intend to fund using cash on hand and operational cash generated, if any. However, the Company's current cash on hand and future cash earnings is likely to be needed to fund upcoming cash needs including asset retirement obligations, retirement plan funding, and ongoing operating and general and administrative expenses, such that some or potentially all of the cash will not be available for reinvestment. Future cash flows from operations are uncertain and are based on a number of variables including the level of production from existing wells, oil and natural gas prices, and our success in acquiring and developing new reserves. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets, in particular with respect to companies in the energy sector, could limit our ability to access these markets or may significantly increase our cost to borrow. Decreases in commodity prices in recent years, among other factors, are causing and may continue to cause lenders to increase interest rates, enact tighter lending standards which we may not be able to satisfy, and reduce or cease to provide funding to borrowers. If additional capital is required, we may not be able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us, or at all. If cash on hand and cash generated by operations, if any, is not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could limit our ability to fund capital expenditures, and we may need to curtail the development of our proved undeveloped reserves or be forced to sell some of our oil and natural gas segment assets under untimely or unfavorable terms. Any such curtailment or sale could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not realize an adequate return on oil and natural gas investments. Drilling for oil and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs. The wells we drill or participate in may not be productive, and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in those wells. If future oil and natural gas segment acquisition and development activities are not successful it could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. Oil and natural gas prices are highly volatile and further declines, or extended low prices will significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.  Much of our revenues and cash flow are greatly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas. Lower oil and natural gas prices not only decrease our revenues on a per unit basis, but also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce economically, if any. Prices that do not produce sufficient operating margins will have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, operating cash flows, borrowing ability, reserves, and the amount of capital that we are able to allocate for the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas reserves.22Various factors beyond our control affect prices of oil and natural gas including, but not limited to, changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty, weather, worldwide political instability, foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the level of consumer product demand, government regulations and taxes, the price and availability of alternative fuels and the overall economic environment. Energy prices are also subject to other political and regulatory actions outside our control, which may include changes in the policies of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries or other developments involving or affecting oil-producing countries, or actions or reactions of the government of the United States in anticipation of or in response to such developments.The inability of one or more of our working interest partners to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results.For our operated properties, we pay expenses and bill our non-operating partners for their respective shares of costs. Some of our non-operating partners may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial obligations. Nonperformance by a non-operating partner could result in significant financial losses.Liquidity problems encountered by our working interest partners or the third party operators of our non-operated properties may also result in significant financial losses as the other working interest partners or third party operators may be unwilling or unable to pay their share of the costs of projects as they become due. In the event a third party operator of a non-operated property becomes insolvent, it may result in increased operating expenses and cash required for abandonment liabilities if the Company is required to take over operatorship. Barnwell holds a 10% working interest, the largest working interest other than that held by the operator, in a property with approximately 80 wells where the operator is in receivership.We may incur material costs to comply with or as a result of health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations. The oil and natural gas industry is subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to local, provincial and federal legislation. A violation of that legislation may result in the imposition of fines or the issuance of “clean up” orders. Legislation regulating the oil and natural gas industry may be changed to impose higher standards and potentially more costly obligations. Although we have recorded a provision in our financial statements relating to our estimated future environmental and reclamation obligations that we believe is reasonable, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to satisfy our actual future environmental and reclamation obligations. Barnwell's oil and natural gas segment is subject to the provisions of the Alberta Energy Regulator's (“AER”) Licensee Liability Rating (“LLR”) program. Under the LLR program the AER calculates a Liability Management Ratio (“LMR”) for a company based on the ratio of the company’s deemed assets over its deemed liabilities relating to wells and facilities for which the company is the licensed operator and imposes a security deposit on operators whose estimated liabilities exceed their deemed asset value. At September 30, 2019, the Company had sufficient deemed asset value that no security deposit was due. However, decreases in prices and production and related netbacks from relevant properties could result in a decline in the Company's deemed asset value to a point where a deposit could be due in the future.The AER requires purchasers of AER licensed oil and natural gas assets to have an LMR of 2.0 or higher immediately following the transfer of a license. This LMR requirement for well transfers hinders our ability to generate capital by selling oil and natural gas assets as there are less qualified buyers. 23A requirement to provide security deposit funds to the AER in the future would result in the diversion of cash on hand and operating cash flows that could otherwise be used to fund oil and natural gas reserve replacement efforts, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If Barnwell fails to comply with the requirements of the LLR program, Barnwell's oil and natural gas subsidiary would be subject to the AER's enforcement provisions which could include suspension of operations and non-compliance fees and could ultimately result in the AER serving the Company with a closure order to shut-in all operated wells. Additionally, if Barnwell is non-compliant, the Company would be prohibited from transferring well licenses which would prohibit us from selling any oil and natural gas assets until the required cash deposit is made with the AER.  We are not fully insured against certain environmental risks, either because such insurance is not available or because of high premium costs. In particular, insurance against risks from environmental pollution occurring over time, as opposed to sudden and catastrophic damages, is not available on economically reasonable terms. Accordingly, any site reclamation or abandonment costs actually incurred in the ordinary course of business in a specific period could negatively impact our cash flow. Should we be unable to fully fund the cost of remedying an environmental problem, we might be required to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy. We may fail to fully identify potential problems related to acquired reserves or to properly estimate those reserves. We periodically evaluate acquisitions of reserves, properties, prospects and leaseholds and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategy. Our evaluation includes an assessment of reserves, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, potential for future drilling and production, validity of the seller’s title to the properties and potential environmental issues, litigation and other liabilities. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities or title defects in excess of the amounts claimed by us before closing and acquire properties on an “as is” basis. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and future production rates and costs with respect to acquired properties, and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates.If oil and natural gas prices decline, we may be required to take write-downs of the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties. Oil and natural gas prices affect the value of our oil and natural gas properties as determined in our full cost ceiling calculation. Any future ceiling test write-downs will result in reductions of the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties and an equivalent charge to earnings.24 The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We compete for capital, acquisitions of reserves, undeveloped lands, skilled personnel, access to drilling rigs, service rigs and other equipment, access to processing facilities, pipeline capacity and in many other respects with a substantial number of other organizations, most of which have greater technical and financial resources than we do. Some of these organizations explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas, carry on refining operations and market oil and other products on a worldwide basis. As a result of these complementary activities, some of our competitors may have competitive resources that are greater and more diverse than ours. Furthermore, many of our competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production, such as changing prices and production levels, the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations. If our competitors are able to capitalize on these competitive resources, it could adversely affect our revenues. An increase in operating costs greater than anticipated could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Higher operating costs for our properties will directly decrease the amount of cash flow received by us. Electricity, supplies, and labor costs are a few of the operating costs that are susceptible to material fluctuation. The need for significant repairs and maintenance of infrastructure may increase as our properties age. A significant increase in operating costs could negatively impact operating results and cash flow.Our operating results are affected by our ability to market the oil and natural gas that we produce. Our business depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of oil and natural gas gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities. Canadian federal and provincial, as well as United States federal and state, regulation of oil and natural gas production, processing and transportation, tax and energy policies, general economic conditions, and changes in supply and demand could adversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas. If market factors change and inhibit the marketing of our production, overall production or realized prices may decline. We are not the operator and have limited influence over the operations of certain of our oil and natural gas properties. We hold minority interests in certain of our oil and natural gas properties. As a result, we cannot control the pace of exploration or development, major decisions affecting the drilling of wells, the plan for development and production at non-operated properties, or the timing and amount of costs related to abandonment and reclamation activities although contract provisions give Barnwell certain consent rights in some matters. The operator’s influence over these matters can affect the pace at which we incur capital expenditures. Additionally, as certain underlying joint venture data is not accessible to us, we depend on the operators at non-operated properties to provide us with reliable accounting information. We also depend on operators and joint operators to maintain the financial resources to fund their share of all abandonment and reclamation costs. 25Actual reserves will vary from reserve estimates. Estimating reserves is inherently uncertain and the reserves estimation process involves significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The reserve data and standardized measures set forth herein are only estimates. Ultimately, actual reserves attributable to our properties will vary from estimates, and those variations may be material. The estimation of reserves involves a number of factors and assumptions, including, among others: •oil and natural gas prices as prescribed by SEC regulations;•historical production from our wells compared with production rates from similar producing wells in the area;•future commodity prices, production and development costs, royalties and capital expenditures;•initial production rates;•production decline rates;•ultimate recovery of reserves;•success of future development activities;•marketability of production;•effects of government regulation; and•other government levies that may be imposed over the producing life of reserves. If these factors, assumptions and prices prove to be inaccurate, actual results may vary materially from reserve estimates. SEC rules could limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves (“PUDs”) in the future. SEC rules require that, subject to limited exceptions, PUDs may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of booking. This requirement may limit our ability to book additional PUDs as we pursue our drilling program. Moreover, we may be required to write down our PUDs if we do not drill or plan on delaying those wells within the required five-year timeframe.Part of our strategy involves using some of the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques. The results of our drilling are subject to drilling and completion technique risks, and results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production. Many of our operations involve, and are planned to utilize, the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by our service providers in order to maximize production and ultimate recoveries and therefore generate the highest possible returns. Risks we face while completing our wells include, but are not limited to, the inability to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages, the inability to run tools and other equipment the entire length of the well bore during completion operations, the inability to recover such tools and other equipment, and the inability to successfully clean out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation. Ultimately, the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period. If our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations, limited access to gathering systems and takeaway capacity, and/or prices for crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids decline, then the return on our investment for a particular project may not be as attractive as we anticipated and we could incur material write-downs of oil and gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future.26Production and reserves, if any, attributable to the use of enhanced recovery methods are inherently difficult to predict. If our enhanced recovery methods do not allow for the extraction of crude oil, natural gas, and associated liquids in a manner or to the extent that we anticipate, we may not realize an acceptable return on our investments in such projects.Delays in business operations could adversely affect the amount and timing of our cash inflows. In addition to the usual delays in payment by purchasers of oil and natural gas to the operators of our properties, and the delays of those operators in remitting payment to us, payments between any of these parties may also be delayed by: •restrictions imposed by lenders;•accounting delays;•delays in the sale or delivery of products;•delays in the connection of wells to a gathering system;•blowouts or other accidents;•adjustments for prior periods;•recovery by the operator of expenses incurred in the operation of the properties; and•the establishment by the operator of reserves for these expenses. Any of these delays could expose us to additional third party credit risks. The oil and natural gas market in which we operate exposes us to potential liabilities that may not be covered by insurance. Our operations are subject to all of the risks associated with the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties, including the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, and the production and transportation of oil and natural gas. These risks include encountering unexpected formations or pressures, premature declines of reservoirs, blow-outs, equipment failures and other accidents, cratering, sour gas releases, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, adverse weather conditions, pollution, other environmental risks, fires and spills. A number of these risks could result in personal injury, loss of life, or environmental and other damage to our property or the property of others. While we carry various levels of insurance, we could be affected by civil, criminal, regulatory or administrative actions, claims or proceedings. We cannot fully protect against all of the risks listed above, nor are all of these risks insurable. There is no assurance that any applicable insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability for the risks listed above. We could face substantial losses if an event occurs for which we are not fully insured or are not indemnified against or a customer or insurer fails to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations. In addition, there can be no assurance that insurance will continue to be available to cover any or all of these risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive. Deficiencies in operating practices and record keeping, if any, may increase our risks and liabilities relating to incidents such as spills and releases and may increase the level of regulatory enforcement actions. 27Our operations are subject to domestic and foreign government regulation and other risks, particularly in Canada and the United States. Barnwell’s oil and natural gas operations are affected by political developments and laws and regulations, particularly in Canada and the United States, such as restrictions on production, restrictions on imports and exports, the maintenance of specified reserves, tax increases and retroactive tax claims, expropriation of property, cancellation of contract rights, environmental protection controls, environmental compliance requirements and laws pertaining to workers’ health and safety. Further, the right to explore for and develop oil and natural gas on lands in Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia is controlled by the governments of each of those provinces. Changes in royalties and other terms of provincial leases, permits and reservations may have a substantial effect on Barnwell’s operations. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from our operations in Canada; 54% in fiscal 2019. Additionally, our ability to compete in the Canadian oil and natural gas industry may be adversely affected by governmental regulations or other policies that favor the awarding of contracts to contractors in which Canadian nationals have substantial ownership interests. Furthermore, we may face governmentally imposed restrictions or fees from time to time on the transfer of funds to the U.S. Government regulations control and often limit access to potential markets and impose extensive requirements concerning employee safety, environmental protection, pollution control and remediation of environmental contamination. Environmental regulations, in particular, prohibit access to some markets and make others less economical, increase equipment and personnel costs and often impose liability without regard to negligence or fault. In addition, governmental regulations may discourage our customers’ activities, reducing demand for our products and services. Compliance with foreign tax and other laws may adversely affect our operations.Tax and other laws and regulations are not always interpreted consistently among local, regional and national authorities. Income tax laws, other legislation or government incentive programs relating to the oil and natural gas industry may in the future be changed or interpreted in a manner that adversely affects us and our stockholders. It is also possible that in the future we will be subject to disputes concerning taxation and other matters in Canada, including the manner in which we calculate our income for tax purposes, and these disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.Unforeseen title defects may result in a loss of entitlement to production and reserves. Although we conduct title reviews in accordance with industry practice prior to any purchase of resource assets or property, such reviews do not guarantee that an unforeseen defect in the chain of title will not arise and defeat our title to the purchased assets. If such a defect were to occur, our entitlement to the production from such purchased assets could be jeopardized. Risks Related to Land Investment Segment Receipt of future payments from KD I and KD II and cash distributions from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships is dependent upon the developer’s continued efforts and ability to develop and market the property. We are entitled to receive future payments based on a percentage of the sales prices of residential lots sold within the Kaupulehu area by KD I and KD II as well as a percentage of future distributions KD II 28makes to its members. However, in order to collect such payments we are reliant upon the developer, KD I and KD II, in which we own a non-controlling ownership interest, to continue to market the remaining lots within Increment I and to proceed with the development or sale of the remaining portion of Increment II. Additionally, future cash distributions from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships, which includes KD I and KD II, are also dependent on future lot sales in Increment I by KD I and the development or sale of Increment II by KD II. It is uncertain when or if KD II will develop or sell the remaining portion of Increment II, and there is no assurance with regards to the amounts of future sales from Increments I and II. We do not have a controlling interest in the partnerships, and therefore are dependent on the general partner for development decisions. The receipt of future payments and cash distributions could be jeopardized if the developer fails to proceed with development and marketing of the property. We hold investment interests in unconsolidated land development partnerships, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, in which we do not have a controlling interest. These investments involve risks and are highly illiquid. These investments involve risks which include: •the lack of a controlling interest in these partnerships and, therefore, the inability to require that the entities sell assets, return invested capital or take any other action without obtaining the majority vote of partners;•potential for future additional capital contributions to fund operations and development activities;•the adverse impact on overall profitability if the entities do not achieve the financial results projected;•the reallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives and/or an increase in indebtedness to pay potential future additional capital contributions, which could in turn restrict our ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of our business strategy;•undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems, unanticipated costs, and an inability to recover or manage such liabilities and costs; and•certain underlying partnership data is not accessible to us, therefore we depend on the general partner to provide us with reliable accounting information.We may be required to write-down the carrying value of our investment in the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships if our assumptions about future lot sales and profitability prove incorrect. Any write-down would negatively impact our results of operations. In analyzing the value of our investment in the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships, we have made assumptions about the level of future lot sales, operating and development costs, cash generation and market conditions. These assumptions are based on management’s and the general partner’s best estimates and if the actual results differ significantly from these assumptions, we may not be able to realize the value of the assets recorded, which could lead to an impairment of certain of these assets in the future. Such a write-down would have a negative impact on our results of operations. Our land investment business is concentrated in the state of Hawaii. As a result, our financial results are dependent on the economic growth and health of Hawaii, particularly the island of Hawaii. Barnwell’s land investment segment is impacted by the condition of Hawaii’s real estate market, which is affected by Hawaii’s economy and Hawaii’s tourism industry, as well as the United States and world economies in general. Any future cash flows from Barnwell’s land development activities are subject to, 29among other factors, the level of real estate activity and prices, the demand for new housing and second homes on the island of Hawaii, the rate of increase in the cost of building materials and labor, the introduction of building code modifications, changes to zoning laws, and the level of confidence in Hawaii’s economy. The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business.The occurrence of a natural disaster in Hawaii such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse effect on our land investments. The occurrence of a natural disaster could also cause property and flood insurance rates and deductibles to increase, which could reduce demand for real estate in Hawaii. Risks Related to Contract Drilling Segment Demand for water well drilling and/or pump installation is volatile. A decrease in demand for our services could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. Demand for services is highly dependent upon land development activities in the state of Hawaii. As also noted above, the real estate development industry is cyclical in nature and is particularly vulnerable to shifts in local, regional, and national economic conditions outside of our control such as interest rates, housing demand, population growth, employment levels and job growth and property taxes. A decrease in water well drilling and/or pump installation contracts will result in decreased revenues and operating results.If we are unable to accurately estimate the overall risks, requirements or costs when bidding on or negotiating a contract that is ultimately awarded, we may achieve a lower than anticipated profit or incur a loss on the contract.Contracts are usually fixed price per lineal foot drilled and require the provision of line-item materials at a fixed unit price based on approved quantities irrespective of actual per unit costs. Under such contracts, prices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates, which are based on a number of assumptions, many of which are beyond our control. Expected profits on contracts are realized only if costs are accurately estimated and successfully controlled. We may not be able to obtain compensation for additional work performed or expenses incurred as a result of changes or inaccuracies in these estimates and underlying assumptions, such as unanticipated sub-surface site conditions, unanticipated technical problems, equipment failures, inefficiencies, cost of raw materials, schedule delays due to constraints on drilling hours, weather delays, or accidents. If cost estimates for a contract are inaccurate, or if the contract is not performed within cost estimates, then cost overruns may result in losses or cause the contract not to be as profitable as expected.A significant portion of our contract drilling business is dependent on municipalities and a decline in municipal spending could adversely impact our business. A significant portion of our contract drilling division revenues is derived from water and infrastructure contracts with governmental entities or agencies; 26% in fiscal 2019. Reduced tax revenues and governmental budgets may limit spending by local governments which in turn will affect the demand for our services. Material reductions in spending by a significant number of local governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial position. 30Our contract drilling operations face significant competition. We face competition for our services from a variety of competitors. Many of our competitors utilize drilling rigs that drill as quickly as our equipment but require less labor. Our strategy is to compete based on pricing and to a lesser degree, quality of service. If we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors, our financial results could be adversely affected.The loss of or damage to key vendor, customer or sub-contractor relationships would adversely affect our operations. Our contract drilling business is dependent on our relationships with key vendors, customers and subcontractors. The loss of or damage to any of our key relationships could negatively affect our business. Awarding of contracts is dependent upon our ability to obtain contract bid and performance bonds from insurers. There can be no assurance that our ability to obtain such bonds will continue on the same basis as the past. Additionally, bonding insurance rates may increase and have an impact on our ability to win competitive bids, which could have a corresponding material impact on contract drilling operating results. The contracts in our backlog are subject to change orders and cancellation. Our backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under contracts that have been started and new contracts not yet started. Our contracts are subject to change orders and cancellations, and such changes could adversely affect our operations. The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business. The occurrence of a natural disaster in Hawaii such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete our contracts"
4,BRN,BARNWELL INDUSTRIES,2018-12-20,"ITEM 1A.                         RISK FACTORS The business of Barnwell and its subsidiaries face numerous risks, including those set forth below or those described elsewhere in this Form 10-K or in Barnwell’s other filings with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only risks that Barnwell faces. If any of the following risk factors should occur, our profitability, financial condition or liquidity could be materially negatively impacted. Entity-Wide RisksThe Company faces issues that could impair our ability to continue as a going concern in the future.The Twining reserves acquired consist of proved producing reserves as well as a significant amount of proved reserves that are undeveloped.  Our proved undeveloped reserves are estimated to require roughly $14,000,000 in future oil and natural gas capital expenditures to develop within the next five years. Cash flows generated by developed Twining reserves are estimated by our independent reserve engineering firm to be sufficient to fund such capital expenditures. However, as the independent reserve engineering firm’s estimates do not consider items such as our ongoing general and administrative expenses, it is possible that we will need to obtain a significant amount of new financing in the form of debt or equity in order to develop the reserves to the level estimated by our independent reserve engineers.  Our ability to sustain our business in the future will depend on sufficient oil and natural gas operating cash flows, which are highly sensitive to potentially volatile oil and natural gas prices, sufficient future land investment segment proceeds and distributions from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships, the timing of which are both highly uncertain and not within Barnwell’s control, and our ability to fund our needed oil and natural gas capital expenditures and the level of success of such capital expenditures, as well as our ability to fund oil and natural gas asset retirement obligations and ongoing operating and general and administrative expenses.  Management believes our current cash balances, working capital and future cash inflows from operations will be sufficient to fund its estimated cash outflows for the next 12 months.  However, if oil and natural gas and land investment cash inflows and any needed new financing sources are not sufficient to sustain our longer term business plans, which are currently based upon assumptions and estimates that may not materialize, or if unforeseen circumstances arise that impair our ability to sustain or grow our business, the Company may need to consider further sales of our assets or alternative strategies, or we may be forced to wind down our operations, either through liquidation or bankruptcy, and we may not be able to continue as a going concern in 2020 and beyond.A small number of stockholders, including our CEO, own a significant amount of our common stock and have influence over our business regardless of the opposition of other stockholders. As of September 30, 2018, the CEO, who is a member of the Board of Directors, and two others hold approximately 36% of our outstanding common stock. The interests of one or more of these stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders. These stockholders have significant influence over all matters submitted to our stockholders, including the election of our directors, and could accelerate, delay, deter or prevent a change of control of the Company. The significant stockholders who are also members of the Board of Directors could significantly affect our business, policies and affairs.17Our operations are subject to currency rate fluctuations. Our operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar. Our financial statements, presented in U.S. dollars, may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk. Volatility in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations, particularly through the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar which may affect the relative prices at which we sell our oil and natural gas and may affect the cost of certain items required in our operations. To date, we have not entered into foreign currency hedging transactions to control or minimize these risks.Adverse changes in actuarial assumptions used to calculate retirement plan costs due to economic or other factors, or lower returns on plan assets could adversely affect Barnwell’s results and financial condition. Retirement plan cash funding obligations and plan expenses and obligations are subject to a high degree of uncertainty and could increase in future years depending on numerous factors, including the performance of the financial markets, specifically the equity markets, levels of interest rates, and the cost of health care insurance premiums.The price of our common stock has been volatile and could continue to fluctuate substantially. The market price of our common stock has been volatile and could fluctuate based on a variety of factors, including: •fluctuations in commodity prices;•variations in results of operations;•announcements by us and our competitors;•legislative or regulatory changes;•general trends in the industry;•general market conditions; •litigation; and•analysts’ estimates and other events applicable to our industries.  Failure to retain key personnel could hurt our operations. We require highly skilled and experienced personnel to operate our business. In addition to competing in highly competitive industries, we compete in a highly competitive labor market. Our business could be adversely affected by an inability to retain personnel or upward pressure on wages as a result of the highly competitive labor market. Further, there are significant personal liability risks to Barnwell of Canada's individual officers and directors related to well clean-up costs that may affect our ability to attract or retain the necessary people.18We are a smaller reporting company and benefit from certain reduced governance and disclosure requirements, including that our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We cannot be certain if the omission of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.Currently, we are a “smaller reporting company,” meaning that our outstanding common stock held by nonaffiliates had a value of less than $250 million at the end of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, meaning our auditors are not required to attest to the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. As a result, investors and others may be less comfortable with the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls and the risk that material weaknesses or other deficiencies in internal controls go undetected may increase. In addition, as a smaller reporting company, we take advantage of our ability to provide certain other less comprehensive disclosures in our SEC filings, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements in annual reports and simplified executive compensation disclosures.  Consequently, it may be more challenging for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects, as the information we provide to stockholders may be different from what one might receive from other public companies in which one hold shares. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide this information.Risks Related to Oil and Natural Gas Segment Acquisitions or discoveries of additional reserves are needed to increase our oil and natural gas segment operating results and cash flow.  Since fiscal 2014, Barnwell has been selectively divesting oil and natural assets to improve operational focus, reduce abandonment liabilities, and decrease the Company's debt burden, however, as a result of these sales, our oil and natural gas segment revenues and operating cash flow have significantly declined. Most notably, in September 2015, we sold our interest in our principal oil and natural gas property Dunvegan, which resulted in a 60% decrease in our proved natural gas reserves and a 34% decrease in our proved oil and natural gas liquids reserves. In fiscal 2015, Dunvegan contributed 46% of our total oil and natural gas revenues. In February 2018, we sold our interest in our oil and natural gas property Red Earth. Red Earth represented 0.07% of our proved natural gas reserves and 25% of our proved oil and natural gas liquids reserves as of September 30, 2017, and 22% of our total oil and natural gas revenues in the year ended September 30, 2017. In August 2018, Barnwell made a significant reinvestment into its oil and natural gas segment with the acquisition of the Twining property in Alberta, Canada which resulted in a significant increase in our proved reserves. However, a significant portion of those proved reserves include proved undeveloped reserves for which it is estimated that $14,000,000 in future capital expenditures will need to be made to convert those undeveloped reserves into developed reserves.  The ability to convert the undeveloped reserves to developed reserves will be heavily influenced by the cash flows generated by the oil and natural gas segment, the results of such drilling, and the need for and sufficiency of any potential future capital financing. If future circumstances are such that we are not able to make the capital expenditures necessary to convert the undeveloped reserves to developed reserves, our future reserves and resulting operating results and cash flows from our reserves will be less than our expectations and less than the estimations included in this report. Also, continued reinvestment in oil and natural gas segment assets are needed to replace the significant amount of reserves produced and sold.19Future oil and natural gas operating results and cash flow are highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves on an economic basis. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in developing or acquiring additional reserves and our current financial resources may be insufficient to make such investments. Furthermore, if oil or natural gas prices increase, our cost for additional reserves could also increase. We may have difficulty funding oil and natural gas segment capital expenditures which could have an adverse effect on our business. Conversion of our proved undeveloped reserves into proved developed reserves will require substantial capital expenditures which we intend to fund using cash on hand and operational cash generated, if any. However, the Company's current cash on hand is likely to be needed to fund upcoming cash needs including asset retirement obligations, retirement plan funding, and ongoing operating and general and administrative expenses, such that some or potentially all of the cash will not be available for reinvestment. Future cash flows from operations are uncertain and are based on a number of variables including the level of production from existing wells, oil and natural gas prices, and our success in acquiring and developing new reserves. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets, in particular with respect to companies in the energy sector, could limit our ability to access these markets or may significantly increase our cost to borrow. Decreases in commodity prices in recent years, among other factors, are causing and may continue to cause lenders to increase interest rates, enact tighter lending standards which we may not be able to satisfy, and reduce or cease to provide funding to borrowers. If additional capital is required, we may not be able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us, or at all. If cash on hand and cash generated by operations, if any, is not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could limit our ability to fund capital expenditures, and we may need to curtail the development of our proved undeveloped reserves or be forced to sell some of our oil and natural gas segment assets under untimely or unfavorable terms. Any such curtailment or sale could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not realize an adequate return on oil and natural gas investments. Drilling for oil and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs. The wells we drill or participate in may not be productive, and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in those wells. If future oil and natural gas segment acquisition and development activities are not successful it could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. Oil and natural gas prices are highly volatile and further declines, or extended low prices will significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.  Much of our revenues and cash flow are greatly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas. Lower oil and natural gas prices not only decrease our revenues on a per unit basis, but also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce economically, if any. Prices that do not produce sufficient operating margins will have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, operating cash flows, borrowing ability, reserves, and the amount of capital that we are able to allocate for the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas reserves.20Various factors beyond our control affect prices of oil and natural gas including, but not limited to, changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty, weather, worldwide political instability, foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the level of consumer product demand, government regulations and taxes, the price and availability of alternative fuels and the overall economic environment. Energy prices are also subject to other political and regulatory actions outside our control, which may include changes in the policies of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries or other developments involving or affecting oil-producing countries, or actions or reactions of the government of the United States in anticipation of or in response to such developments.The inability of one or more of our working interest partners to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results.For our operated properties, we pay expenses and bill our non-operating partners for their respective shares of costs. Some of our non-operating partners may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial obligations. Nonperformance by a non-operating partner could result in significant financial losses.Liquidity problems encountered by our working interest partners or the third party operators of our non-operated properties may also result in significant financial losses as the other working interest partners or third party operators may be unwilling or unable to pay their share of the costs of projects as they become due. In the event a third party operator of a non-operated property becomes insolvent, it may result in increased operating expenses and cash required for abandonment liabilities if the Company is required to take over operatorship. Barnwell holds a 10% working interest, the largest working interest other than that held by the operator, in a property with approximately 80 wells where the operator is in receivership.We may incur material costs to comply with or as a result of health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations. The oil and natural gas industry is subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to local, provincial and federal legislation. A violation of that legislation may result in the imposition of fines or the issuance of “clean up” orders. Legislation regulating the oil and natural gas industry may be changed to impose higher standards and potentially more costly obligations. Although we have recorded a provision in our financial statements relating to our estimated future environmental and reclamation obligations that we believe is reasonable, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to satisfy our actual future environmental and reclamation obligations. Barnwell's oil and natural gas segment is subject to the provisions of the Alberta Energy Regulator's (“AER”) Licensee Liability Rating (“LLR”) program. Under the LLR program the AER calculates a Liability Management Ratio (“LMR”) for a company based on the ratio of the company’s deemed assets over its deemed liabilities relating to wells and facilities for which the company is the licensed operator and imposes a security deposit on operators whose estimated liabilities exceed their deemed asset value. At September 30, 2018, the Company had sufficient deemed asset value that no security deposit was due. However, decreases in prices and production and related netbacks from relevant properties could result in a decline in the Company's deemed asset value to a point where a deposit could be due in the future.The AER requires purchasers of AER licensed oil and natural gas assets to have an LMR of 2.0 or higher immediately following the transfer of a license. This LMR requirement for well transfers hinders our ability to generate capital by selling oil and natural gas assets as there are less qualified buyers. 21A requirement to provide security deposit funds to the AER in the future would result in the diversion of cash on hand and operating cash flows that could otherwise be used to fund oil and natural gas reserve replacement efforts, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If Barnwell fails to comply with the requirements of the LLR program, Barnwell's oil and natural gas subsidiary would be subject to the AER's enforcement provisions which could include suspension of operations and non-compliance fees and could ultimately result in the AER serving the Company with a closure order to shut-in all operated wells. Additionally, if Barnwell is non-compliant, the Company would be prohibited from transferring well licenses which would prohibit us from selling any oil and natural gas assets until the required cash deposit is made with the AER.  We are not fully insured against certain environmental risks, either because such insurance is not available or because of high premium costs. In particular, insurance against risks from environmental pollution occurring over time, as opposed to sudden and catastrophic damages, is not available on economically reasonable terms. Accordingly, any site reclamation or abandonment costs actually incurred in the ordinary course of business in a specific period could negatively impact our cash flow. Should we be unable to fully fund the cost of remedying an environmental problem, we might be required to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy. We may fail to fully identify potential problems related to acquired reserves or to properly estimate those reserves. We periodically evaluate acquisitions of reserves, properties, prospects and leaseholds and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategy. Our evaluation includes an assessment of reserves, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, potential for future drilling and production, validity of the seller’s title to the properties and potential environmental issues, litigation and other liabilities. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities or title defects in excess of the amounts claimed by us before closing and acquire properties on an “as is” basis. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and future production rates and costs with respect to acquired properties, and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates.If oil and natural gas prices decline, we may be required to take write-downs of the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties. Oil and natural gas prices affect the value of our oil and natural gas properties as determined in our full cost ceiling calculation. Any future ceiling test write-downs will result in reductions of the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties and an equivalent charge to earnings.22 The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We compete for capital, acquisitions of reserves, undeveloped lands, skilled personnel, access to drilling rigs, service rigs and other equipment, access to processing facilities, pipeline capacity and in many other respects with a substantial number of other organizations, most of which have greater technical and financial resources than we do. Some of these organizations explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas, carry on refining operations and market oil and other products on a worldwide basis. As a result of these complementary activities, some of our competitors may have competitive resources that are greater and more diverse than ours. Furthermore, many of our competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production, such as changing prices and production levels, the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations. If our competitors are able to capitalize on these competitive resources, it could adversely affect our revenues. An increase in operating costs greater than anticipated could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Higher operating costs for our properties will directly decrease the amount of cash flow received by us. Electricity, supplies, and labor costs are a few of the operating costs that are susceptible to material fluctuation. The need for significant repairs and maintenance of infrastructure may increase as our properties age. A significant increase in operating costs could negatively impact operating results and cash flow.Our operating results are affected by our ability to market the oil and natural gas that we produce. Our business depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of oil and natural gas gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities. Canadian federal and provincial, as well as United States federal and state, regulation of oil and natural gas production, processing and transportation, tax and energy policies, general economic conditions, and changes in supply and demand could adversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas. If market factors change and inhibit the marketing of our production, overall production or realized prices may decline. We are not the operator and have limited influence over the operations of certain of our oil and natural gas properties. We hold minority interests in certain of our oil and natural gas properties. As a result, we cannot control the pace of exploration or development, major decisions affecting the drilling of wells, the plan for development and production at non-operated properties, or the timing and amount of costs related to abandonment and reclamation activities although contract provisions give Barnwell certain consent rights in some matters. The operator’s influence over these matters can affect the pace at which we incur capital expenditures. Additionally, as certain underlying joint venture data is not accessible to us, we depend on the operators at non-operated properties to provide us with reliable accounting information. We also depend on operators and joint operators to maintain the financial resources to fund their share of all abandonment and reclamation costs. 23Actual reserves will vary from reserve estimates. Estimating reserves is inherently uncertain and the reserves estimation process involves significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The reserve data and standardized measures set forth herein are only estimates. Ultimately, actual reserves attributable to our properties will vary from estimates, and those variations may be material. The estimation of reserves involves a number of factors and assumptions, including, among others: •oil and natural gas prices as prescribed by SEC regulations;•historical production from our wells compared with production rates from similar producing wells in the area;•future commodity prices, production and development costs, royalties and capital expenditures;•initial production rates;•production decline rates;•ultimate recovery of reserves;•success of future development activities;•marketability of production;•effects of government regulation; and•other government levies that may be imposed over the producing life of reserves. If these factors, assumptions and prices prove to be inaccurate, actual results may vary materially from reserve estimates. Delays in business operations could adversely affect the amount and timing of our cash inflows. In addition to the usual delays in payment by purchasers of oil and natural gas to the operators of our properties, and the delays of those operators in remitting payment to us, payments between any of these parties may also be delayed by: •restrictions imposed by lenders;•accounting delays;•delays in the sale or delivery of products;•delays in the connection of wells to a gathering system;•blowouts or other accidents;•adjustments for prior periods;•recovery by the operator of expenses incurred in the operation of the properties; and•the establishment by the operator of reserves for these expenses. Any of these delays could expose us to additional third party credit risks. The oil and natural gas market in which we operate exposes us to potential liabilities that may not be covered by insurance. Our operations are subject to all of the risks associated with the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties, including the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, and the production and transportation of oil and natural gas. These risks include encountering unexpected formations or pressures, premature declines of reservoirs, blow-outs, equipment failures and other accidents, cratering, sour gas releases, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, adverse weather conditions, pollution, other 24environmental risks, fires and spills. A number of these risks could result in personal injury, loss of life, or environmental and other damage to our property or the property of others. While we carry various levels of insurance, we could be affected by civil, criminal, regulatory or administrative actions, claims or proceedings. We cannot fully protect against all of the risks listed above, nor are all of these risks insurable. There is no assurance that any applicable insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability for the risks listed above. We could face substantial losses if an event occurs for which we are not fully insured or are not indemnified against or a customer or insurer fails to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations. In addition, there can be no assurance that insurance will continue to be available to cover any or all of these risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive. Deficiencies in operating practices and record keeping, if any, may increase our risks and liabilities relating to incidents such as spills and releases and may increase the level of regulatory enforcement actions. Our operations are subject to domestic and foreign government regulation and other risks, particularly in Canada and the United States. Barnwell’s oil and natural gas operations are affected by political developments and laws and regulations, particularly in Canada and the United States, such as restrictions on production, restrictions on imports and exports, the maintenance of specified reserves, tax increases and retroactive tax claims, expropriation of property, cancellation of contract rights, environmental protection controls, environmental compliance requirements and laws pertaining to workers’ health and safety. Further, the right to explore for and develop oil and natural gas on lands in Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia is controlled by the governments of each of those provinces. Changes in royalties and other terms of provincial leases, permits and reservations may have a substantial effect on Barnwell’s operations. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from our operations in Canada; 41% in fiscal 2018. Additionally, our ability to compete in the Canadian oil and natural gas industry may be adversely affected by governmental regulations or other policies that favor the awarding of contracts to contractors in which Canadian nationals have substantial ownership interests. Furthermore, we may face governmentally imposed restrictions or fees from time to time on the transfer of funds to the U.S. Government regulations control and often limit access to potential markets and impose extensive requirements concerning employee safety, environmental protection, pollution control and remediation of environmental contamination. Environmental regulations, in particular, prohibit access to some markets and make others less economical, increase equipment and personnel costs and often impose liability without regard to negligence or fault. In addition, governmental regulations may discourage our customers’ activities, reducing demand for our products and services. Compliance with foreign tax and other laws may adversely affect our operations.Tax and other laws and regulations are not always interpreted consistently among local, regional and national authorities. Income tax laws, other legislation or government incentive programs relating to the oil and natural gas industry may in the future be changed or interpreted in a manner that adversely affects us and our stockholders. It is also possible that in the future we will be subject to disputes concerning taxation and other matters in Canada, including the manner in which we calculate our income for tax purposes, and these disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.25Unforeseen title defects may result in a loss of entitlement to production and reserves. Although we conduct title reviews in accordance with industry practice prior to any purchase of resource assets or property, such reviews do not guarantee that an unforeseen defect in the chain of title will not arise and defeat our title to the purchased assets. If such a defect were to occur, our entitlement to the production from such purchased assets could be jeopardized. Risks Related to Land Investment Segment Receipt of future payments from KD I and KD II and cash distributions from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships is dependent upon the developer’s continued efforts and ability to develop and market the property. We are entitled to receive future payments based on a percentage of the sales prices of residential lots sold within the Kaupulehu area by KD I and KD II as well as a percentage of future distributions KD II makes to its members. However, in order to collect such payments we are reliant upon the developer, KD I and KD II, in which we own a non-controlling ownership interest, to continue to market the remaining lots within Increment I and to proceed with the development or sale of the remaining portion of Increment II. Additionally, future cash distributions from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships, which includes KD I and KD II, are also dependent on future lot sales in Increment I by KD I and the development or sale of Increment II by KD II. It is uncertain when or if KD II will develop or sell the remaining portion of Increment II, and there is no assurance with regards to the amounts of future sales from Increments I and II. KD II is required to submit an overall status report of the project, including the percentage of completed development, by April 20, 2019. There is a possibility that regulatory authorities could impose adverse conditions of approval that impede the developer's goals, or outright refuse to extend the allowed zoning beyond April 20, 2019, which would have an adverse impact on the value of the property. Currently, a formal request for a 20-year time extension of the original development period was submitted by the general partner and reviewed by the regulatory authorities. Although the initial response has been favorable, a 20-year extension has not been granted to date. We do not have a controlling interest in the partnerships, and therefore are dependent on the general partner for development decisions. The receipt of future payments and cash distributions could be jeopardized if the developer fails to proceed with development and marketing of the property. We hold investment interests in unconsolidated land development partnerships, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, in which we do not have a controlling interest. These investments involve risks and are highly illiquid. These investments involve risks which include: •the lack of a controlling interest in these partnerships and, therefore, the inability to require that the entities sell assets, return invested capital or take any other action without obtaining the majority vote of partners;•potential for future additional capital contributions to fund operations and development activities;•the adverse impact on overall profitability if the entities do not achieve the financial results projected;•the reallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives and/or an increase in indebtedness to pay potential future additional capital contributions, which could in turn restrict 26our ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of our business strategy;•undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems, unanticipated costs, and an inability to recover or manage such liabilities and costs; and•certain underlying partnership data is not accessible to us, therefore we depend on the general partner to provide us with reliable accounting information.We may be required to write-down the carrying value of our investment in the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships if our assumptions about future lot sales and profitability prove incorrect. Any write-down would negatively impact our results of operations. In analyzing the value of our investment in the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships, we have made assumptions about the level of future lot sales, operating and development costs, cash generation and market conditions. These assumptions are based on management’s and the general partner’s best estimates and if the actual results differ significantly from these assumptions, we may not be able to realize the value of the assets recorded, which could lead to an impairment of certain of these assets in the future. Such a write-down would have a negative impact on our results of operations. Our land investment business is concentrated in the state of Hawaii. As a result, our financial results are dependent on the economic growth and health of Hawaii, particularly the island of Hawaii. Barnwell’s land investment segment is impacted by the condition of Hawaii’s real estate market, which is affected by Hawaii’s economy and Hawaii’s tourism industry, as well as the United States and world economies in general. Any future cash flows from Barnwell’s land development activities are subject to, among other factors, the level of real estate activity and prices, the demand for new housing and second homes on the island of Hawaii, the rate of increase in the cost of building materials and labor, the introduction of building code modifications, changes to zoning laws, and the level of confidence in Hawaii’s economy. The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business.The occurrence of a natural disaster in Hawaii such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse effect on our land investments. The occurrence of a natural disaster could also cause property and flood insurance rates and deductibles to increase, which could reduce demand for real estate in Hawaii. Risks Related to Contract Drilling Segment Demand for water well drilling and/or pump installation is volatile. A decrease in demand for our services could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. Demand for services is highly dependent upon land development activities in the state of Hawaii. As also noted above, the real estate development industry is cyclical in nature and is particularly vulnerable to shifts in local, regional, and national economic conditions outside of our control such as interest rates, housing demand, population growth, employment levels and job growth and property taxes. A decrease in water well drilling and/or pump installation contracts will result in decreased revenues and operating results. 27If we are unable to accurately estimate the overall risks, requirements or costs when bidding on or negotiating a contract that is ultimately awarded, we may achieve a lower than anticipated profit or incur a loss on the contract.Contracts are usually fixed price per lineal foot drilled and require the provision of line-item materials at a fixed unit price based on approved quantities irrespective of actual per unit costs. Under such contracts, prices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates, which are based on a number of assumptions, many of which are beyond our control. Expected profits on contracts are realized only if costs are accurately estimated and successfully controlled. We may not be able to obtain compensation for additional work performed or expenses incurred as a result of changes or inaccuracies in these estimates and underlying assumptions, such as unanticipated sub-surface site conditions, unanticipated technical problems, equipment failures, inefficiencies, cost of raw materials, schedule delays due to constraints on drilling hours, weather delays, or accidents. If cost estimates for a contract are inaccurate, or if the contract is not performed within cost estimates, then cost overruns may result in losses or cause the contract not to be as profitable as expected.A significant portion of our contract drilling business is dependent on municipalities and a decline in municipal spending could adversely impact our business. A significant portion of our contract drilling division revenues is derived from water and infrastructure contracts with governmental entities or agencies; 58% in fiscal 2018. Reduced tax revenues and governmental budgets may limit spending by local governments which in turn will affect the demand for our services. Material reductions in spending by a significant number of local governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial position. Our contract drilling operations face significant competition. We face competition for our services from a variety of competitors. Many of our competitors utilize drilling rigs that drill as quickly as our equipment but require less labor. Our strategy is to compete based on pricing and to a lesser degree, quality of service. If we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors, our financial results could be adversely affected.The loss of or damage to key vendor, customer or sub-contractor relationships would adversely affect our operations. Our contract drilling business is dependent on our relationships with key vendors, customers and subcontractors. The loss of or damage to any of our key relationships could negatively affect our business. Awarding of contracts is dependent upon our ability to obtain contract bid and performance bonds from insurers. There can be no assurance that our ability to obtain such bonds will continue on the same basis as the past. Additionally, bonding insurance rates may increase and have an impact on our ability to win competitive bids, which could have a corresponding material impact on contract drilling operating results. 28The contracts in our backlog are subject to change orders and cancellation. Our backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under contracts that have been started and new contracts not yet started. Our contracts are subject to change orders and cancellations, and such changes could adversely affect our operations. The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business. The occurrence of a natural disaster in Hawaii such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete our contracts"
5,BRN,BARNWELL INDUSTRIES,2017-12-21,"ITEM 1A.                         RISK FACTORS The business of Barnwell and its subsidiaries face numerous risks, including those set forth below or those described elsewhere in this Form 10-K or in Barnwell’s other filings with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only risks that Barnwell faces. If any of the following risk factors should occur, our profitability, financial condition or liquidity could be materially negatively impacted. Entity-Wide RisksThe Company faces issues that could impair our ability to continue as a going concern in the future.Due to the negative impacts of 1) declines in oil and natural gas prices (notwithstanding the recent increases in prices); 2) declines in oil and natural gas production due to both oil and natural gas property sales and the natural decline oil and natural gas wells experience as they age; 3) increasing costs due to both inflation, the age of Barnwell's properties, increases in governmental regulation and other factors, Barnwell's existing oil and natural gas assets are projected to have negative cash flow from operations. As a result, the Company's current cash on hand will likely not be sufficient to fund both the reinvestments that are necessary to sustain our business in the future and our asset retirement obligations, retirement plan funding, and ongoing operating and general and administrative expenses. Therefore, it is likely that Barnwell will be increasingly reliant upon future land investment segment proceeds, if any, and future cash distributions, if any, from the Kukio Resort land development partnerships, the timing of which are both highly uncertain and not within Barnwell’s control, to fund operations and provide capital for reinvestment. Additionally, the Company may need to consider alternative strategies to enable it to sustain or grow its business. If the Company is unable to make sufficient and successful investments in the near future, or if unforeseen circumstances arise that impair our ability to sustain or grow the Company, we will likely be forced to wind down our operations, either through liquidation, bankruptcy or further sales of our assets, and/or we may not be able to continue as a going concern beyond one year.Our revenues have decreased significantly in recent years and there can be no assurances that our revenues will not continue to decline.Our consolidated revenues have been declining rapidly for years with the most significant decline in our oil and natural gas segment primarily resulting from the sales of a significant amount of our oil and natural gas assets since fiscal 2014, most notably the sale of Dunvegan our principal oil and natural gas property which was sold in September 2015, and declines in oil and natural gas prices. We need to generate new revenues quickly and profitably, but there can be no assurances that we will be successful in doing so. Failure to increase our revenues profitability may force us to wind down our operations, either through further liquidation of our assets or bankruptcy.  We may not be able to continue as a going concern beyond one year.A small number of stockholders, including our CEO and former CEO and Chairman of the Board, own a significant amount of our common stock and have influence over our business regardless of the opposition of other stockholders. As of September 30, 2017, the CEO, the former CEO and Chairman of the Board, who are both members of the Board of Directors, and two others hold approximately 38% of our outstanding common stock. The interests of one or more of these stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders. These stockholders have significant influence over all matters submitted to our stockholders, including the election of our directors, and could accelerate, delay, deter or prevent a change of control of 17the Company. The significant stockholders who are also members of the Board of Directors could significantly affect our business, policies and affairs.Our operations are subject to currency rate fluctuations. Our operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar. Our financial statements, presented in U.S. dollars, may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk. Volatility in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations, particularly through the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar which may affect the relative prices at which we sell our oil and natural gas and may affect the cost of certain items required in our operations. To date, we have not entered into foreign currency hedging transactions to control or minimize these risks.Adverse changes in actuarial assumptions used to calculate retirement plan costs due to economic or other factors, or lower returns on plan assets could adversely affect Barnwell’s results and financial condition. Retirement plan cash funding obligations and plan expenses and obligations are subject to a high degree of uncertainty and could increase in future years depending on numerous factors, including the performance of the financial markets, specifically the equity markets, levels of interest rates, and the cost of health care insurance premiums.The price of our common stock has been volatile and could continue to fluctuate substantially. The market price of our common stock has been volatile and could fluctuate based on a variety of factors, including: •fluctuations in commodity prices;•variations in results of operations;•announcements by us and our competitors;•legislative or regulatory changes;•general trends in the industry;•general market conditions; •litigation; and•analysts’ estimates and other events applicable to our industries.  Failure to retain key personnel could hurt our operations. We require highly skilled and experienced personnel to operate our business. In addition to competing in highly competitive industries, we compete in a highly competitive labor market. Our business could be adversely affected by an inability to retain personnel or upward pressure on wages as a result of the highly competitive labor market. Further, there are significant personal liability risks to Barnwell of Canada's individual officers and directors related to well clean-up costs that may affect our ability to attract or retain the necessary people.18We are a smaller reporting company and are taking advantage of certain reduced governance and disclosure requirements, including that our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We cannot be certain if the omission of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.Currently, we are a “smaller reporting company,” meaning that our outstanding common stock held by nonaffiliates had a value of less than $75 million at the end of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, meaning our auditors are not required to attest to the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. As a result, investors and others may be less comfortable with the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls and the risk that material weaknesses or other deficiencies in internal controls go undetected may increase. In addition, as a smaller reporting company, we take advantage of our ability to provide certain other less comprehensive disclosures in our SEC filings, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements in annual reports and simplified executive compensation disclosures.  Consequently, it may be more challenging for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects, as the information we provide to stockholders may be different from what one might receive from other public companies in which one hold shares. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide this information.Risks Related to Oil and Natural Gas Segment Acquisitions or discoveries of additional reserves are needed to increase our oil and natural gas segment operating results and cash flow.  Since fiscal 2014, Barnwell has been selectively divesting oil and natural assets to improve operational focus, reduce abandonment liabilities, and decrease the Company's debt burden, however, as a result of these sales, our oil and natural gas segment revenues and operating cash flow have significantly declined. Most notably, in September 2015, we sold our interest in our principal oil and natural gas property Dunvegan, which resulted in a 60% decrease in our proved natural gas reserves and a 34% decrease in our proved oil and natural gas liquids reserves. In fiscal 2015, Dunvegan contributed 46% of our total oil and natural gas revenues. Reinvestment in oil and natural gas segment assets are needed to replace the significant amount of reserves sold and reserves produced.Future oil and natural gas operating results and cash flow are highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves on an economic basis. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in developing or acquiring additional reserves and our current financial resources may be insufficient to make such investments. Furthermore, if oil or natural gas prices increase, our cost for additional reserves could also increase. We may have difficulty funding oil and natural gas segment capital expenditures which could have an adverse effect on our business. Our oil and natural gas acquisition and development activities require substantial capital expenditures which we intend to fund using cash on hand. However, the Company's current cash on hand is likely to be needed to fund upcoming cash needs including asset retirement obligations, retirement plan funding, and ongoing operating and general and administrative expenses, such that some or potentially all of the cash will not be available for reinvestment. Future cash flows from operations are uncertain and are based on a number of variables including the level of production from existing wells, oil and natural gas prices, and our success 19in acquiring and developing new reserves. Barnwell's existing oil and natural gas assets are projected to have negative cash flow from operations at current prices and production levels.Disruptions in the capital and credit markets, in particular with respect to companies in the energy sector, could limit our ability to access these markets or may significantly increase our cost to borrow. Decreases in commodity prices in recent years, among other factors, are causing and may continue to cause lenders to increase interest rates, enact tighter lending standards which we may not satisfy, and reduce or cease to provide funding to borrowers. If additional capital is required, we may not be able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us, or at all. If cash on hand and cash generated by operations, if any, is not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could limit our ability to fund capital expenditures, and we may be forced to curtail our oil and natural gas activities or be forced to sell some of our oil and natural gas segment assets under untimely or unfavorable terms. Any such curtailment or sale could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not realize an adequate return on oil and natural gas investments. Drilling for oil and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs. The wells we drill or participate in may not be productive, and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in those wells. If future oil and natural gas segment acquisition and development activities are not successful it could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. Oil and natural gas prices are highly volatile and further declines, or extended low prices will significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.  Much of our revenues and cash flow are greatly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas. Lower oil and natural gas prices not only decrease our revenues on a per unit basis, but also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce economically, if any. Prices that do not produce sufficient operating margins will have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, operating cash flows, borrowing ability, reserves, and the amount of capital that we are able to allocate for the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas reserves.Various factors beyond our control affect prices of oil and natural gas including, but not limited to, changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty, weather, worldwide political instability, foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the level of consumer product demand, government regulations and taxes, the price and availability of alternative fuels and the overall economic environment. Energy prices are also subject to other political and regulatory actions outside our control, which may include changes in the policies of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries or other developments involving or affecting oil-producing countries, or actions or reactions of the government of the United States in anticipation of or in response to such developments.The inability of one or more of our working interest partners to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results.For our operated properties, we pay expenses and bill our non-operating partners for their respective shares of costs. Some of our non-operating partners may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial obligations. Nonperformance by a non-operating partner could result in significant financial losses.20Liquidity problems encountered by our working interest partners or the third party operators of our non-operated properties may also result in significant financial losses as the other working interest partners or third party operators may be unwilling or unable to pay their share of the costs of projects as they become due. In the event a third party operator of a non-operated property becomes insolvent, it may result in increased operating expenses and cash required for abandonment liabilities if the Company is required to take over operatorship. Barnwell holds a 10% working interest in a property with approximately 80 wells where the operator is in receivership. We may incur material costs to comply with or as a result of health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations. The oil and natural gas industry is subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to local, provincial and federal legislation. A violation of that legislation may result in the imposition of fines or the issuance of “clean up” orders. Legislation regulating the oil and natural gas industry may be changed to impose higher standards and potentially more costly obligations. Although we have recorded a provision in our financial statements relating to our estimated future environmental and reclamation obligations that we believe is reasonable, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to satisfy our actual future environmental and reclamation obligations. Barnwell's oil and natural gas segment is subject to the provisions of the Alberta Energy Regulator's (“AER”) Licensee Liability Rating (“LLR”) program. Under the LLR program the AER calculates a Liability Management Ratio (“LMR”) for a company based on the ratio of the company’s deemed assets over its deemed liabilities relating to wells and facilities for which the company is the licensed operator and imposes a security deposit on operators whose estimated liabilities exceed their deemed asset value. At September 30, 2017, the Company had sufficient deemed asset value that no security deposit was due. However, decreases in prices and production and related netbacks from relevant properties could result in a decline in the Company's deemed asset value to a point where a deposit could be due in the future.The AER requires purchasers of AER licensed oil and natural gas assets to have an LMR of 2.0 or higher immediately following the transfer of a license. This LMR requirement for well transfers hinders our ability to generate capital by selling oil and natural gas assets as there are less qualified buyers. Additionally, it inhibits our ability to grow through acquisitions without depositing collateral with the AER, as we currently have an LMR of less than 1.2. A requirement to provide security deposit funds to the AER in the future would result in the diversion of cash on hand and operating cash flows that could otherwise be used to fund oil and natural gas reserve replacement efforts, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If Barnwell fails to comply with the requirements of the LLR program, Barnwell's oil and natural gas subsidiary would be subject to the AER's enforcement provisions which could include suspension of operations and non-compliance fees and could ultimately result in the AER serving the Company with a closure order to shut-in all operated wells. Additionally, if Barnwell is non-compliant, the Company would be prohibited from transferring well licenses which would prohibit us from selling any oil and natural gas assets until the required cash deposit is made with the AER.  We are not fully insured against certain environmental risks, either because such insurance is not available or because of high premium costs. In particular, insurance against risks from environmental pollution occurring over time, as opposed to sudden and catastrophic damages, is not available on economically reasonable terms. Accordingly, any site reclamation or abandonment costs actually incurred in the ordinary course of business in a specific period could negatively impact our cash flow. Should we be unable to fully 21fund the cost of remedying an environmental problem, we might be required to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy. We may fail to fully identify potential problems related to acquired reserves or to properly estimate those reserves. We periodically evaluate acquisitions of reserves, properties, prospects and leaseholds and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategy. Our evaluation includes an assessment of reserves, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, potential for future drilling and production, validity of the seller’s title to the properties and potential environmental issues, litigation and other liabilities. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities or title defects in excess of the amounts claimed by us before closing and acquire properties on an “as is” basis. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and future production rates and costs with respect to acquired properties, and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates.If oil and natural gas prices decline, we may be required to take write-downs of the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties. Oil and natural gas prices affect the value of our oil and natural gas properties as determined in our full cost ceiling calculation. Any future ceiling test write-downs will result in reductions of the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties and an equivalent charge to earnings. The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We compete for capital, acquisitions of reserves, undeveloped lands, skilled personnel, access to drilling rigs, service rigs and other equipment, access to processing facilities, pipeline capacity and in many other respects with a substantial number of other organizations, most of which have greater technical and financial resources than we do. Some of these organizations explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas, carry on refining operations and market oil and other products on a worldwide basis. As a result of these complementary activities, some of our competitors may have competitive resources that are greater and more diverse than ours. Furthermore, many of our competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production, such as changing prices and production levels, the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations. If our competitors are able to capitalize on these competitive resources, it could adversely affect our revenues. 22An increase in operating costs greater than anticipated could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Higher operating costs for our properties will directly decrease the amount of cash flow received by us. Electricity, supplies, and labor costs are a few of the operating costs that are susceptible to material fluctuation. The need for significant repairs and maintenance of infrastructure may increase as our properties age. A significant increase in operating costs could negatively impact operating results and cash flow.Our operating results are affected by our ability to market the oil and natural gas that we produce. Our business depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of oil and natural gas gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities. Canadian federal and provincial, as well as United States federal and state, regulation of oil and natural gas production, processing and transportation, tax and energy policies, general economic conditions, and changes in supply and demand could adversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas. If market factors change and inhibit the marketing of our production, overall production or realized prices may decline. We are not the operator and have limited influence over the operations of the majority of our oil and natural gas properties. We hold minority interests in the majority of our oil and natural gas properties. As a result, we cannot control the pace of exploration or development, major decisions affecting the drilling of wells, the plan for development and production at non-operated properties, or the timing and amount of costs related to abandonment and reclamation activities although contract provisions give Barnwell certain consent rights in some matters. The operator’s influence over these matters can affect the pace at which we incur capital expenditures. Additionally, as certain underlying joint venture data is not accessible to us, we depend on the operators at non-operated properties to provide us with reliable accounting information. We also depend on operators and joint operators to maintain the financial resources to fund their share of all abandonment and reclamation costs. Actual reserves will vary from reserve estimates. Estimating reserves is inherently uncertain and the reserves estimation process involves significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The reserve data and standardized measures set forth herein are only estimates. Ultimately, actual reserves attributable to our properties will vary from estimates, and those variations may be material. The estimation of reserves involves a number of factors and assumptions, including, among others: •oil and natural gas prices as prescribed by SEC regulations;•historical production from our wells compared with production rates from similar producing wells in the area;•future commodity prices, production and development costs, royalties and capital expenditures;•initial production rates;•production decline rates;•ultimate recovery of reserves;•success of future development activities;•marketability of production;•effects of government regulation; and•other government levies that may be imposed over the producing life of reserves.23 If these factors, assumptions and prices prove to be inaccurate, actual results may vary materially from reserve estimates. Delays in business operations could adversely affect the amount and timing of our cash inflows. In addition to the usual delays in payment by purchasers of oil and natural gas to the operators of our properties, and the delays of those operators in remitting payment to us, payments between any of these parties may also be delayed by: •restrictions imposed by lenders;•accounting delays;•delays in the sale or delivery of products;•delays in the connection of wells to a gathering system;•blowouts or other accidents;•adjustments for prior periods;•recovery by the operator of expenses incurred in the operation of the properties; and•the establishment by the operator of reserves for these expenses. Any of these delays could expose us to additional third party credit risks. The oil and natural gas market in which we operate exposes us to potential liabilities that may not be covered by insurance. Our operations are subject to all of the risks associated with the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties, including the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, and the production and transportation of oil and natural gas. These risks include encountering unexpected formations or pressures, premature declines of reservoirs, blow-outs, equipment failures and other accidents, cratering, sour gas releases, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, adverse weather conditions, pollution, other environmental risks, fires and spills. A number of these risks could result in personal injury, loss of life, or environmental and other damage to our property or the property of others. While we maintain reserves for anticipated liabilities and carry various levels of insurance, we could be affected by civil, criminal, regulatory or administrative actions, claims or proceedings. We cannot fully protect against all of the risks listed above, nor are all of these risks insurable. There is no assurance that any applicable insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability for the risks listed above. We could face substantial losses if an event occurs for which we are not fully insured or are not indemnified against or a customer or insurer fails to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations. In addition, there can be no assurance that insurance will continue to be available to cover any or all of these risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive. Deficiencies in operating practices and record keeping, if any, may increase our risks and liabilities relating to incidents such as spills and releases and may increase the level of regulatory enforcement actions. 24Our operations are subject to domestic and foreign government regulation and other risks, particularly in Canada and the United States. Barnwell’s oil and natural gas operations are affected by political developments and laws and regulations, particularly in Canada and the United States, such as restrictions on production, restrictions on imports and exports, the maintenance of specified reserves, tax increases and retroactive tax claims, expropriation of property, cancellation of contract rights, environmental protection controls, environmental compliance requirements and laws pertaining to workers’ health and safety. Further, the right to explore for and develop oil and natural gas on lands in Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia is controlled by the governments of each of those provinces. Changes in royalties and other terms of provincial leases, permits and reservations may have a substantial effect on Barnwell’s operations. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from our operations in Canada; 35% in fiscal 2017. Additionally, our ability to compete in the Canadian oil and natural gas industry may be adversely affected by governmental regulations or other policies that favor the awarding of contracts to contractors in which Canadian nationals have substantial ownership interests. Furthermore, we may face governmentally imposed restrictions or fees from time to time on the transfer of funds to the U.S. Government regulations control and often limit access to potential markets and impose extensive requirements concerning employee safety, environmental protection, pollution control and remediation of environmental contamination. Environmental regulations, in particular, prohibit access to some markets and make others less economical, increase equipment and personnel costs and often impose liability without regard to negligence or fault. In addition, governmental regulations may discourage our customers’ activities, reducing demand for our products and services. Compliance with foreign tax and other laws may adversely affect our operations.Tax and other laws and regulations are not always interpreted consistently among local, regional and national authorities. Income tax laws, other legislation or government incentive programs relating to the oil and natural gas industry may in the future be changed or interpreted in a manner that adversely affects us and our stockholders. It is also possible that in the future we will be subject to disputes concerning taxation and other matters in Canada, including the manner in which we calculate our income for tax purposes, and these disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.Unforeseen title defects may result in a loss of entitlement to production and reserves. Although we conduct title reviews in accordance with industry practice prior to any purchase of resource assets or property, such reviews do not guarantee that an unforeseen defect in the chain of title will not arise and defeat our title to the purchased assets. If such a defect were to occur, our entitlement to the production from such purchased assets could be jeopardized. Risks Related to Land Investment Segment Receipt of future payments from KD I and KD II and cash distributions from the Kukio Resort land development partnerships is dependent upon the developer’s continued efforts and ability to develop and market the property. We have become increasingly dependent on our land investment segment as our revenues, cash flows and profits from our oil and natural gas segment have continued to decline.25We are entitled to receive future payments based on a percentage of the sales prices of residential lots sold within the Kaupulehu area by KD I and KD II as well as a percentage of future distributions KD II makes to its members. However, in order to collect such payments we are reliant upon the developer, KD I and KD II, in which we own a 19.6% ownership interest, to continue to market the remaining lots within Increment I and to proceed with the development or sale of the remaining portion of Increment II. Additionally, future cash distributions from the Kukio Resort land development partnerships, which includes KD I and KD II, are also dependent on future lot sales in Increment I by KD I and the development or sale of Increment II by KD II. It is uncertain when or if KD II will develop or sell the remaining portion of Increment II, and there is no assurance with regards to the amounts of future sales from Increments I and II. The developer is required to submit an overall status report of the project, including the percentage of completed development, by April 20, 2019. There is a possibility that regulatory authorities could impose adverse conditions of approval that impede the developer's goals, or outright refuse to extend the allowed zoning beyond April 20, 2019, which would have an adverse impact on the value of the property. We do not have a controlling interest in the partnerships, and therefore are dependent on the general partner for development decisions. The receipt of future payments and cash distributions could be jeopardized if the developer fails to proceed with development and marketing of the property. We hold investment interests in unconsolidated land development partnerships, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, in which we do not have a controlling interest. These investments involve risks and are highly illiquid. These investments involve risks which include: •the lack of a controlling interest in these partnerships and, therefore, the inability to require that the entities sell assets, return invested capital or take any other action without obtaining the majority vote of partners;•potential for future additional capital contributions to fund operations and development activities;•the adverse impact on overall profitability if the entities do not achieve the financial results projected;•the reallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives and/or an increase in indebtedness to pay potential future additional capital contributions, which could in turn restrict our ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of our business strategy;•undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems, unanticipated costs, and an inability to recover or manage such liabilities and costs; and•certain underlying partnership data is not accessible to us, therefore we depend on the general partner to provide us with reliable accounting information.We may be required to write-down the carrying value of our investment in the Kukio Resort land development partnerships if our assumptions about future lot sales and profitability prove incorrect. Any write-down would negatively impact our results of operations. In analyzing the value of our investment in the Kukio Resort land development partnerships, we have made assumptions about the level of future lot sales, operating and development costs, cash generation and market conditions. These assumptions are based on management’s and the general partner’s best estimates and if the actual results differ significantly from these assumptions, we may not be able to realize the value of the assets recorded, which could lead to an impairment of certain of these assets in the future. Such a write-down would have a negative impact on our results of operations.26 The market value of our real estate interests could decline, which may require further write-downs of the carrying value of our residential lot held for sale to its estimated fair value. Any write-down would negatively impact our results of operations. The market value of our residential lot held for sale can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing economic market conditions. During fiscal 2017, we recorded a $155,000 impairment of the residential lot held for sale as a result of changes in fair values for comparable real estate. If the market conditions deteriorate, we may be required to record an additional write-down of the carrying value of our residential lot held for sale. Such a write-down would have a negative impact on our results of operations.Our land investment business is concentrated in the state of Hawaii. As a result, our financial results are dependent on the economic growth and health of Hawaii, particularly the island of Hawaii. Barnwell’s land investment segment is impacted by the condition of Hawaii’s real estate market, which is affected by Hawaii’s economy and Hawaii’s tourism industry, as well as the United States and world economies in general. Any future cash flows from Barnwell’s land development activities are subject to, among other factors, the level of real estate activity and prices, the demand for new housing and second homes on the island of Hawaii, the rate of increase in the cost of building materials and labor, the introduction of building code modifications, changes to zoning laws, and the level of confidence in Hawaii’s economy. The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business.The occurrence of a natural disaster in Hawaii such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse effect on our land investments. The occurrence of a natural disaster could also cause property and flood insurance rates and deductibles to increase, which could reduce demand for real estate in Hawaii. Risks Related to Contract Drilling Segment Demand for water well drilling and/or pump installation is volatile. A decrease in demand for our services could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. Demand for services is highly dependent upon land development activities in the state of Hawaii. As also noted above, the real estate development industry is cyclical in nature and is particularly vulnerable to shifts in local, regional, and national economic conditions outside of our control such as interest rates, housing demand, population growth, employment levels and job growth and property taxes. A decrease in water well drilling and/or pump installation contracts will result in decreased revenues and operating results. If we are unable to accurately estimate the overall risks, requirements or costs when bidding on or negotiating a contract that is ultimately awarded, we may achieve a lower than anticipated profit or incur a loss on the contract.Contracts are usually fixed price per lineal foot drilled and require the provision of line-item materials at a fixed unit price based on approved quantities irrespective of actual per unit costs. Under such contracts, prices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates, which are based on a number of assumptions, many of which are beyond our control. Expected profits on contracts are realized only if costs are accurately estimated and successfully controlled. We may not be able to obtain compensation for additional work performed or expenses incurred as a result of changes or inaccuracies in these estimates and underlying 27assumptions, such as unanticipated sub-surface site conditions, unanticipated technical problems, equipment failures, inefficiencies, cost of raw materials, schedule delays due to constraints on drilling hours, weather delays, or accidents. If cost estimates for a contract are inaccurate, or if the contract is not performed within cost estimates, then cost overruns may result in losses or cause the contract not to be as profitable as expected.A significant portion of our contract drilling business is dependent on municipalities and a decline in municipal spending could adversely impact our business. A significant portion of our contract drilling division revenues is derived from water and infrastructure contracts with governmental entities or agencies; 76% in fiscal 2017. Reduced tax revenues and governmental budgets may limit spending by local governments which in turn will affect the demand for our services. Material reductions in spending by a significant number of local governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial position. Our contract drilling operations face significant competition. We face competition for our services from a variety of competitors. Many of our competitors utilize drilling rigs that drill as quickly as our equipment but require less labor. Our strategy is to compete based on pricing and to a lesser degree, quality of service. If we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors, our financial results could be adversely affected.The loss of or damage to key vendor, customer or sub-contractor relationships would adversely affect our operations. Our contract drilling business is dependent on our relationships with key vendors, customers and subcontractors. The loss of or damage to any of our key relationships could negatively affect our business. Awarding of contracts is dependent upon our ability to obtain contract bid and performance bonds from insurers. There can be no assurance that our ability to obtain such bonds will continue on the same basis as the past. Additionally, bonding insurance rates may increase and have an impact on our ability to win competitive bids, which could have a corresponding material impact on contract drilling operating results. The contracts in our backlog are subject to change orders and cancellation. Our backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under contracts that have been started and new contracts not yet started. Our contracts are subject to change orders and cancellations, and such changes could adversely affect our operations. The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business. The occurrence of a natural disaster in Hawaii such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete our contracts"
9,BRN,BARNWELL INDUSTRIES,2016-12-20,"ITEM 1A.                         RISK FACTORS The business of Barnwell and its subsidiaries face numerous risks, including those set forth below or those described elsewhere in this Form 10-K or in Barnwell’s other filings with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only risks that Barnwell faces. If any of the following risk factors should occur, our profitability, financial condition or liquidity could be materially negatively impacted. Entity-Wide RisksThe Company faces issues that could impair our ability to continue as a going concern in the future.Due to the negative impacts of 1) declines in oil and natural gas prices; 2) declines in oil and natural gas production due to both oil and natural gas property sales and the natural decline oil and natural gas wells experience as they age; 3) increasing costs due to both inflation and the age of Barnwell's properties and other factors, Barnwell's existing oil and natural gas assets are projected to have minimal cash flow from operations. As a result, the Company's current cash on hand will likely not be sufficient to fund both the significant reinvestments that are necessary to sustain our oil and natural gas business in the future and our asset retirement obligations, retirement plan funding, and ongoing operating and general and administrative expenses. Therefore, it is likely that Barnwell will be increasingly reliant upon future land investment segment proceeds from percentage of sales payments, if any, and future cash distributions, if any, from the Kukio Resort land development partnerships, the timing of which are both highly uncertain and not within Barnwell’s control, to fund operations and provide capital for reinvestment. If the Company is unable to make sufficient and successful reinvestments, or if unforeseen circumstances arise that impair our ability to sustain or grow the Company, we may be forced to wind down our operations, either through liquidation, bankruptcy or further sales of our assets, and/or we may not be able to continue as a going concern in the longer term beyond one year.Our revenues decreased significantly in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, and there can be no assurances that our revenues will not continue to decline.Our consolidated revenues have been declining rapidly for years.  In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, our consolidated revenues declined by 24% from fiscal 2015. Backing out the $5,700,000 of revenues attributable to the one-time sale of a residential property in fiscal 2016, our consolidated revenues declined by 57% from fiscal 2015. The declines in revenues were significant across all of our business segments in fiscal 2016, other than the residential real estate segment which includes the sale of the home. We need to generate new revenues quickly and there can be no assurances that we will be successful in doing so. Our failure to increase our revenues and grow our profitability may force us to wind down our operations, either through liquidation, bankruptcy or further sales of our assets.  We may not be able to continue as a going concern in the longer term beyond one year.We incurred a loss before equity in income of affiliates and income taxes of $6.2 million and a net loss attributable to Barnwell stockholders of $3.6 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, and we may incur additional losses in fiscal 2017. We cannot give assurances of our future profitability.We incurred these significant losses because our operating expenses, including our general and administrative expenses, substantially exceeded our revenues. While we have recently undertaken steps to reduce our overhead expenses, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve cost savings at levels that would return us to profitability, particularly in light of the pressure on our revenues.18A small number of stockholders, including our CEO and President, own a significant amount of our common stock and have influence over our business regardless of the opposition of other stockholders. As of September 30, 2016, four of our stockholders, including our CEO and President, held approximately 44% of our outstanding common stock. The interests of one or more of these stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders. These stockholders have significant influence over all matters submitted to our stockholders, including the election of our directors, and could accelerate, delay, deter or prevent a change of control of the Company. The significant stockholders who also are executive officers could significantly affect our business, policies and affairs.Our operations are subject to currency rate fluctuations. Our operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar. Our financial statements, presented in U.S. dollars, may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk. Volatility in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations, particularly through the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar which may affect the relative prices at which we sell our oil and natural gas and may affect the cost of certain items required in our operations. To date, we have not entered into foreign currency hedging transactions to control or minimize these risks.Adverse changes in actuarial assumptions used to calculate retirement plan costs due to economic or other factors, or lower returns on plan assets could adversely affect Barnwell’s results and financial condition. Retirement plan cash funding obligations and plan expenses and obligations are subject to a high degree of uncertainty and could increase in future years depending on numerous factors, including the performance of the financial markets, specifically the equity markets, levels of interest rates, and the cost of health care insurance premiums.The price of our common stock has been volatile and could continue to fluctuate substantially. The market price of our common stock has been volatile and could fluctuate based on a variety of factors, including: •fluctuations in commodity prices;•variations in results of operations;•announcements by us and our competitors;•legislative or regulatory changes;•general trends in the industry;•general market conditions; •litigation; and•analysts’ estimates and other events applicable to our industries.  Failure to retain key personnel could hurt our operations. We require highly skilled and experienced personnel to operate our business. In addition to competing in highly competitive industries, we compete in a highly competitive labor market. Our business could be adversely affected by an inability to retain personnel or upward pressure on wages as a result of the highly competitive labor market. Further, there are significant personal liability risks to Barnwell of Canada's 19individual officers and directors related to well clean-up costs that may affect our ability to attract or retain the necessary people.  We are a smaller reporting company and are taking advantage of certain reduced governance and disclosure requirements, including that our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We cannot be certain if the omission of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.Currently, we are a “smaller reporting company,” meaning that our outstanding common stock held by nonaffiliates had a value of less than $75 million at the end of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, meaning our auditors are not required to attest to the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. As a result, investors and others may be less comfortable with the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls and the risk that material weaknesses or other deficiencies in internal controls go undetected may increase. In addition, as a smaller reporting company, we take advantage of our ability to provide certain other less comprehensive disclosures in our SEC filings, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements in annual reports and simplified executive compensation disclosures.  Consequently, it may be more challenging for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects, as the information we provide to stockholders may be different from what one might receive from other public companies in which one hold shares. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide this information.Risks Related to Oil and Natural Gas Segment Acquisitions or discoveries of additional reserves are needed to increase our oil and natural gas segment operating results and cash flow. In September 2015, we sold our interests in our principal oil and natural gas properties located in the Dunvegan and Belloy areas of Alberta, Canada. The sale of Dunvegan resulted in a 60% decrease in our proved natural gas reserves and a 34% decrease in our proved oil and natural gas liquids reserves. In fiscal 2015, Dunvegan accounted for 74% of our net natural gas production and 44% of our net oil and natural gas liquids production, and contributed 46% of our total oil and natural gas revenues. As a result of this sale, our oil and natural gas revenues and cash flow have significantly declined. Reinvestment in oil and natural gas segment assets are needed to replace the significant amount of reserves sold in fiscal 2015 and reserves produced. Future oil and natural gas operating results and cash flow are, therefore, highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves on an economic basis. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in developing or acquiring additional reserves and our current financial resources may be insufficient to make such investments. Furthermore, if oil or natural gas prices increase, our cost for additional reserves could also increase. We may have difficulty funding oil and natural gas segment capital expenditures which could have an adverse effect on our business. Our oil and natural gas acquisition and development activities require substantial capital expenditures which we intend to fund using cash on hand and cash flows from operations. However, the Company's current cash on hand may be needed to fund upcoming cash needs including asset retirement obligations, retirement plan funding, and ongoing operating and general and administrative expenses, such that some or potentially 20all of the cash will not be available for reinvestment. Future cash flows from operations are uncertain and are based on a number of variables including the level of production from existing wells, oil and natural gas prices, and our success in acquiring and developing new reserves. Barnwell's existing oil and natural gas assets are projected to have minimal cash flow from operations at current prices and production levels.In April 2016, Barnwell’s $1,000,000 Canadian-dollar revolving credit facility at Royal Bank of Canada was terminated. The termination was due to Barnwell's significant reduction in reserves as a result of the sale of its interests in oil and natural gas properties located in the Dunvegan and Belloy areas in September 2015 as well as a tightening credit market for oil and natural gas companies due to current low oil and natural gas prices and reductions in Royal Bank of Canada's forecast of oil and natural gas prices which decreased its valuation of the Company's remaining oil and natural gas assets pledged as security. In June 2016, Barnwell entered into a new agreement with Royal Bank of Canada for a revolving demand facility in the amount of $500,000 Canadian dollars, or U.S. $381,000 at the September 30, 2016 exchange rate, which is secured by a $500,000 Canadian dollar, or U.S. $381,000, guaranteed investment certificate pledged to the Royal Bank of Canada. This leaves Barnwell with minimal available credit under the new revolving demand facility.Disruptions in the capital and credit markets, in particular with respect to companies in the energy sector, could limit our ability to access these markets or may significantly increase our cost to borrow. Recent decreases in commodity prices, among other factors, are causing and may continue to cause lenders to increase interest rates, enact tighter lending standards which we may not satisfy, and reduce or cease to provide funding to borrowers. If additional capital is required, we may not be able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us, or at all. If cash on hand and cash generated by operations is not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could limit our ability to fund capital expenditures, and we may be forced to curtail our oil and natural gas activities or be forced to sell some of our oil and natural gas segment assets under untimely or unfavorable terms. Any such curtailment or sale could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not realize an adequate return on oil and natural gas investments. Drilling for oil and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs. The wells we drill or participate in may not be productive, and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in those wells. If future oil and natural gas segment acquisition and development activities are not successful it could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. We may incur material costs to comply with or as a result of health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations. The oil and natural gas industry is subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to local, provincial and federal legislation. A violation of that legislation may result in the imposition of fines or the issuance of “clean up” orders. Legislation regulating the oil and natural gas industry may be changed to impose higher standards and potentially more costly obligations. Although we have recorded a provision in our financial statements relating to our estimated future environmental and reclamation obligations that we believe is reasonable, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to satisfy our actual future environmental and reclamation obligations. Barnwell's oil and natural gas segment is subject to the provisions of the Alberta Energy Regulator's (“AER”) Licensee Liability Rating (“LLR”) program. Under the LLR program the AER calculates a Liability 21Management Ratio (“LMR”) for a company based on the ratio of the company’s deemed assets over its deemed liabilities relating to wells and facilities for which the company is the licensed operator and imposes a security deposit on operators whose estimated liabilities exceed their deemed asset value. At September 30, 2016, the Company had sufficient deemed asset value that no security deposit was due. However, decreases in prices and production and related netbacks from relevant properties could result in a decline in the Company's deemed asset value to a point where a deposit could be due in the future. It is also possible that we may have to transfer well licenses with favorable LMRs resulting in an overall reduction in our remaining LMR. In June 2016, the AER implemented changes in the Liability Management Program (""LMP"") which now requires purchasers of AER licensed oil and natural gas assets to have an LMR of 2.0 or higher immediately following a transfer, up from the previous requirement of 1.0 or higher. This change in the LMR requirement for well transfers will result in significantly less qualified buyers and may hinder our ability to generate capital by selling oil and natural gas assets. Additionally, it may inhibit our ability to grow through acquisitions without depositing collateral with the AER, as we do not currently have an LMR of 2.0 or higher. Additionally, in July 2014, the AER introduced an Inactive Well Compliance Program which resulted in the acceleration of expenditures to suspend and/or abandon long-term inactive wells.A requirement to provide security deposit funds to the AER in the future would result in the diversion of operating cash flows that could otherwise be used to fund oil and natural gas reserve replacement efforts, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If Barnwell fails to comply with the requirements of the LLR program, Barnwell's oil and natural gas subsidiary would be subject to the AER's enforcement provisions which could include suspension of operations and non-compliance fees and could ultimately result in the AER serving the Company with a closure order to shut-in all operated wells. Additionally, if Barnwell is non-compliant, the Company would be prohibited from transferring well licenses which would prohibit us from selling any oil and natural gas assets until the required cash deposit is made with the AER.  We are not fully insured against certain environmental risks, either because such insurance is not available or because of high premium costs. In particular, insurance against risks from environmental pollution occurring over time, as opposed to sudden and catastrophic damages, is not available on economically reasonable terms. Accordingly, any site reclamation or abandonment costs actually incurred in the ordinary course of business in a specific period could negatively impact our cash flow. Should we be unable to fully fund the cost of remedying an environmental problem, we might be required to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy. We may fail to fully identify potential problems related to acquired reserves or to properly estimate those reserves. We periodically evaluate acquisitions of reserves, properties, prospects and leaseholds and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategy. Our evaluation includes an assessment of reserves, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, potential for future drilling and production, validity of the seller’s title to the properties and potential environmental issues, litigation and other liabilities. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and 22potential recoverable reserves. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities or title defects in excess of the amounts claimed by us before closing and acquire properties on an “as is” basis. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and future production rates and costs with respect to acquired properties, and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates.Oil and natural gas prices are highly volatile and further declines, or extended low prices will significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.  Much of our revenues and cash flow are greatly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas. Lower oil and natural gas prices not only decrease our revenues on a per unit basis, but also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce economically, if any. Continued depressed prices will have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, operating cash flows, borrowing ability, reserves, and the amount of capital that we are able to allocate for the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas reserves.Various factors beyond our control affect prices of oil and natural gas including, but not limited to, changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty, weather, worldwide political instability, foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the level of consumer product demand, government regulations and taxes, the price and availability of alternative fuels and the overall economic environment. Energy prices are also subject to other political and regulatory actions outside our control, which may include changes in the policies of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries or other developments involving or affecting oil-producing countries, or actions or reactions of the government of the United States in anticipation of or in response to such developments.If oil and natural gas prices remain at their current level for an extended period of time or continue to decline, we may be required to take write-downs of the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties. Oil and natural gas prices affect the value of our oil and natural gas properties as determined in our full cost ceiling calculation. Any future ceiling test write-downs will result in reductions of the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties and an equivalent charge to earnings. The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We compete for capital, acquisitions of reserves, undeveloped lands, skilled personnel, access to drilling rigs, service rigs and other equipment, access to processing facilities, pipeline capacity and in many other respects with a substantial number of other organizations, many of which may have greater technical and financial resources than we do. Some of these organizations explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas, carry on refining operations and market oil and other products on a worldwide basis. As a result of these complementary activities, some of our competitors may have competitive resources that are greater and more diverse than ours. Furthermore, many of our competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production, such as changing prices and production levels, the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations. If our competitors are able to capitalize on these competitive resources, it could adversely affect our revenues.23 An increase in operating costs greater than anticipated could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Higher operating costs for our properties will directly decrease the amount of cash flow received by us. Electricity, supplies, and labor costs are a few of the operating costs that are susceptible to material fluctuation. The need for significant repairs and maintenance of infrastructure may increase as our properties age. A significant increase in operating costs could result in materially lower operating results and cash flow.Our operating results are affected by our ability to market the oil and natural gas that we produce. Our business depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of oil and natural gas gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities. Canadian federal and provincial, as well as United States federal and state, regulation of oil and natural gas production, processing and transportation, tax and energy policies, general economic conditions, and changes in supply and demand could adversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas. If market factors change and inhibit the marketing of our production, overall production or realized prices may decline. We are not the operator and have limited influence over the operations of the majority of our oil and natural gas properties. We hold minority interests in the majority of our oil and natural gas properties. As a result, we cannot control the pace of exploration or development, major decisions affecting the drilling of wells, the plan for development and production at non-operated properties, or the timing and amount of costs related to abandonment and reclamation activities although contract provisions give Barnwell certain consent rights in some matters. The operator’s influence over these matters can affect the pace at which we incur capital expenditures. Additionally, as certain underlying joint venture data is not accessible to us, we depend on the operators at non-operated properties to provide us with reliable accounting information. We also depend on operators and joint operators to maintain the financial resources to fund their share of all abandonment and reclamation costs. The inability of one or more of our working interest partners to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results.For our operated properties, we pay expenses and bill our non-operating partners for their respective shares of costs. Some of our non-operating partners may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial obligations. Nonperformance by a non-operating partner could result in significant financial losses.Liquidity problems encountered by our working interest partners or the third party operators of our non-operated properties may also result in significant financial losses as the other working interest partners or third party operators may be unwilling or unable to pay their share of the costs of projects as they become due.24Actual reserves will vary from reserve estimates. Estimating reserves is inherently uncertain and the reserves estimation process involves significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The reserve data and standardized measures set forth herein are only estimates. Ultimately, actual reserves attributable to our properties will vary from estimates, and those variations may be material. The estimation of reserves involves a number of factors and assumptions, including, among others: •oil and natural gas prices as prescribed by SEC regulations;•historical production from our wells compared with production rates from similar producing wells in the area;•future commodity prices, production and development costs, royalties and capital expenditures;•initial production rates;•production decline rates;•ultimate recovery of reserves;•success of future development activities;•marketability of production;•effects of government regulation; and•other government levies that may be imposed over the producing life of reserves. If these factors, assumptions and prices prove to be inaccurate, actual results may vary materially from reserve estimates. Delays in business operations could adversely affect the amount and timing of our cash inflows. In addition to the usual delays in payment by purchasers of oil and natural gas to the operators of our properties, and the delays of those operators in remitting payment to us, payments between any of these parties may also be delayed by: •restrictions imposed by lenders;•accounting delays;•delays in the sale or delivery of products;•delays in the connection of wells to a gathering system;•blowouts or other accidents;•adjustments for prior periods;•recovery by the operator of expenses incurred in the operation of the properties; and•the establishment by the operator of reserves for these expenses. Any of these delays could expose us to additional third party credit risks. The oil and natural gas market in which we operate exposes us to potential liabilities that may not be covered by insurance. Our operations are subject to all of the risks associated with the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties, including the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, and the production and transportation of oil and natural gas. These risks include encountering unexpected formations or pressures, premature declines of reservoirs, blow-outs, equipment failures and other accidents, cratering, sour gas releases, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, adverse weather conditions, pollution, other 25environmental risks, fires and spills. A number of these risks could result in personal injury, loss of life, or environmental and other damage to our property or the property of others. While we maintain reserves for anticipated liabilities and carry various levels of insurance, we could be affected by civil, criminal, regulatory or administrative actions, claims or proceedings. We cannot fully protect against all of the risks listed above, nor are all of these risks insurable. There is no assurance that any applicable insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability for the risks listed above. We could face substantial losses if an event occurs for which we are not fully insured or are not indemnified against or a customer or insurer fails to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations. In addition, there can be no assurance that insurance will continue to be available to cover any or all of these risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive. Deficiencies in operating practices and record keeping, if any, may increase our risks and liabilities relating to incidents such as spills and releases and may increase the level of regulatory enforcement actions. Our operations are subject to domestic and foreign government regulation and other risks, particularly in Canada and the United States. Barnwell’s oil and natural gas operations are affected by political developments and laws and regulations, particularly in Canada and the United States, such as restrictions on production, restrictions on imports and exports, the maintenance of specified reserves, tax increases and retroactive tax claims, expropriation of property, cancellation of contract rights, environmental protection controls, environmental compliance requirements and laws pertaining to workers’ health and safety. Further, the right to explore for and develop oil and natural gas on lands in Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia is controlled by the governments of each of those provinces. Changes in royalties and other terms of provincial leases, permits and reservations may have a substantial effect on Barnwell’s operations. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from our operations in Canada; 26% in fiscal 2016. Additionally, our ability to compete in the Canadian oil and natural gas industry may be adversely affected by governmental regulations or other policies that favor the awarding of contracts to contractors in which Canadian nationals have substantial ownership interests. Furthermore, we may face governmentally imposed restrictions or fees from time to time on the transfer of funds to the U.S. Government regulations control and often limit access to potential markets and impose extensive requirements concerning employee safety, environmental protection, pollution control and remediation of environmental contamination. Environmental regulations, in particular, prohibit access to some markets and make others less economical, increase equipment and personnel costs and often impose liability without regard to negligence or fault. In addition, governmental regulations may discourage our customers’ activities, reducing demand for our products and services. Compliance with foreign tax and other laws may adversely affect our operations.Tax and other laws and regulations are not always interpreted consistently among local, regional and national authorities. Income tax laws, other legislation or government incentive programs relating to the oil and natural gas industry may in the future be changed or interpreted in a manner that adversely affects us and our stockholders. It is also possible that in the future we will be subject to disputes concerning taxation and other matters in Canada, including the manner in which we calculate our income for tax purposes, and these disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.26Unforeseen title defects may result in a loss of entitlement to production and reserves. Although we conduct title reviews in accordance with industry practice prior to any purchase of resource assets or property, such reviews do not guarantee that an unforeseen defect in the chain of title will not arise and defeat our title to the purchased assets. If such a defect were to occur, our entitlement to the production from such purchased assets could be jeopardized. Risks Related to Land Investment Segment Receipt of future percentage of sales payments from KD I and KD II and cash distributions from the Kukio Resort land development partnerships is dependent upon the developer’s continued efforts to develop and market the property. We have become increasingly dependent on the percentage of sales payments and cash distributions from our land investment segment as our revenues, cash flows and profits from our oil and natural gas business have continued to decline.We are entitled to receive future payments based on a percentage of the sales prices of residential lots sold within the Kaupulehu area. However, in order to collect such percentage of sales payments we are reliant upon the developer, KD I and KD II, in which we own a 19.6% ownership interest, to continue to develop and market the lots. Additionally, future cash distributions from the Kukio Resort land development partnerships, which includes KD I and KD II, are dependent on future lot sales, specifically the remaining two acre ocean front parcel in Increment II by KD II. We do not have a controlling interest in the partnerships, and therefore are dependent on the general partner for development decisions. The receipt of future percentage of sales payments and cash distributions could be jeopardized if the developer fails to proceed with development and marketing of the property. We hold investment interests in unconsolidated land development partnerships, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, in which we do not have a controlling interest. These investments involve risks and are highly illiquid. These investments involve risks which include: •the lack of a controlling interest in these partnerships and, therefore, the inability to require that the entities sell assets, return invested capital or take any other action without obtaining the majority vote of partners;•potential for future additional capital contributions to fund operations and development activities;•the adverse impact on overall profitability if the entities do not achieve the financial results projected;•the reallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives and/or an increase in indebtedness to pay potential future additional capital contributions, which could in turn restrict our ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of our business strategy;•undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems, unanticipated costs, and an inability to recover or manage such liabilities and costs; and•certain underlying partnership data is not accessible to us, therefore we depend on the general partner to provide us with reliable accounting information.27We may be required to write-down the carrying value of our investment in the Kukio Resort land development partnerships if our assumptions about future lot sales and profitability prove incorrect. Any write-down would negatively impact our results of operations. In analyzing the value of our investment in the Kukio Resort land development partnerships, we have made assumptions about the level of future lot sales, operating and development costs, cash generation and market conditions. These assumptions are based on management’s and the general partner’s best estimates and if the actual results differ significantly from these assumptions, we may not be able to realize the value of the assets recorded, which could lead to an impairment of certain of these assets in the future. Such a write-down would have a negative impact on our results of operations. The market value of our real estate interests could decline, which may require a write-down of the carrying value of our residential lot held for sale to its estimated fair value. Any write-down would negatively impact our results of operations. The market value of our residential lot held for sale can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing economic market conditions. If the market conditions deteriorate, we may be required to write-down the carrying value of our  residential lot held for sale. Such write-down would have a negative impact on our results of operations.Our land investment business is concentrated in the state of Hawaii. As a result, our financial results are dependent on the economic growth and health of Hawaii, particularly the island of Hawaii. Barnwell’s land investment segment is impacted by the condition of Hawaii’s real estate market, which is affected by Hawaii’s economy and Hawaii’s tourism industry, as well as the United States and world economies in general. Any future cash flows from Barnwell’s land development activities are subject to, among other factors, the level of real estate activity and prices, the demand for new housing and second homes on the island of Hawaii, the rate of increase in the cost of building materials and labor, the introduction of building code modifications, changes to zoning laws, and the level of confidence in Hawaii’s economy. We may be adversely impacted by the failure of the land development partnerships to fulfill their commitments. Barnwell, as well as KD I, KD II and certain other owners of the partnerships, have jointly and severally executed a surety indemnification agreement. Bonds issued by the surety relate to certain construction contracts of KD I. If any such performance bonds are called, we may be obligated to reimburse the issuer of the performance bond as Barnwell, KD I and certain other owners are jointly and severally liable. If the partnerships do not fulfill their commitments, we may be required to expend additional resources or suffer losses, which could be significant. The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business.The occurrence of a natural disaster in Hawaii such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop and sell properties or realize income from our projects. The occurrence of a natural disaster could also cause property and flood insurance rates and deductibles to increase, which could reduce demand for our properties.28Our business is subject to extensive regulation which makes it difficult and expensive for us to conduct our operations. We are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to land use and development and to environmental compliance and permitting obligations, including those related to the use, storage, discharge, emission, and disposal of hazardous materials. In most cases, approval to develop requires multiple permits which involve a long, uncertain and costly regulatory process. Any failure to comply with these laws could result in capital or operating expenditures or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations that could adversely affect present and future operations, or jeopardize our ability to sell the leasehold interest currently held. Risks Related to Contract Drilling Segment Demand for water well drilling and/or pump installation is volatile. A decrease in demand for our services could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. Demand for services is highly dependent upon land development activities in the state of Hawaii. As also noted above, the real estate development industry is cyclical in nature and is particularly vulnerable to shifts in local, regional, and national economic conditions outside of our control such as interest rates, housing demand, population growth, employment levels and job growth and property taxes. A decrease in water well drilling and/or pump installation contracts will result in decreased revenues and operating results. A significant portion of our contract drilling business is dependent on municipalities and a decline in municipal spending could adversely impact our business. A significant portion of our contract drilling division revenues is derived from water and infrastructure contracts with governmental entities or agencies; 36% in fiscal 2016. Reduced tax revenues and governmental budgets may limit spending by local governments which in turn will affect the demand for our services. Material reductions in spending by a significant number of local governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial position. Our contract drilling operations face significant competition. We face competition for our services from a variety of competitors. Many of our competitors utilize drilling rigs that drill as quickly as our equipment but require less labor. Our strategy is to compete based on pricing and to a lesser degree, quality of service. If we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors, our financial results could be adversely affected.The loss of or damage to key vendor, customer or sub-contractor relationships would adversely affect our operations. Our contract drilling business is dependent on our relationships with key vendors, customers and subcontractors. The loss of or damage to any of our key relationships could negatively affect our business. 29Awarding of contracts is dependent upon our ability to obtain contract bid and performance bonds from insurers. There can be no assurance that our ability to obtain such bonds will continue on the same basis as the past. Additionally, bonding insurance rates may increase and have an impact on our ability to win competitive bids, which could have a corresponding material impact on contract drilling operating results. The contracts in our backlog are subject to change orders and cancellation. Our backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under contracts that have been started and new contracts not yet started. Our contracts are subject to change orders and cancellations, and such changes could adversely affect our operations. The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business. The occurrence of a natural disaster in Hawaii such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete our contracts"
8,BRN,BARNWELL INDUSTRIES,2015-12-16,"ITEM 1A.                         RISK FACTORS The business of Barnwell and its subsidiaries face numerous risks, including those set forth below or those described elsewhere in this Form 10-K or in Barnwell’s other filings with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only risks that Barnwell faces. If any of the following risk factors should occur, our profitability, financial condition or liquidity could be materially negatively impacted. Entity-Wide RisksThe substantial declines in oil and natural gas prices have adversely affected our business, financial condition, cash flow, liquidity and results of operations, resulting in issues that may impair our ability to continue as a going concern in the future.Much of our revenues and cash flow are greatly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas. Our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity and to obtain additional capital on attractive terms is also dependent on oil and natural gas prices. Lower oil and natural gas prices not only decrease our revenues on a per unit basis, but also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce economically, if any.In September 2015, Barnwell sold its interests in its principal oil and natural gas properties located in the Dunvegan and Belloy areas of Alberta, Canada. Barnwell's net proceeds from the sale, after broker's fees and other closing costs, were $14,162,000 of which $7,135,000 was withheld in an escrow account for the Canada Revenue Agency for potential amounts due for Barnwell’s Canadian income taxes related to the sale. Management believes all necessary Canadian income taxes related to the sale have been paid as of September 30, 2015, however the sufficiency of Canadian income taxes paid and the precise timing for and amount of the release of these funds to Barnwell cannot be determined until formal determination by the Canada Revenue Agency. The sales proceeds received upon closing were used for Canadian income tax payments and repayment of the $4,800,000 outstanding on the Canadian revolving credit facility.As a result of the sale of  Dunvegan, our Canadian revolving credit facility was amended on September 30, 2015 to decrease the amount of the borrowing capacity from $6,500,000 Canadian dollars to $1,000,000 Canadian dollars, or U.S. $747,000 at the September 30, 2015 exchange rate. In addition, the credit facility is subject to periodic redetermination and renewal and there is no assurance that the borrowing capacity will not be reduced further in April 2016. This leaves Barnwell with minimal available credit under the facility.Because of the combined impact of declines in oil and natural gas prices, declines in production due to oil and natural gas property sales, and natural declines in production and increasing costs due to the age of Barnwell's properties, Barnwell's oil and natural gas segment is projected to have negative cash flow from operations at current prices and production levels. These factors have also resulted in the significant decrease in the borrowing capacity of our Canadian revolving credit facility. Consequently, Barnwell is reliant upon the release of the Dunvegan sales proceeds held in escrow, the timing of which is uncertain, and land investment segment proceeds from percentage of sales payments and any potential future cash distributions from the Kukio Resort land development partnerships in order to provide sufficient liquidity to fund our future cash needs, including capital expenditures, asset retirement obligations, and general and administrative expenses. Furthermore, even if the release of the Dunvegan sales proceeds held in escrow and land investment segment proceeds provide sufficient liquidity, all or a portion of those proceeds may be needed to fund ongoing operating and general and administrative expenses and asset retirement obligations, in which case such proceeds would not be reinvested. 18The amount and timing of future land investment segment proceeds from percentage of sales payments and cash distributions from the Kukio Resort land development partnerships are not under our influence or control and are highly uncertain, and the amount of future proceeds may not provide the liquidity required. There is no assurance with regards to the amount of any such future proceeds. Our liquidity issues may force us to drastically curtail existing operations, reduce or delay capital expenditures, or sell assets on less favorable terms. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to secure the sale of any of its assets or realize enough proceeds from such sales to fund its operations or to otherwise resolve its liquidity issues. Such issues could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If liquidity issues continue beyond one year and are such that the Company is not able to sufficiently reinvest its restricted cash, the Company's ability to continue as a going concern in the longer term will become questionable.Our future level of indebtedness and the terms of our financing arrangements may adversely affect our operations and financial condition.At September 30, 2015, we had borrowings under our real estate loan of approximately $3.4 million. Barnwell repaid the Canadian revolving credit facility in full from the proceeds of the Dunvegan disposition, and the credit facility was amended on September 30, 2015 to reduce the borrowing capacity from $6,500,000 Canadian dollars to $1,000,000 Canadian dollars, or U.S. $747,000 at the September 30, 2015 exchange rate. The terms of our Canadian revolving credit facility and real estate loan impose restrictions on our ability and, in some cases, the ability of our subsidiaries to take a number of actions that we may otherwise desire to take, including one or more of the following: •incurring additional debt, including guarantees of indebtedness;•making investments;•creating liens on our assets; and•selling assets.Our level of indebtedness and the covenants contained in our financing agreements could have important consequences. For example, they could: •limit our ability to obtain future financing, through equity offerings or debt financings, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, refinancing of indebtedness or general corporate and other activities;•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow for other purposes (i.e., working capital, capital expenditures, and other general business activities);•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, the changes in our business;•subject us to higher costs and more restrictive covenants in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes, if additional financing is obtained;•make us vulnerable to increases in interest rates as our credit facilities are subject to variable interest rates;•detract from our ability to successfully withstand a downturn in our business or the economy generally; and•make us more vulnerable to general economic downturns and adverse developments in our industries, especially declines in oil and natural gas prices, and the economy in general.19We may incur additional debt, including significant secured indebtedness, or issue additional stock in order to fund our investments and operations. A higher level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our obligations, especially given the aforementioned uncertainties regarding the Company's liquidity. Our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance. General economic conditions, oil and natural gas prices and financial, business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control. Factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through a refinancing of our debt include financial market conditions, the value of our assets and our performance at the time we need capital. The price of our common stock has been volatile and could continue to fluctuate substantially. The market price of our common stock has been volatile and could fluctuate based on a variety of factors, including: •fluctuations in commodity prices;•variations in results of operations;•announcements by us and our competitors;•legislative or regulatory changes;•general trends in the industry;•general market conditions; •litigation; and•analysts’ estimates and other events applicable to our industries. Our operations are subject to currency rate fluctuations. Our operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar. Our financial statements, presented in U.S. dollars, may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk. Volatility in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations, particularly through the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar which may affect the relative prices at which we sell our oil and natural gas and may affect the cost of certain items required in our operations. To date, we have not entered into foreign currency hedging transactions to control or minimize these risks. Failure to retain key personnel could hurt our operations. We require highly skilled and experienced personnel to operate our business. In addition to competing in highly competitive industries, we compete in a highly competitive labor market. Our business could be adversely affected by an inability to retain personnel or upward pressure on wages as a result of the highly competitive labor market. A small number of stockholders, including our CEO and President, own a significant amount of our common stock and have influence over our business regardless of the opposition of other stockholders. As of September 30, 2015, four of our stockholders, including our CEO and President, held approximately 44% of our outstanding common stock. The interests of one or more of these stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders. These stockholders have significant influence over all matters submitted to our stockholders, including the election of our directors, and could accelerate, delay, deter or prevent a change of control of the Company. The significant stockholders who also are executive officers could significantly affect our business, policies and affairs.20Adverse changes in actuarial assumptions used to calculate retirement plan costs due to economic or other factors, or lower returns on plan assets could adversely affect Barnwell’s results and financial condition. Retirement plan cash funding obligations and plan expenses and obligations are subject to a high degree of uncertainty and could increase in future years depending on numerous factors, including the performance of the financial markets, specifically the equity markets, and the levels of interest rates. Risks Related to Oil and Natural Gas Segment Oil and natural gas prices are volatile. Our results of operations and financial condition are highly dependent on the prices of and demand for our oil and natural gas production.  Oil and natural gas prices are volatile and have substantially declined since September 2014. Various factors beyond our control affect prices of oil an natural gas including, but not limited to, changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty, weather, worldwide political instability, foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the level of consumer product demand, government regulations and taxes, the price and availability of alternative fuels and the overall economic environment. Any further declines in oil or natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce economically, if any, and may have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, operating cash flows, borrowing ability, reserves, and the amount of capital that we are able to allocate for the development of oil and natural gas reserves. Energy prices are also subject to other political and regulatory actions outside our control, which may include changes in the policies of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries or other developments involving or affecting oil-producing countries, or actions or reactions of the government of the United States in anticipation of or in response to such developments. Additionally, we follow the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our oil and natural gas properties. Under this method, the net book value of properties less related deferred income taxes, may not exceed a calculated “ceiling,” which is based upon the estimated after tax discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas properties. The excess, if any, of the net book value above the ceiling is required to be written off as an expense. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” for further details. A sufficient decline in oil or natural gas prices or other factors, without other mitigating circumstances, could result in future reductions of the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties and an equivalent charge to earnings. We may have difficulty funding our oil and natural gas segment investments and may not be successful with such investments, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Because of the combined impact of declines in oil and natural gas prices, declines in production due to oil and natural gas property sales, and natural declines in production and increasing costs due to the age of Barnwell's properties, Barnwell's oil and natural gas segment is projected to have significantly lower revenues and negative cash flow from operations at current prices and production levels, which will significantly impact the amount of cash flow from operations available for reinvestment. The timing of any future re-investment of the Dunvegan proceeds is dependent on the release of the $7,135,000 currently held in escrow for the Canada Revenue Agency as the proceeds received  upon closing 21were used for Canadian income tax payments and repayment of the $4,800,000 outstanding on the Canadian revolving credit facility. However, all or a portion of those proceeds may be needed to fund ongoing operating and general and administrative expenses and asset retirement obligations, in which case such proceeds would not be reinvested. The precise timing for and amount of the release of these funds to Barnwell cannot be determined until formal determination by the Canada Revenue Agency.  As a result of the sale of  Dunvegan, the Company's principal oil and natural gas property, in September 2015, our Canadian revolving credit facility was amended on September 30, 2015 to decrease the amount of the borrowing capacity from $6,500,000 Canadian dollars to $1,000,000 Canadian dollars, or U.S. $747,000 at the September 30, 2015 exchange rate. In addition, the credit facility is subject to periodic redetermination and renewal and there is no assurance that the borrowing capacity will not be reduced further in April 2016. This leaves Barnwell with minimal available credit under the facility.We may not be able to generate sufficient operating cash flows or secure necessary financing on reasonable terms or at all and financing may not continue to be available to us under our existing financing arrangements. If funding resources are unavailable, we may be forced to curtail our oil and natural gas activities or be forced to sell some of our oil and natural gas segment assets under untimely or unfavorable terms. Any such curtailment or sale could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Investments in oil and natural gas segment assets are needed to replace the assets depleted or sold and to avoid a material decline in the remaining reserves and production. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in developing additional reserves or acquiring additional reserves. Without these reserve additions, our reserves will deplete and as a consequence, either production from, or the average reserve life of, our properties will decline. Furthermore, if oil or natural gas prices increase, our cost for additional reserves could also increase.  We may incur material costs to comply with or as a result of health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations. The oil and natural gas industry is subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to local, provincial and federal legislation. A violation of that legislation may result in the imposition of fines or the issuance of “clean up” orders. Legislation regulating the oil and natural gas industry may be changed to impose higher standards and potentially more costly obligations. Although we have recorded a provision in our financial statements relating to our estimated future environmental and reclamation obligations that we believe is reasonable, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to satisfy our actual future environmental and reclamation obligations. For wells and facilities in the Province of Alberta, the Alberta Energy Regulator (“AER”) tracks each licensee’s deemed asset value and estimated abandonment and reclamation liabilities, and imposes a security deposit on operators whose estimated liabilities exceed their deemed asset value. At September 30, 2015, the Company had sufficient deemed asset value that no security deposit was due. However, in fiscal 2016 Barnwell's Liability Management Ratio may be less than 1.0 which would necessitate a cash deposit with the AER and/or the implementation of a structured LLR Program Management Plan; the amount of the required deposit, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated. A requirement to provide security deposit funds to the AER in the future would result in the diversion of operating cash flows that could otherwise be used to fund oil and natural gas reserve replacement efforts, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, in July 2014, the AER introduced 22an Inactive Well Compliance Program which resulted in the acceleration of expenditures to suspend and/or abandon long-term inactive wells. We are not fully insured against certain environmental risks, either because such insurance is not available or because of high premium costs. In particular, insurance against risks from environmental pollution occurring over time, as opposed to sudden and catastrophic damages, is not available on economically reasonable terms. Accordingly, any site reclamation or abandonment costs actually incurred in the ordinary course of business in a specific period could negatively impact our cash flow. Should we be unable to fully fund the cost of remedying an environmental problem, we might be required to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy. We may fail to fully identify potential problems related to acquired reserves or to properly estimate those reserves. We periodically evaluate acquisitions of reserves, properties, prospects and leaseholds and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategy. Our evaluation includes an assessment of reserves, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, potential for future drilling and production, validity of the seller’s title to the properties and potential environmental issues, litigation and other liabilities. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities or title defects in excess of the amounts claimed by us before closing and acquire properties on an “as is” basis. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and future production rates and costs with respect to acquired properties, and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates. The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We compete for capital, acquisitions of reserves, undeveloped lands, skilled personnel, access to drilling rigs, service rigs and other equipment, access to processing facilities, pipeline capacity and in many other respects with a substantial number of other organizations, many of which may have greater technical and financial resources than we do. Some of these organizations explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas, carry on refining operations and market oil and other products on a worldwide basis. As a result of these complementary activities, some of our competitors may have competitive resources that are greater and more diverse than ours. Furthermore, many of our competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production, such as changing prices and production levels, the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations. If our competitors are able to capitalize on these competitive resources, it could adversely affect our revenues. 23An increase in operating costs greater than anticipated could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Higher operating costs for our properties will directly decrease the amount of cash flow received by us. Electricity, supplies, and labor costs are a few of the operating costs that are susceptible to material fluctuation. The need for significant repairs and maintenance of infrastructure may increase as our properties age. A significant increase in operating costs could result in materially lower operating margin and cash flow.Our operating results are affected by our ability to market the oil and natural gas that we produce. Our business depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of oil and natural gas gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities. Canadian federal and provincial, as well as United States federal and state, regulation of oil and natural gas production, processing and transportation, tax and energy policies, general economic conditions, and changes in supply and demand could adversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas. If market factors change and inhibit the marketing of our production, overall production or realized prices may decline. We are not the operator and have limited influence over the operations of the majority of our oil and natural gas properties. We hold minority interests in the majority of our oil and natural gas properties. As a result, we cannot control the pace of exploration or development, major decisions affecting the drilling of wells, the plan for development and production at non-operated properties, or the timing and amount of costs related to abandonment and reclamation activities although contract provisions give Barnwell certain consent rights in some matters. The operator’s influence over these matters can affect the pace at which we incur capital expenditures. Additionally, as certain underlying joint venture data is not accessible to us, we depend on the operators at non-operated properties to provide us with reliable accounting information. We also depend on operators and joint operators to maintain the financial resources to fund their share of all abandonment and reclamation costs. The inability of one or more of our working interest partners to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results.For our operated properties, we pay expenses and bill our non-operating partners for their respective shares of costs. Some of our non-operating partners may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial obligations. Nonperformance by a non-operating partner could result in significant financial losses.Liquidity problems encountered by our working interest partners or the third party operators of our non-operated properties may also result in significant financial losses as the other working interest partners or third party operators may be unwilling or unable to pay their share of the costs of projects as they become due.Actual reserves will vary from reserve estimates. Estimating reserves is inherently uncertain and the reserves estimation process involves significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The reserve data and standardized measures set forth herein are only estimates. Ultimately, actual 24reserves attributable to our properties will vary from estimates, and those variations may be material. The estimation of reserves involves a number of factors and assumptions, including, among others: •oil and natural gas prices as prescribed by SEC regulations;•historical production from our wells compared with production rates from similar producing wells in the area;•future commodity prices, production and development costs, royalties and capital expenditures;•initial production rates;•production decline rates;•ultimate recovery of reserves;•success of future development activities;•marketability of production;•effects of government regulation; and•other government levies that may be imposed over the producing life of reserves. If these factors, assumptions and prices prove to be inaccurate, actual results may vary materially from reserve estimates. Delays in business operations could adversely affect our distributions. In addition to the usual delays in payment by purchasers of oil and natural gas to the operators of our properties, and the delays of those operators in remitting payment to us, payments between any of these parties may also be delayed by: •restrictions imposed by lenders;•accounting delays;•delays in the sale or delivery of products;•delays in the connection of wells to a gathering system;•blowouts or other accidents;•adjustments for prior periods;•recovery by the operator of expenses incurred in the operation of the properties; and•the establishment by the operator of reserves for these expenses. Any of these delays could expose us to additional third party credit risks. The industry in which we operate exposes us to potential liabilities that may not be covered by insurance. Our operations are subject to all of the risks associated with the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties, including the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, and the production and transportation of oil and natural gas. These risks include encountering unexpected formations or pressures, premature declines of reservoirs, blow-outs, equipment failures and other accidents, cratering, sour gas releases, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, adverse weather conditions, pollution, other environmental risks, fires and spills. A number of these risks could result in personal injury, loss of life, or environmental and other damage to our property or the property of others. While we maintain reserves for anticipated liabilities and carry various levels of insurance, we could be affected by civil, criminal, regulatory or administrative actions, claims or proceedings. We cannot fully protect against all of the risks listed above, nor are all of these risks insurable. There is no assurance that any applicable insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability for the risks 25listed above. We could face substantial losses if an event occurs for which we are not fully insured or are not indemnified against or a customer or insurer fails to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations. In addition, there can be no assurance that insurance will continue to be available to cover any or all of these risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive. Deficiencies in operating practices and record keeping, if any, may increase our risks and liabilities relating to incidents such as spills and releases and may increase the level of regulatory enforcement actions. Our operations are subject to domestic and foreign government regulation and other risks, particularly in Canada and the United States. Barnwell’s oil and natural gas operations are affected by political developments and laws and regulations, particularly in Canada and the United States, such as restrictions on production, restrictions on imports and exports, the maintenance of specified reserves, tax increases and retroactive tax claims, expropriation of property, cancellation of contract rights, environmental protection controls, environmental compliance requirements and laws pertaining to workers’ health and safety. Further, the right to explore for and develop oil and natural gas on lands in Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia is controlled by the governments of each of those provinces. Changes in royalties and other terms of provincial leases, permits and reservations may have a substantial effect on Barnwell’s operations. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from our operations in Canada. In fiscal 2015, we derived 53% of our revenues from operations in Canada.The Alberta New Democratic Party provincial government, elected in May of 2015, has established a new Royalty Panel and a new Climate Change Advisory Panel that are proceeding with plans to study, and potentially modify, Alberta’s royalty structure and increase carbon levies. A change in the Alberta provincial royalty structure could have a significant impact on Barnwell’s future financial results, cost of capital and capital investment plans. The Royalty Panel expects to complete its review by the end of December 2015 and implement a new royalty structure by January 2017.The newly elected Federal Liberal Party of Canada government may implement new environmental legislation and regulatory oversight, which may have a significant impact on the oil and gas industry. Opposition to new or expanded pipelines may result in wider differentials between Canadian crude oil blends and North American benchmarks. Additionally, our ability to compete in the Canadian oil and natural gas industry may be adversely affected by governmental regulations or other policies that favor the awarding of contracts to contractors in which Canadian nationals have substantial ownership interests. Furthermore, we may face governmentally imposed restrictions or fees from time to time on the transfer of funds to the U.S. Government regulations control and often limit access to potential markets and impose extensive requirements concerning employee safety, environmental protection, pollution control and remediation of environmental contamination. Environmental regulations, in particular, prohibit access to some markets and make others less economical, increase equipment and personnel costs and often impose liability without regard to negligence or fault. In addition, governmental regulations may discourage our customers’ activities, reducing demand for our products and services. 26Compliance with foreign tax and other laws may adversely affect our operations.Tax and other laws and regulations are not always interpreted consistently among local, regional and national authorities. Income tax laws, other legislation or government incentive programs relating to the oil and natural gas industry may in the future be changed or interpreted in a manner that adversely affects us and our stockholders. It is also possible that in the future we will be subject to disputes concerning taxation and other matters in Canada, including the manner in which we calculate our income for tax purposes, and these disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.Unforeseen title defects may result in a loss of entitlement to production and reserves. Although we conduct title reviews in accordance with industry practice prior to any purchase of resource assets or property, such reviews do not guarantee that an unforeseen defect in the chain of title will not arise and defeat our title to the purchased assets. If such a defect were to occur, our entitlement to the production from such purchased assets could be jeopardized. Risks Related to Land Investment Segment Receipt of future percentage of sales payments is dependent upon the developer’s continued efforts to develop and market the property. We are entitled to receive future payments based on a percentage of the sales prices of residential homes and lots within approximately 870 acres in the Kaupulehu area. However, in order to collect such percentage of sales payments we are reliant upon the developer, KD I and KD II, in which we own a 19.6% ownership interest, to continue to develop and market the homes and lots. We do not have a controlling interest in the partnerships, and therefore are dependent on the general partner for development decisions. The receipt of future percentage of sales payments could be jeopardized if the developer fails to proceed with development and marketing of the property. We hold investment interests in unconsolidated land development partnerships, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, in which we do not have a controlling interest. These investments involve risks and are highly illiquid. These investments involve risks which include: •the lack of a controlling interest in these partnerships and, therefore, the inability to require that the entities sell assets, return invested capital or take any other action without obtaining the majority vote of partners;•potential for future additional capital contributions to fund operations and development activities;•the adverse impact on overall profitability if the entities do not achieve the financial results projected;•the reallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives and/or an increase in our indebtedness to pay potential future additional capital contributions, which could in turn restrict our ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of our business strategy;•undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems, unanticipated costs, and an inability to recover or manage such liabilities and costs; and27•certain underlying partnership data is not accessible to us, therefore we depend on the general partner to provide us with reliable accounting information.We may be required to write-down the carrying value of our investment in the Kukio Resort land development partnerships if our assumptions about future lot sales and profitability prove incorrect. Any write-down would negatively impact our results of operations. In analyzing the value of our investment in the Kukio Resort land development partnerships, we have made assumptions about the level of future lot sales, operating and development costs, cash generation and market conditions. These assumptions are based on management’s and the general partner’s best estimates and if the actual results differ significantly from these assumptions, we may not be able to realize the value of the assets recorded, which could lead to an impairment of certain of these assets in the future. The market value of our real estate interests could decline, which may require a write-down of the carrying value of our residential lot held for sale to its estimated fair value. Any write-down would negatively impact our results of operations. The market value of residential lots can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing economic market conditions. Economic conditions in the United States and the world have improved in recent years but the recovery remains relatively slow, which puts continued pressure on consumer confidence for residential real estate. These challenging market conditions are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and may deteriorate. Prevailing market conditions may significantly influence the market value of our residential parcel held for sale. If the market conditions deteriorate, we will be required to write-down the carrying value of our  residential parcel held for sale. Such write-down would have a negative impact on our results of operations.Our land investment business is concentrated in the state of Hawaii. As a result, our financial results are dependent on the economic growth and health of Hawaii, particularly the island of Hawaii. Barnwell’s land investment segment is impacted by the condition of Hawaii’s real estate market, which is affected by Hawaii’s economy and Hawaii’s tourism industry, as well as the United States and world economies in general. Any future cash flows from Barnwell’s land development activities are subject to, among other factors, the level of real estate activity and prices, the demand for new housing and second homes on the island of Hawaii, the rate of increase in the cost of building materials and labor, the introduction of building code modifications, changes to zoning laws, and the level of confidence in Hawaii’s economy. We may be adversely impacted by the failure of the land development partnerships to fulfill their commitments. Barnwell, as well as KD I, KD II and certain other owners of the partnerships, have jointly and severally executed a surety indemnification agreement. Bonds issued by the surety relate to certain construction contracts of KD I. If any such performance bonds are called, we may be obligated to reimburse the issuer of the performance bond as Barnwell, KD I and certain other owners are jointly and severally liable. If the partnerships do not fulfill their commitments, we may be required to expend additional resources or suffer losses, which could be significant. 28The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business.The occurrence of a natural disaster in Hawaii such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop and sell properties or realize income from our projects. The occurrence of a natural disaster could also cause property and flood insurance rates and deductibles to increase, which could reduce demand for our properties.Our business is subject to extensive regulation which makes it difficult and expensive for us to conduct our operations. We are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to land use and development and to environmental compliance and permitting obligations, including those related to the use, storage, discharge, emission, and disposal of hazardous materials. In most cases, approval to develop requires multiple permits which involve a long, uncertain and costly regulatory process. Any failure to comply with these laws could result in capital or operating expenditures or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations that could adversely affect present and future operations, or jeopardize our ability to sell the leasehold interest currently held. If required land use entitlements are not obtained at reasonable costs, or at all, our operating results could be adversely affected. We hold the leasehold interest to approximately 1,000 acres of vacant land that is currently zoned conservation. Our success in selling this interest may be contingent upon obtaining the necessary reclassification from the State of Hawaii Land Use Commission and county of Hawaii. Obtaining the necessary reclassification and ministerial approvals is often difficult, costly and may take several years, or more, to complete. Delays or failures to obtain the necessary reclassification approvals may adversely affect our financial results. Risks Related to Contract Drilling Segment Demand for water well drilling and/or pump installation is volatile. A decrease in demand for our services could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. Demand for services is highly dependent upon land development activities in the state of Hawaii. As also noted above, the real estate development industry is cyclical in nature and is particularly vulnerable to shifts in local, regional, and national economic conditions outside of our control such as interest rates, housing demand, population growth, employment levels and job growth and property taxes. A decrease in water well drilling and/or pump installation contracts will result in decreased revenues and operating results. A significant portion of our contract drilling business is dependent on municipalities and a decline in municipal spending could adversely impact our business. A significant portion of our contract drilling division revenues is derived from water and infrastructure contracts with governmental entities or agencies. Reduced tax revenues and governmental budgets may limit spending by local governments which in turn will affect the demand for our services. Material reductions in spending by a significant number of local governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial position. 29Our contract drilling operations face significant competition. We face competition for our services from a variety of competitors. Many of our competitors utilize drilling rigs that drill as quickly as our equipment but require less labor. Our strategy is to compete based on pricing and to a lesser degree, quality of service. If we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors, our financial results could be adversely affected.The loss of or damage to key vendor, customer or sub-contractor relationships would adversely affect our operations. Our contract drilling business is dependent on our relationships with key vendors, customers and subcontractors. The loss of or damage to any of our key relationships could negatively affect our business. Awarding of contracts is dependent upon our ability to obtain contract bid and performance bonds from insurers. There can be no assurance that our ability to obtain such bonds will continue on the same basis as the past. Additionally, bonding insurance rates may increase and have an impact on our ability to win competitive bids, which could have a corresponding material impact on contract drilling operating results. The contracts in our backlog are subject to change orders and cancellation. Our backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under contracts that have been started and new contracts not yet started. Our contracts are subject to change orders and cancellations, and such changes could adversely affect our operations. The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business. The occurrence of a natural disaster in Hawaii such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete our contracts. Risks Related to Residential Real Estate Segment The market value of our real estate interests could decline, which may require additional write-downs of the carrying value of our real estate held for sale to its estimated fair value. Any write-downs would negatively impact our results of operations. Economic conditions in the United States and the world have improved in recent years but the recovery remains slow, which puts continued pressure on consumer confidence for residential real estate. These challenging market conditions are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and these conditions may deteriorate. Prevailing market conditions significantly influence the market value of our real estate held for sale. If the market conditions deteriorate, we will be required to write-down the carrying value of our real estate held for sale. Such write-downs would have a negative impact on our results of operations. 30We are reliant upon the sale of our home as a source of liquidity. If we are unable to sell the home within a reasonable timeframe, our operating results, cash inflows and financial condition could be materially impacted.Barnwell currently owns one luxury residence that is available for sale in the Lot 4A Increment I area of Kaupulehu, North Kona, Hawaii. Any unpaid principal balance and accrued interest on our real estate loan is due and payable on April 1, 2018. Upon the sale of the house or the residential parcel, we will be required to make a principal payment in the amount of the net sales proceeds of the house or residential parcel. Absent the sale of the house or the ability to refinance, the balloon payment on the debt will need to be repaid using other operating cash flows which could negatively impact other business segments. The inability to sell the home within a reasonable timeframe will lead to additional interest, maintenance, property taxes and other holding costs. Furthermore, if estimated cash inflows from the home sale is less than current expectations, our operating results, cash inflows and financial condition could be materially impacted. Severe weather and other natural conditions or disasters may impair the value of our real estate property. Severe weather and other natural conditions or disasters, such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts, floods, and heavy or prolonged rain, can negatively affect our operations by requiring us to perform potentially costly repairs to our projects. Further, these conditions can delay home closings, adversely affect the cost or availability of materials or labor, or impair the value of the property on a temporary or permanent basis. To the extent our insurance is not adequate to cover business interruption losses or repair costs resulting from these events, our total earned revenues and earnings may be adversely affected"
1,BRN,BARNWELL INDUSTRIES,2014-12-18,"ITEM 1A.                         RISK FACTORS The business of Barnwell and its subsidiaries face numerous risks, including those set forth below or those described elsewhere in this Form 10-K or in Barnwells other filings with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only risks that Barnwell faces. If any of the following risk factors should occur, our profitability, financial condition or liquidity could be materially negatively impacted. Entity-Wide RisksFuture economic conditions and volatility in prices for natural gas and oil may have impacts on our business and financial condition that we currently cannot predict.Modest and unsteady economic growth from the global financial crisis and recession that began in 2008 continues to affect the demand for luxury real estate and water well drilling and pump installation services in Hawaii. Additionally, the discovery and availability of natural gas and more recently oil from shale has resulted in an oversupply of natural gas and oil in North America contributing to a decline in prices as compared to years past. Absent a sufficient increase in natural gas and/or oil prices, it is unlikely that future oil and natural gas operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund the capital expenditure levels necessary to maintain current production and reserve levels over the long term in the absence of favorable offsetting factors or cash inflows from other sources. If Barnwells cash flow from operations is not sufficient to satisfy its capital expenditure requirements, there can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available to meet these requirements or available on terms acceptable to the Company. Inability to access sufficient capital and credit, in combination with insufficient operating cash flows and land investment sales proceeds, will result in continuing decreases in oil and natural gas reserves that in turn will result in a decline in cash flows from oil and natural gas production to amounts that are insufficient to cover ongoing expenses and debt service requirements. Our future level of indebtedness and the terms of our financing arrangements may adversely affect our operations, financial condition and limit our growth.At September 30, 2014, we had borrowings under our credit facility and real estate loan of approximately $11.1 million. In the ordinary course of business, we may incur significant additional debt in order to fund future capital expenditures, acquisitions and homebuilding activities. 17Table of Contents The terms of our credit facility and real estate loan impose restrictions on our ability and, in some cases, the ability of our subsidiaries to take a number of actions that we may otherwise desire to take, including one or more of the following: · incurring additional debt, including guarantees of indebtedness;  · making investments;  · creating liens on our assets; and  · selling assets.    Our level of indebtedness and the covenants contained in our financing agreements could have important consequences. For example, they could: · limit   our ability to obtain future financing, through equity offerings or debt   financings, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions,   refinancing of indebtedness or general corporate and other activities;  · require   us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to   service our debt, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow for other   purposes (i.e., working capital, capital expenditures, and other general   business activities);  · limit   our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, the changes in our business;  · subject   us to higher costs and more restrictive covenants in the future for working   capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other   purposes, if additional financing is obtained;  · make   us vulnerable to increases in interest rates as our credit facilities are   subject to variable interest rates;  · detract   from our ability to successfully withstand a downturn in our business or the   economy generally;  · place   us at a competitive disadvantage because we have more debt than some of our   competitors; and  · make   us more vulnerable to general economic downturns and adverse developments in   our industries, especially declines in oil and natural gas prices, and the   economy in general.    We may incur additional debt, including significant secured indebtedness, or issue additional stock in order to fund capital expenditures, make future acquisitions, and develop our properties. A higher level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our obligations. Our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance. General economic conditions, oil and natural gas prices and financial, business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control. Factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through a refinancing of our debt include financial market conditions, the value of our assets and our performance at the time we need capital. In addition, our Canadian revolving credit facility is subject to periodic redetermination and renewal. In April 2014, the aggregate principal amount of the revolving credit facility was decreased from $20,000,000 Canadian dollars to $11,800,000 Canadian dollars, partially due to the decrease in security resulting from sales of oil and natural gas properties in fiscal 2014. A further decrease in the facility could require us to repay indebtedness in excess of the borrowing base, or we may need to further secure the lenders with additional collateral. If we do not have sufficient funds for repayment, available assets for collateral or the ability to arrange new financing, we may have to sell significant assets. Any such sale could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. 18Table of Contents Furthermore, our real estate loan agreement contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with a consolidated debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.20 to 1 and a consolidated total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio not to exceed 1.85 to 1. Noncompliance with either of these ratios could result in the need to pay down all or a portion of the outstanding borrowings before the scheduled due date. The price of our common stock has been volatile and could continue to fluctuate substantially. The market price of our common stock has been volatile and could fluctuate based on a variety of factors, including: ·                 fluctuations in commodity prices;·                 variations in results of operations;·                 announcements by us and our competitors;·                 legislative or regulatory changes;·                 general trends in the industry;·                 general market conditions; and·                 analysts estimates and other events in the oil and natural gas industry. Our operations are subject to currency rate fluctuations. Our operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar. Our financial statements, presented in U.S. dollars, may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk. Volatility in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations, particularly through the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar which may affect the relative prices at which we sell our oil and natural gas and may affect the cost of certain items required in our operations. To date, we have not entered into foreign currency hedging transactions to control or minimize these risks. Failure to retain key personnel could hurt our operations. We require highly skilled and experienced personnel to operate our business. In addition to competing in highly competitive industries, we compete in a highly competitive labor market. Our business could be adversely affected by an inability to retain personnel or upward pressure on wages as a result of the highly competitive labor market. A small number of stockholders, including our executive officers, own a significant amount of our common stock and have influence over our business regardless of the opposition of other stockholders. As of September 30, 2014, four of our stockholders, including two of our executive officers, held approximately 44% of our outstanding common stock. The interests of one or more of these stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders. These stockholders have significant influence over all matters submitted to our stockholders, including the election of our directors, and could accelerate, delay, deter or prevent a change of control of the Company. The significant stockholders who also are executive officers could significantly affect our business, policies and affairs. 19Table of Contents Adverse changes in actuarial assumptions used to calculate retirement plan costs due to economic or other factors, or lower returns on plan assets could adversely affect Barnwells results and financial condition. Retirement plan cash funding obligations and plan expenses and obligations are subject to a high degree of uncertainty and could increase in future years depending on numerous factors, including the performance of the financial markets, specifically the equity markets, and the levels of interest rates. Risks Related to Oil and Natural Gas Segment Successful re-investment of proceeds from the sale of oil and natural gas properties is needed in order to replace production and reserves of the properties sold. It is uncertain whether future acquisition and development activities will result in additional proved reserves or that we will be able to drill productive wells at acceptable costs. Future oil and gas production is, therefore, highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves on an economic basis. Furthermore, if oil or natural gas prices increase, our cost for additional reserves could also increase. The amount of funding available for investment activities is also uncertain. We may fail to fully identify potential problems related to acquired reserves or to properly estimate those reserves. We periodically evaluate acquisitions of reserves, properties, prospects and leaseholds and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategy. Our evaluation includes an assessment of reserves, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, potential for future drilling and production, validity of the sellers title to the properties and potential environmental issues, litigation and other liabilities. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities or title defects in excess of the amounts claimed by us before closing and acquire properties on an as is basis. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and future production rates and costs with respect to acquired properties, and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates. The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We compete for capital, acquisitions of reserves, undeveloped lands, skilled personnel, access to drilling rigs, service rigs and other equipment, access to processing facilities, pipeline capacity and in many other respects with a substantial number of other organizations, many of which may have greater technical and financial resources than we do. Some of these organizations explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas, carry on refining operations and market oil and other products on a  20Table of Contents worldwide basis. As a result of these complementary activities, some of our competitors may have competitive resources that are greater and more diverse than ours. Furthermore, many of our competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production, such as changing prices and production levels, the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations. If our competitors are able to capitalize on these competitive resources, it could adversely affect our revenues. Oil and natural gas prices are volatile. Our results of operations and financial condition are highly dependent on the prices of and demand for our oil and natural gas production. Oil and natural gas prices are volatile and have fluctuated widely during recent years in response to many factors that are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty, weather, worldwide political instability, foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the level of consumer product demand, government regulations and taxes, the price and availability of alternative fuels and the overall economic environment. Any decline in oil or natural gas prices may have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, operating cash flows, borrowing ability, reserves, and the amount of capital that we are able to allocate for the development of oil and natural gas reserves and future growth. Energy prices are also subject to other political and regulatory actions outside our control, which may include changes in the policies of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries or other developments involving or affecting oil-producing countries, or actions or reactions of the government of the United States in anticipation of or in response to such developments. Additionally, we follow the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our oil and natural gas properties. Under this method, the net book value of properties less related deferred income taxes, may not exceed a calculated ceiling, which is based upon the estimated after tax discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas properties. The excess, if any, of the net book value above the ceiling is required to be written off as an expense. See Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates for further details. A sufficient decline in oil or natural gas prices or other factors, without other mitigating circumstances, could result in future reductions of the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties and an equivalent charge to earnings. An increase in operating costs or a decline in our production level greater than anticipated could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Higher operating costs for our properties will directly decrease the amount of cash flow received by us. Electricity, supplies, and labor costs are a few of the operating costs that are susceptible to material fluctuation. The need for significant repairs and maintenance of infrastructure may increase as our properties age. A significant increase in operating costs could result in materially lower operating margin and cash flow. The level of production from our existing properties may decline at rates greater than anticipated due to unforeseen circumstances, many of which are beyond our control. A significant decline in our production could result in materially lower revenues and cash flow. 21Table of Contents Our operating results are affected by our ability to market the oil and natural gas that we produce. Our business depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of oil and natural gas gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities. Canadian federal and provincial, as well as United States federal and state, regulation of oil and natural gas production, processing and transportation, tax and energy policies, general economic conditions, and changes in supply and demand could adversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas. If market factors change and inhibit the marketing of our production, overall production or realized prices may decline. We are not the operator and have limited influence over the operations of the majority of our oil and natural gas properties. We hold minority interests in the majority of our oil and natural gas properties. As a result, we cannot control the pace of exploration or development, major decisions affecting the drilling of wells or the plan for development and production at non-operated properties, although contract provisions give Barnwell certain consent rights in some matters. The operators influence over these matters can affect the pace at which we incur capital expenditures. Additionally, as certain underlying joint venture data is not accessible to us, we depend on the operators at non-operated properties to provide us with reliable accounting information. We also depend on operators and joint operators to maintain the financial resources to fund their share of all abandonment and reclamation costs. We are dependent upon future discoveries or acquisitions of oil and natural gas to maintain our reserves. We actively explore for oil and natural gas reserves. However, future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and may involve substantial costs. Despite this uncertainty or potential cost, discoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production. As a result, future oil and natural gas reserves may be dependent on our success in exploiting existing properties and acquiring additional reserves. If our access to capital becomes limited or unavailable, our ability to make the necessary capital investments to maintain or expand our oil and natural gas reserves will be impaired. Additionally, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in developing additional reserves or acquiring additional reserves on terms that meet our investment objectives. Without these reserve additions, our reserves will deplete and as a consequence, either production from, or the average reserve life of, our properties will decline. Future oil and natural gas segment taxable income could vary significantly from estimates, which could in turn result in the inability to realize a portion or all of our deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance has been provided. Our deferred tax assets include liabilities accrued for books but not for tax under Canadian tax law. Our ability to realize these deferred tax assets is based upon the assumption of continuing oil and gas drilling and acquisition activity in the future and continuity of the oil and natural gas segment as a going concern in Canada. If new operational strategies and estimates of oil and natural gas drilling and reserve acquisition success do not materialize as planned, or if negative evidence of future realizability cannot be overcome despite our plans and estimates, some or all of these deferred tax assets would not be deemed realizable, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 22Table of Contents Actual reserves will vary from reserve estimates. Estimating reserves is inherently uncertain and the reserves estimation process involves significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The reserve data and standardized measures set forth herein are only estimates. Ultimately, actual reserves attributable to our properties will vary from estimates, and those variations may be material. The estimation of reserves involves a number of factors and assumptions, including, among others: ·                 oil and natural gas prices as prescribed by SEC regulations;·                 historical production from our wells compared with production rates from similar producing wells in the area;·                 future commodity prices, production and development costs, royalties and capital expenditures;·                 initial production rates;·                 production decline rates;·                 ultimate recovery of reserves;·                 success of future development activities;·                 marketability of production;·                 effects of government regulation; and·                 other government levies that may be imposed over the producing life of reserves. If these factors, assumptions and prices prove to be inaccurate, actual results may vary materially from reserve estimates. Delays in business operations could adversely affect our distributions. In addition to the usual delays in payment by purchasers of oil and natural gas to the operators of our properties, and the delays of those operators in remitting payment to us, payments between any of these parties may also be delayed by: ·                 restrictions imposed by lenders;·                 accounting delays;·                 delays in the sale or delivery of products;·                 delays in the connection of wells to a gathering system;·                 blowouts or other accidents;·                 adjustments for prior periods;·                 recovery by the operator of expenses incurred in the operation of the properties; and·                 the establishment by the operator of reserves for these expenses. Any of these delays could expose us to additional third party credit risks. The industry in which we operate exposes us to potential liabilities that may not be covered by insurance. Our operations are subject to all of the risks associated with the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties, including the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, and the production and transportation of oil and natural gas. These risks include encountering unexpected formations or pressures, premature declines of reservoirs, blow-outs, equipment failures and other accidents,  23Table of Contents cratering, sour gas releases, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, adverse weather conditions, pollution, other environmental risks, fires and spills. A number of these risks could result in personal injury, loss of life, or environmental and other damage to our property or the property of others. While we maintain reserves for anticipated liabilities and carry various levels of insurance, we could be affected by civil, criminal, regulatory or administrative actions, claims or proceedings. We cannot fully protect against all of the risks listed above, nor are all of these risks insurable. There is no assurance that any applicable insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability for the risks listed above. We could face substantial losses if an event occurs for which we are not fully insured or are not indemnified against or a customer or insurer fails to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations. In addition, there can be no assurance that insurance will continue to be available to cover any or all of these risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive. Deficiencies in operating practices and record keeping, if any, may increase our risks and liabilities relating to incidents such as spills and releases and may increase the level of regulatory enforcement actions. We may incur material costs to comply with or as a result of health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations. The oil and natural gas industry is subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to local, provincial and federal legislation. A violation of that legislation may result in the imposition of fines or the issuance of clean up orders. Legislation regulating the oil and natural gas industry may be changed to impose higher standards and potentially more costly obligations. Although we have recorded a provision in our financial statements relating to our estimated future environmental and reclamation obligations that we believe is reasonable, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to satisfy our actual future environmental and reclamation obligations. For wells and facilities in the Province of Alberta, the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) tracks each licensees deemed asset value and estimated abandonment and reclamation liabilities, and imposes a security deposit on operators whose estimated liabilities exceed their deemed asset value. At September 30, 2014, the Company had sufficient deemed asset value that no security deposit was due. A requirement to provide security deposit funds to the AER in the future would result in the diversion of operating cash flows that could otherwise be used to fund oil and natural gas reserve replacement efforts, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, in July 2014, the AER introduced an Inactive Well Compliance Program which will result in the acceleration of expenditures to suspend and/or abandon long-term inactive wells. We are not fully insured against certain environmental risks, either because such insurance is not available or because of high premium costs. In particular, insurance against risks from environmental pollution occurring over time, as opposed to sudden and catastrophic damages, is not available on economically reasonable terms. Accordingly, any site reclamation or abandonment costs actually incurred in the ordinary course of business in a specific period could negatively impact our cash flow. Should we be unable to fully fund the cost of remedying an environmental problem, we might be required to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy. 24Table of Contents We may have difficulty funding our planned capital expenditures, which could have an adverse effect on our business. We make and expect to continue to make capital expenditures in our exploration and development projects. Without adequate capital resources, our drilling and other activities may be limited and our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer. We may not be able to generate sufficient operating cash flows or secure necessary financing on reasonable terms or at all and financing may not continue to be available to us under our existing financing arrangements. If capital resources are unavailable, we may be forced to curtail our drilling, development and other activities or be forced to sell some of our assets under untimely or unfavorable terms. Any such curtailment or sale could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our operations are subject to domestic and foreign government regulation and other risks, particularly in Canada and the United States. Barnwells oil and natural gas operations are affected by political developments and laws and regulations, particularly in Canada and the United States, such as restrictions on production, restrictions on imports and exports, the maintenance of specified reserves, tax increases and retroactive tax claims, expropriation of property, cancellation of contract rights, environmental protection controls, environmental compliance requirements and laws pertaining to workers health and safety. Further, the right to explore for and develop oil and natural gas on lands in Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia is controlled by the governments of each of those provinces. Changes in royalties and other terms of provincial leases, permits and reservations may have a substantial effect on Barnwells operations. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from our operations in Canada. In fiscal 2014, we derived 75% of our revenues from operations in Canada. Additionally, our ability to compete in the Canadian oil and natural gas industry may be adversely affected by governmental regulations or other policies that favor the awarding of contracts to contractors in which Canadian nationals have substantial ownership interests. Furthermore, we may face governmentally imposed restrictions or fees from time to time on the transfer of funds to the U.S. Government regulations control and often limit access to potential markets and impose extensive requirements concerning employee safety, environmental protection, pollution control and remediation of environmental contamination. Environmental regulations, in particular, prohibit access to some markets and make others less economical, increase equipment and personnel costs and often impose liability without regard to negligence or fault. In addition, governmental regulations may discourage our customers activities, reducing demand for our products and services. Compliance with foreign tax and other laws may adversely affect our operations. Tax and other laws and regulations are not always interpreted consistently among local, regional and national authorities. Income tax laws, other legislation or government incentive programs relating to the oil and natural gas industry may in the future be changed or interpreted in a manner that adversely affects us and our stockholders. It is also possible that in the future we will be subject to disputes concerning taxation and other matters in Canada, including the manner in which we calculate our income for tax purposes, and these disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. 25Table of Contents Unforeseen title defects may result in a loss of entitlement to production and reserves. Although we conduct title reviews in accordance with industry practice prior to any purchase of resource assets or property, such reviews do not guarantee that an unforeseen defect in the chain of title will not arise and defeat our title to the purchased assets. If such a defect were to occur, our entitlement to the production from such purchased assets could be jeopardized. Risks Related to Land Investment Segment The market value of our real estate interests could decline, which may require write-downs of the carrying value of our residential lot held for investment to its estimated fair value. Any write-downs would negatively impact our results of operations. The market value of residential lots can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing economic market conditions. Economic conditions in the United States and the world have improved in recent years but the recovery remains relatively weak, which puts continued pressure on consumer confidence for residential real estate. These challenging market conditions are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and may deteriorate. Prevailing market conditions may significantly influence the market value of our residential parcel held for investment. In the event of changes in economic or market conditions, we may have to sell the residential lot at a lower margin or at a loss, or we may be required to write-down the carrying value of our residential parcel held for investment. Such write-down would have a negative impact on our results of operations. We hold investment interests in unconsolidated land development partnerships, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, in which we do not have a controlling interest. These investments involve risks and are highly illiquid. These investments involve risks which include: · the   lack of a controlling interest in these partnerships and, therefore, the   inability to require that the entities sell assets, return invested capital   or take any other action without obtaining the majority vote of partners;  · potential   for future additional capital contributions to fund operations and   development activities;  · the   adverse impact on overall profitability if the entities do not achieve the   financial results projected;  · the   reallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives and/or an   increase in our indebtedness to pay potential future additional capital   contributions, which could in turn restrict our ability to access additional   capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of our business   strategy;  · undisclosed,   contingent or other liabilities or problems, unanticipated costs, and an   inability to recover or manage such liabilities and costs; and  · certain   underlying partnership data is not accessible to us, therefore we depend on   the general partner to provide us with reliable accounting information.    26Table of Contents We may be required to write-down the carrying value of our investment in land development partnerships if our assumptions about future lot sales and profitability prove incorrect. In analyzing the value of our investment in land development partnerships, we have made assumptions about the level of future lot sales, operating and development costs, cash generation and market conditions. These assumptions are based on managements and the general partners best estimates and if the actual results differ significantly from these assumptions, we may not be able to realize the value of the assets recorded, which could lead to an impairment of certain of these assets in the future. Our land investment business is concentrated in the state of Hawaii. As a result, our financial results are dependent on the economic growth and health of Hawaii, particularly the island of Hawaii. Barnwells land investment segment is impacted by the condition of Hawaiis real estate market, which is affected by Hawaiis economy and Hawaiis tourism industry, as well as the United States and world economies in general. Any future cash flows from Barnwells land development activities are subject to, among other factors, the level of real estate activity and prices, the demand for new housing and second homes on the island of Hawaii, the rate of increase in the cost of building materials and labor, the introduction of building code modifications, changes to zoning laws, and the level of confidence in Hawaiis economy. Receipt of future percentage of sales payments is dependent upon the developers continued efforts to develop and market the property. We are entitled to receive future payments based on a percentage of the sales prices of residential homes and lots within approximately 870 acres in the Kaupulehu area. However, in order to collect such percentage of sales payments we are reliant upon the developer, KD I and KD II, in which we own a 19.6% ownership interest, to continue to develop and market the homes and lots. We do not have a controlling interest in the partnerships, and therefore are dependent on the general partner for development decisions. The receipt of future percentage of sales payments could be jeopardized if the developer fails to proceed with development and marketing of the property. We may be adversely impacted by the failure of the land development partnerships to fulfill their commitments. Barnwell, as well as KD I, KD II and certain other owners of the partnerships, have jointly and severally executed a surety indemnification agreement. Bonds issued by the surety relate to certain construction contracts of KD I and KD II. If any such performance bonds are called, we may be obligated to reimburse the issuer of the performance bond as Barnwell, KD I, KD II and certain other owners are jointly and severally liable. If the partnerships do not fulfill their commitments, we may be required to expend additional resources or suffer losses, which could be significant. The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business. The occurrence of a natural disaster in Hawaii such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop and sell properties or realize income from our projects. The occurrence of a natural disaster could also cause property and flood insurance rates and deductibles to increase, which could reduce demand for our properties. 27Table of Contents Our business is subject to extensive regulation which makes it difficult and expensive for us to conduct our operations. We are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to land use and development and to environmental compliance and permitting obligations, including those related to the use, storage, discharge, emission, and disposal of hazardous materials. In most cases, approval to develop requires multiple permits which involve a long, uncertain and costly regulatory process. Any failure to comply with these laws could result in capital or operating expenditures or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations that could adversely affect present and future operations, or jeopardize our ability to sell the leasehold interest currently held. If required land use entitlements are not obtained at reasonable costs, or at all, our operating results could be adversely affected. We hold the leasehold interest to approximately 1,000 acres of vacant land that is currently zoned conservation. Our success in selling this interest may be contingent upon obtaining the necessary reclassification from the State of Hawaii Land Use Commission and county of Hawaii. Obtaining the necessary reclassification and ministerial approvals is often difficult, costly and may take several years, or more, to complete. Delays or failures to obtain the necessary reclassification approvals may adversely affect our financial results. Risks Related to Contract Drilling Segment Demand for water well drilling and/or pump installation is volatile. A decrease in demand for our services could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. Demand for services is highly dependent upon land development activities in the state of Hawaii. As also noted above, the real estate development industry is cyclical in nature and is particularly vulnerable to shifts in local, regional, and national economic conditions outside of our control such as interest rates, housing demand, population growth, employment levels and job growth and property taxes. A decrease in water well drilling and/or pump installation contracts will result in decreased revenues and operating results. A significant portion of our contract drilling business is dependent on municipalities and a decline in municipal spending could adversely impact our business. A significant portion of our contract drilling division revenues is derived from water and infrastructure contracts with governmental entities or agencies. Reduced tax revenues and governmental budgets may limit spending by local governments which in turn will affect the demand for our services. Material reductions in spending by a significant number of local governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial position. Our contract drilling operations face significant competition. We face competition for our services from a variety of competitors. Many of our competitors utilize drilling rigs that drill as quickly as our equipment but require less labor. Our strategy is to compete based on pricing and to a lesser degree, quality of service. If we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors, our financial results could be adversely affected. 28Table of Contents The loss of or damage to key vendor, customer or sub-contractor relationships would adversely affect our operations. Our contract drilling business is dependent on our relationships with key vendors, customers and subcontractors. The loss of or damage to any of our key relationships could negatively affect our business. Awarding of contracts is dependent upon our ability to obtain contract bid and performance bonds from insurers. There can be no assurance that our ability to obtain such bonds will continue on the same basis as the past. Additionally, bonding insurance rates may increase and have an impact on our ability to win competitive bids, which could have a corresponding material impact on contract drilling operating results. The contracts in our backlog are subject to change orders and cancellation. Our backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under contracts that have been started and new contracts not yet started. Our contracts are subject to change orders and cancellations, and such changes could adversely affect our operations. The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business. The occurrence of a natural disaster in Hawaii such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete our contracts. Risks Related to Residential Real Estate Segment The market value of our real estate interests could decline, which may require write-downs of the carrying value of our real estate held for sale to its estimated fair value. Any write-downs would negatively impact our results of operations. Economic conditions in the United States and the world have improved in recent years but the recovery remains weak, which puts continued pressure on consumer confidence for residential real estate. These challenging market conditions are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and these conditions may deteriorate. Prevailing market conditions significantly influence the market value of our real estate held for sale. If the market conditions deteriorate, we will be required to write-down the carrying value of our real estate held for sale. Such write-downs would have a negative impact on our results of operations. We are reliant upon the sale of our home as a source of liquidity. If we are unable to sell the home within a reasonable timeframe, our operating results, cash inflows and financial condition could be materially impacted. Barnwell currently owns one luxury residence that is available for sale in the Lot 4A Increment I area of Kaupulehu, North Kona, Hawaii. Any unpaid principal balance and accrued interest on our real estate loan is due and payable on April 1, 2018. Monthly payments of principal and interest on the related real estate loan are due on the first day of each month and will change as a result of a change in the interest rate, the sale of the house or the sale of a residential parcel. Upon the sale of the house or a residential parcel, we will be required  29Table of Contents to make a principal payment in the amount of the net sales proceeds of the house or residential parcel. Absent the sale of the house or the ability to refinance, the balloon payment on the debt will need to be repaid using other operating cash flows which could negatively impact other business segments. The inability to sell the home within a reasonable timeframe will lead to additional interest, maintenance, property taxes and other holding costs. Furthermore, if estimated cash inflows from the home sale is less than current expectations, our operating results, cash inflows and financial condition could be materially impacted. Severe weather and other natural conditions or disasters may impair the value of our real estate property. Severe weather and other natural conditions or disasters, such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts, floods, and heavy or prolonged rain, can negatively affect our operations by requiring us to perform potentially costly repairs to our projects. Further, these conditions can delay home closings, adversely affect the cost or availability of materials or labor, or impair the value of the property on a temporary or permanent basis. To the extent our insurance is not adequate to cover business interruption losses or repair costs resulting from these events, our total earned revenues and earnings may be adversely affected. "
14,BRN,BARNWELL INDUSTRIES,2013-12-16,"ITEM 1A.                         RISK FACTORS The business of Barnwell and its subsidiaries face numerous risks, including those set forth below or those described elsewhere in this Form 10-K or in Barnwells other filings with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only risks that Barnwell faces. If any of the following risk factors should occur, our profitability, financial condition or liquidity could be materially impacted. Entity-Wide Risks The continued economic slowdown and depressed prices for natural gas may have impacts on our business and financial condition that we currently cannot predict. The economic slowdown has affected demand for oil and natural gas, luxury real estate, and water well drilling and pump installation services. Additionally, the discovery and availability of natural gas from shale has resulted in an oversupply of natural gas in North America. Absent a sufficient increase in natural gas and/or oil prices, it is unlikely that future oil and natural gas operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund the capital expenditure levels necessary to maintain current production and reserve levels. If Barnwells cash flow from operations is not sufficient to satisfy its capital expenditure requirements, there can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available to meet these requirements or available on terms acceptable to the Company. Inability to access sufficient capital and credit, in combination with insufficient operating cash flows and land investment sales proceeds, will result in continuing decreases in oil and natural gas reserves that in turn will result in a decline in cash flows from oil and natural gas production to amounts that are insufficient to cover ongoing expenses and debt service requirements. 16Table of Contents Our future level of indebtedness and the terms of our financing arrangements may adversely affect our operations, financial condition and limit our growth. At September 30, 2013, we had borrowings under our credit facility and real estate loan of approximately $16.6 million. In the ordinary course of business, we may incur significant additional debt in order to fund future capital expenditures, acquisitions and homebuilding activities. The terms of our credit facility and real estate loan impose restrictions on our ability and, in some cases, the ability of our subsidiaries to take a number of actions that we may otherwise desire to take, including one or more of the following: ·                 incurring additional debt, including guarantees of indebtedness;·                 making investments;·                 creating liens on our assets; and·                 selling assets. Our level of indebtedness and the covenants contained in our financing agreements could have important consequences. For example, they could: ·                 limit our ability to obtain future financing, through equity offerings or debt financings, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, refinancing of indebtedness or general corporate and other activities;·                 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow for other purposes (i.e., working capital, capital expenditures, and other general business activities);·                 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, the changes in our business;·                 subject us to higher costs and more restrictive covenants in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes, if additional financing is obtained;·                 make us vulnerable to increases in interest rates as our credit facilities are subject to variable interest rates;·                 detract from our ability to successfully withstand a downturn in our business or the economy generally;·                 place us at a competitive disadvantage because we have more debt than some of our competitors; and·                 make us more vulnerable to general economic downturns and adverse developments in our industries, especially declines in oil and natural gas prices, and the economy in general. We may incur additional debt, including significant secured indebtedness, or issue additional stock in order to fund capital expenditures, make future acquisitions, and develop our properties. A higher level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our obligations. Our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance. General economic conditions, oil and natural gas prices and financial, business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control. Factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through a refinancing of our debt include financial market conditions, the value of our assets and our performance at the time we need capital. 17Table of Contents In addition, our Canadian revolving credit facility is subject to periodic redetermination. A decrease in the facility could require us to repay indebtedness in excess of the borrowing base, or we may need to further secure the lenders with additional collateral. Furthermore, our real estate loan agreement contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with a consolidated debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.20 to 1 and a consolidated total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio not to exceed 1.85 to 1. Noncompliance with any of the ratios could result in the need to pay down all or a portion of the outstanding borrowings before their scheduled due dates. The price of our common stock has been volatile and could continue to fluctuate substantially. The market price of our common stock has been volatile and could fluctuate based on a variety of factors, including: ·                 fluctuations in commodity prices;·                 variations in results of operations;·                 announcements by us and our competitors;·                 legislative or regulatory changes;·                 general trends in the industry;·                 general market conditions; and·                 analysts estimates and other events in the oil and natural gas industry. Failure to retain key personnel could hurt our operations. We require highly skilled and experienced personnel to operate our business. In addition to competing in highly competitive industries, we compete in a highly competitive labor market. Our business could be adversely affected by an inability to retain personnel or upward pressure on wages as a result of the highly competitive labor market. A small number of stockholders, including our executive officers, own a significant amount of our common stock and have influence over our business regardless of the opposition of other stockholders. As of September 30, 2013, four of our stockholders, including two of our executive officers, held approximately 44% of our outstanding common stock. The interests of one or more of these stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders. These stockholders have significant influence over all matters submitted to our stockholders, including the election of our directors, and could accelerate, delay, deter or prevent a change of control of the Company. The significant stockholders who also are executive officers could significantly affect our business, policies and affairs. Adverse changes in actuarial assumptions used to calculate retirement plan costs due to economic or other factors, or lower returns on plan assets could adversely affect Barnwells results and financial condition. Retirement plan cash funding obligations and plan expenses and obligations are subject to a high degree of uncertainty and could increase in future years depending on numerous factors, including the performance of the financial markets, specifically the equity markets, and the levels of interest rates. 18Table of Contents We are involved as a passive minority-interest partner in joint ventures and are subject to risks associated with joint venture partnerships. We are involved as a passive minority-interest partner in joint venture relationships and may initiate future joint venture projects. Entering into a joint venture as a passive minority-interest partner involves certain risks which include: ·                 the need to contribute funds to the joint venture to support its operating and capital needs;·                 the inability to exercise voting control over the joint venture;·                 economic or business interests which are not aligned with our venture partners, including the holding period and timing of ultimate sale of the ventures underlying assets; and·                 the inability for the venture partner to fulfill its commitments and obligations due to financial or other difficulties. Risks Related to Oil and Natural Gas Segment The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We compete for capital, acquisitions of reserves, undeveloped lands, skilled personnel, access to drilling rigs, service rigs and other equipment, access to processing facilities, pipeline capacity and in many other respects with a substantial number of other organizations, many of which may have greater technical and financial resources than we do. Some of these organizations explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas, carry on refining operations and market oil and other products on a worldwide basis. As a result of these complementary activities, some of our competitors may have competitive resources that are greater and more diverse than ours. Furthermore, many of our competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production, such as changing prices and production levels, the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations. If our competitors are able to capitalize on these competitive resources, it could adversely affect our revenues. Oil and natural gas prices are volatile. Our results of operations and financial condition are highly dependent on the prices of and demand for our oil and natural gas production. Oil and natural gas prices are volatile and have fluctuated widely during recent years in response to many factors that are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty, weather, worldwide political instability, foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the level of consumer product demand, government regulations and taxes, the price and availability of alternative fuels and the overall economic environment. Any decline in oil or natural gas prices may have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, operating cash flows, borrowing ability, reserves, and the amount of capital that we are able to allocate for the development of oil and natural gas reserves and future growth. Energy prices are also subject to other political and regulatory actions outside our control, which may include changes in the policies of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries or other developments involving or affecting oil-producing countries, or actions or reactions of the government of the United States in anticipation of or in response to such developments. 19Table of Contents Additionally, we follow the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our oil and natural gas properties. Under this method, the net book value of properties less related deferred income taxes, may not exceed a calculated ceiling, which is based upon the estimated after tax discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas properties. The excess, if any, of the net book value above the ceiling is required to be written off as an expense. See Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates for further details. A sufficient decline in oil or natural gas prices or other factors, without other mitigating circumstances, could result in future reductions of the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties and an equivalent charge to earnings. An increase in operating costs or a decline in our production level greater than anticipated could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Higher operating costs for our properties will directly decrease the amount of cash flow received by us. Electricity, supplies, and labor costs are a few of the operating costs that are susceptible to material fluctuation. The need for significant repairs and maintenance of infrastructure may increase as our properties age. A significant increase in operating costs could result in materially lower operating margin and cash flow. The level of production from our existing properties may decline at rates greater than anticipated due to unforeseen circumstances, many of which are beyond our control. A significant decline in our production could result in materially lower revenues and cash flow. Our operating results are affected by our ability to market the oil and natural gas that we produce. Our business depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of oil and natural gas gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities. Canadian federal and provincial, as well as United States federal and state, regulation of oil and natural gas production, processing and transportation, tax and energy policies, general economic conditions, and changes in supply and demand could adversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas. If market factors change and inhibit the marketing of our production, overall production or realized prices may decline. We are not the operator and have limited influence over the operations of the majority of our oil and natural gas properties. We hold minority interests in the majority of our oil and natural gas properties. As a result, we cannot control the pace of exploration or development, major decisions affecting the drilling of wells or the plan for development and production at non-operated properties, although contract provisions give Barnwell certain consent rights in some matters. The operators influence over these matters can affect the pace at which we incur capital expenditures. Additionally, as certain underlying joint venture data is not accessible to us, we depend on the operators at non-operated properties to provide us with reliable accounting information. We are dependent upon future discoveries or acquisitions of oil and natural gas to maintain our reserves. We actively explore for oil and natural gas reserves. However, future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and may involve substantial costs. Despite this uncertainty or potential cost, discoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and  20Table of Contents production. As a result, future oil and natural gas reserves may be dependent on our success in exploiting existing properties and acquiring additional reserves. If our access to capital becomes limited or unavailable, our ability to make the necessary capital investments to maintain or expand our oil and natural gas reserves will be impaired. Additionally, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in developing additional reserves or acquiring additional reserves on terms that meet our investment objectives. Without these reserve additions, our reserves will deplete and as a consequence, either production from, or the average reserve life of, our properties will decline. Future oil and natural gas segment taxable income could vary significantly from estimates, which could in turn result in the inability to realize a portion or all of our deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance has been provided. Our deferred tax assets include liabilities accrued for books but not for tax under Canadian tax law. Our ability to realize these deferred tax assets is based upon long-term estimates of future Canadian taxable income. If new operational strategies and estimates of oil and natural gas drilling success do not materialize as planned and the levels and timing of future taxable income and liability payments differ sufficiently from our estimates, or if negative evidence of future realizability cannot be overcome despite our plans and estimates, some or all of these deferred tax assets would not be deemed realizable, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Actual reserves will vary from reserve estimates. Estimating reserves is inherently uncertain and the reserves estimation process involves significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The reserve data and standardized measures set forth herein are only estimates. Ultimately, actual reserves attributable to our properties will vary from estimates, and those variations may be material. The estimation of reserves involves a number of factors and assumptions, including, among others: ·                 oil and natural gas prices as prescribed by SEC regulations;·                 historical production from our wells compared with production rates from similar producing wells in the area;·                 future commodity prices, production and development costs, royalties and capital expenditures;·                 initial production rates;·                 production decline rates;·                 ultimate recovery of reserves;·                 success of future development activities;·                 marketability of production;·                 effects of government regulation; and·                 other government levies that may be imposed over the producing life of reserves. If these factors, assumptions and prices prove to be inaccurate, actual results may vary materially from reserve estimates. 21Table of Contents Delays in business operations could adversely affect our distributions. In addition to the usual delays in payment by purchasers of oil and natural gas to the operators of our properties, and the delays of those operators in remitting payment to us, payments between any of these parties may also be delayed by: ·                 restrictions imposed by lenders;·                 accounting delays;·                 delays in the sale or delivery of products;·                 delays in the connection of wells to a gathering system;·                 blowouts or other accidents;·                 adjustments for prior periods;·                 recovery by the operator of expenses incurred in the operation of the properties; and·                 the establishment by the operator of reserves for these expenses. Any of these delays could expose us to additional third party credit risks. The industry in which we operate exposes us to potential liabilities that may not be covered by insurance. Our operations are subject to all of the risks associated with the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties, including the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, and the production and transportation of oil and natural gas. These risks include encountering unexpected formations or pressures, premature declines of reservoirs, blow-outs, equipment failures and other accidents, cratering, sour gas releases, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, adverse weather conditions, pollution, other environmental risks, fires and spills. A number of these risks could result in personal injury, loss of life, or environmental and other damage to our property or the property of others. While we maintain reserves for anticipated liabilities and carry various levels of insurance, we could be affected by civil, criminal, regulatory or administrative actions, claims or proceedings. We cannot fully protect against all of the risks listed above, nor are all of these risks insurable. There is no assurance that any applicable insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability for the risks listed above. We could face substantial losses if an event occurs for which we are not fully insured or are not indemnified against or a customer or insurer fails to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations. In addition, there can be no assurance that insurance will continue to be available to cover any or all of these risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive. We may incur material costs to comply with or as a result of health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations. The oil and natural gas industry is subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to local, provincial and federal legislation. A violation of that legislation may result in the imposition of fines or the issuance of clean up orders. Legislation regulating the oil and natural gas industry may be changed to impose higher standards and potentially more costly obligations. Although we have recorded a provision in our financial statements relating to our estimated future environmental and reclamation obligations that we believe is reasonable, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to satisfy our actual future environmental and reclamation obligations. 22Table of Contents For wells and facilities in the Province of Alberta, the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) tracks each licensees deemed asset value and estimated abandonment and reclamation liabilities, and imposes a security deposit on operators whose estimated liabilities exceed their deemed asset value. At September 30, 2013, the Company had sufficient deemed asset value that no security deposit was due. A requirement to provide security deposit funds to the AER in the future would result in the diversion of operating cash flows that could otherwise be used to fund oil and natural gas reserve replacement efforts, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are not fully insured against certain environmental risks, either because such insurance is not available or because of high premium costs. In particular, insurance against risks from environmental pollution occurring over time, as opposed to sudden and catastrophic damages, is not available on economically reasonable terms. Accordingly, any site reclamation or abandonment costs actually incurred in the ordinary course of business in a specific period could negatively impact our cash flow. Should we be unable to fully fund the cost of remedying an environmental problem, we might be required to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy. We may have difficulty funding our planned capital expenditures, which could have an adverse effect on our business. We make and expect to continue to make capital expenditures in our exploration and development projects. Without adequate capital resources, our drilling and other activities may be limited and our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer. We may not be able to generate sufficient operating cash flows or secure necessary financing on reasonable terms or at all and financing may not continue to be available to us under our existing financing arrangements. If capital resources are unavailable, we may be forced to curtail our drilling, development and other activities or be forced to sell some of our assets under untimely or unfavorable terms. Any such curtailment or sale could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our operations are subject to domestic and foreign government regulation and other risks, particularly in Canada and the United States. Barnwells oil and natural gas operations are affected by political developments and laws and regulations, particularly in Canada and the United States, such as restrictions on production, restrictions on imports and exports, the maintenance of specified reserves, tax increases and retroactive tax claims, expropriation of property, cancellation of contract rights, environmental protection controls, environmental compliance requirements and laws pertaining to workers health and safety. Further, the right to explore for and develop oil and natural gas on lands in Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia is controlled by the governments of each of those provinces. Changes in royalties and other terms of provincial leases, permits and reservations may have a substantial effect on Barnwells operations. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from our operations in Canada. In fiscal 2013, we derived 89% of our revenues from operations in Canada. 23Table of Contents Additionally, our ability to compete in the Canadian oil and natural gas industry may be adversely affected by governmental regulations or other policies that favor the awarding of contracts to contractors in which Canadian nationals have substantial ownership interests. Furthermore, we may face governmentally imposed restrictions or fees from time to time on the transfer of funds to the U.S. Government regulations control and often limit access to potential markets and impose extensive requirements concerning employee safety, environmental protection, pollution control and remediation of environmental contamination. Environmental regulations, in particular, prohibit access to some markets and make others less economical, increase equipment and personnel costs and often impose liability without regard to negligence or fault. In addition, governmental regulations may discourage our customers activities, reducing demand for our products and services. Compliance with foreign tax and other laws may adversely affect our operations. Tax and other laws and regulations are not always interpreted consistently among local, regional and national authorities. Income tax laws, other legislation or government incentive programs relating to the oil and natural gas industry may in the future be changed or interpreted in a manner that adversely affects us and our stockholders. It is also possible that in the future we will be subject to disputes concerning taxation and other matters in Canada, including the manner in which we calculate our income for tax purposes, and these disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Unforeseen title defects may result in a loss of entitlement to production and reserves. Although we conduct title reviews in accordance with industry practice prior to any purchase of resource assets or property, such reviews do not guarantee that an unforeseen defect in the chain of title will not arise and defeat our title to the purchased assets. If such a defect were to occur, our entitlement to the production from such purchased assets could be jeopardized. Risks Related to Land Investment Segment The market value of our real estate interests could decline, which may require write-downs of the carrying value of our residential lots held for investment to its estimated fair value. Any write-downs would negatively impact our results of operations. The market value of residential lots can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing economic market conditions. Economic conditions in the United States and the world have improved in recent years but the recovery remains weak, which puts continued pressure on consumer confidence for residential real estate. These challenging market conditions are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and may deteriorate. Prevailing market conditions may significantly influence the market value of our residential parcels held for investment. In the event of changes in economic or market conditions, we may have to sell the residential lots at lower margins or at a loss, or we may be required to write-down the carrying value of our residential parcels held for investment. Such write-downs would have a negative impact on our results of operations. Our real estate business is concentrated in the state of Hawaii. As a result, our financial results are dependent on the economic growth and health of Hawaii, particularly the island of Hawaii. Barnwells land investment segment is impacted by the condition of Hawaiis real estate market, which is affected by Hawaiis economy and Hawaiis tourism industry, as well as the United  24Table of Contents States and world economies in general. Any future cash flows from Barnwells land development activities are subject to, among other factors, the level of real estate activity and prices, the demand for new housing and second homes on the island of Hawaii, the rate of increase in the cost of building materials and labor, the introduction of building code modifications, changes to zoning laws, and the level of confidence in Hawaiis economy. Receipt of future percentage of sales payments is dependent upon the developers continued efforts to develop and market the property. We are entitled to receive future payments based on a percentage of the sales prices of residential homes and lots within approximately 870 acres in the Kaupulehu area. However, in order to collect such percentage of sales payments we are reliant upon an unaffiliated third party developer to continue to develop and market the homes and lots. The receipt of future percentage of sales payments could be jeopardized if the developer fails to proceed with development and marketing of the property. The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business. The occurrence of a natural disaster in Hawaii such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop and sell properties or realize income from our projects. The occurrence of a natural disaster could also cause property and flood insurance rates and deductibles to increase, which could reduce demand for our properties. Increases in interest rates, tightening of lending standards and decreases, limitations or restrictions in the availability of mortgage financing and other economic factors outside our control, such as consumer confidence and declines in employment levels could lead to slowed home sales, which could adversely affect our revenues and earnings. The United States residential mortgage market continues to experience disruption. Mortgage interest rates have been experiencing significant volatility and contributed to the challenging market conditions faced by us and the industry. In addition, as a result of increased default rates and other factors, the willingness of many lenders to make home mortgage loans has decreased and lenders have tightened their lending standards. The volatility in interest rates, the decrease in the willingness of lenders to make home mortgage loans, and the tightening of lending standards have made it more difficult for some potential buyers to finance the purchase of homes. Potential buyers may not be able to obtain acceptable financing to purchase residential lots within the Kaupulehu area, leading to further declines in the market for homes. Even if potential buyers do not need financing, changes in interest rates and mortgage availability could make it harder for them to sell their existing homes to potential buyers who need financing. Any limitations or restrictions on the availability of mortgage financing or interest rate increases could reduce residential lot sales and adversely affect our sales, which would reduce our revenues. Our business is subject to extensive regulation which makes it difficult and expensive for us to conduct our operations. We are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to land use and development and to environmental compliance and permitting obligations, including those related to the use, storage, discharge, emission, and disposal of hazardous materials. In most cases, approval to develop requires multiple permits which involve a long, uncertain and costly regulatory process. Any failure to comply with these laws could result in capital or operating expenditures or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations that could adversely affect present and future operations, or jeopardize our ability to sell the leasehold interest currently held. 25Table of Contents If required land use entitlements are not obtained at reasonable costs, or at all, our operating results could be adversely affected. We hold the leasehold interest to approximately 1,000 acres of vacant land that is currently zoned conservation. Our success in selling this interest may be contingent upon obtaining the necessary reclassification from the State of Hawaii Land Use Commission and county of Hawaii. Obtaining the necessary reclassification and ministerial approvals is often difficult, costly and may take several years, or more, to complete. Delays or failures to obtain the necessary reclassification approvals may adversely affect our financial results. Risks Related to Contract Drilling Segment Demand for water well drilling and/or pump installation is volatile. A decrease in demand for our services could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. Demand for services is highly dependent upon land development activities in the state of Hawaii. As also noted above, the real estate development industry is cyclical in nature and is particularly vulnerable to shifts in local, regional, and national economic conditions outside of our control such as interest rates, housing demand, population growth, employment levels and job growth and property taxes. A decrease in water well drilling and/or pump installation contracts will result in decreased revenues and operating results. A significant portion of our contract drilling business is dependent on municipalities and a decline in municipal spending could adversely impact our business. A significant portion of our contract drilling division revenues is derived from water and infrastructure contracts with governmental entities or agencies. Reduced tax revenues and governmental budgets may limit spending by local governments which in turn will affect the demand for our services. Material reductions in spending by a significant number of local governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial position. Our contract drilling operations face significant competition. We face competition for our services from a variety of competitors. Many of our competitors utilize drilling rigs that drill as quickly as our equipment but require less labor. Our strategy is to compete based on pricing and to a lesser degree, quality of service. If we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors, our financial results could be adversely affected. The loss of or damage to key vendor, customer or sub-contractor relationships would adversely affect our operations. Our contract drilling business is dependent on our relationships with key vendors, customers and subcontractors. The loss of or damage to any of our key relationships could negatively affect our business. 26Table of Contents Awarding of contracts is dependent upon our ability to obtain contract bid and performance bonds from insurers. Although the Company has not experienced difficulties in obtaining such bonds in the past, there can be no assurance that our ability to obtain such bonds will continue on the same basis as the past. Additionally, bonding insurance rates may increase and have an impact on our ability to win competitive bids, which could have a corresponding material impact on contract drilling operating results. The contracts in our backlog are subject to change orders and cancellation. Our backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under contracts that have been started and new contracts not yet started. Our contracts are subject to change orders and cancellations, and such changes could adversely affect our operations. The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business. The occurrence of a natural disaster in Hawaii such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete our contracts. Risks Related to Residential Real Estate Segment The market value of our real estate interests could decline, which may require write-downs of the carrying value of our real estate held for sale to its estimated fair value. Any write-downs would negatively impact our results of operations. Economic conditions in the United States and the world have improved in recent years but the recovery remains weak, which puts continued pressure on consumer confidence for residential real estate. These challenging market conditions are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and these conditions may deteriorate. Prevailing market conditions significantly influence the market value of our real estate held for sale. If the market conditions deteriorate, we will be required to write-down the carrying value of our real estate held for sale. Such write-downs would have a negative impact on our results of operations. We are reliant upon the sale of our home as a source of liquidity. If we are unable to sell the home within a reasonable timeframe, operating results, cash inflows and financial condition could be materially impacted. Barnwell currently owns one luxury residence that is available for sale in the Lot 4A Increment I area of Kaupulehu, North Kona, Hawaii. Monthly payments of principal and interest on the related real estate loan are due on the first day of each month and will change as a result of a change in the interest rate, the sale of the house or the sale of a residential parcel. Upon the sale of the house or a residential parcel, we will be required to make a principal payment in the amount of the net sales proceeds of the house or residential parcel. Any unpaid principal balance and accrued interest will be due and payable on April 1, 2018. The timing and amount of residential home sales are unpredictable and may be sporadic. The inability to sell the home within a reasonable timeframe will lead to additional interest, maintenance, property taxes and other holding costs. Furthermore, if estimated cash inflows from the home sale is less than current expectations, operating results, cash inflows and financial condition could be materially impacted. 27Table of Contents Severe weather and other natural conditions or disasters may impair the value of our real estate property. Severe weather and other natural conditions or disasters, such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts, floods, and heavy or prolonged rain, can negatively affect our operations by requiring us to perform potentially costly repairs to our projects. Further, these conditions can delay home closings, adversely affect the cost or availability of materials or labor, or impair the value of the property on a temporary or permanent basis. To the extent our insurance is not adequate to cover business interruption losses or repair costs resulting from these events, our total earned revenues and earnings may be adversely affected. We may need financing to fund our future real estate development activities. If we are unable to obtain sufficient financing, we may not be able to continue our residential real estate segment operations. The real estate development industry is capital intensive and homebuilding requires significant up-front expenditures to acquire land and begin development. We will need to establish funding sources to finance any future land acquisition capital expenditures. If such sources are not sufficient, we would seek additional capital in the form of debt or equity financing from a variety of potential sources, including additional bank financing, joint venture partner financing, and/or securities offerings. The amount and types of indebtedness which we may incur are limited by the terms of the agreements governing our existing debt. In addition, the availability of borrowed funds to be utilized for land acquisition, development and construction may be greatly reduced, and the lending community may require increased amounts of equity to be invested in a project by borrowers in connection with both new loans and the extension of existing loans. The failure to obtain sufficient capital to fund our planned capital and other expenditures could affect our plans to continue our residential real estate segment operations. Our operating results from homebuilding are expected to be variable. Due to the cyclical nature of the real estate development industry, we expect to experience variability in our future operating results on a quarterly and an annual basis. Factors expected to contribute to this variability include, among other things: ·                 the timing of land acquisitions and permitting;·                 the timing of home closings and land sales;·                 our ability to continue to acquire additional land or options thereon on acceptable terms; and·                 the condition of the real estate market and the general economy. If the timing of land acquisitions, zoning or regulatory approvals is delayed it could result in a decrease in our revenues and earnings for the periods in which the delays occur and possibly subsequent periods. A delay in home closings due to natural disasters, adverse weather or contractor availability would have a similar impact on revenues and earnings for the period in which the delays occur. Further, revenues may increase in subsequent periods over what would normally be expected as a result of increased home closings as the delays described above are resolved. 28Table of Contents "
6,BRN,BARNWELL INDUSTRIES,2012-12-12,"ITEM 1A.                         RISK FACTORS The business of Barnwell and its subsidiaries face numerous risks, including those set forth below or those described elsewhere in this Form 10-K or in Barnwells other filings with the SEC.  The risks described below are not the only risks that Barnwell faces, nor are they necessarily listed in order of significance.  If any of the following risk factors should occur, our profitability, financial condition or liquidity could be materially impacted. Entity-Wide Risks The continued economic slowdown and depressed prices for natural gas may have impacts on our business and financial condition that we currently cannot predict. The economic slowdown has affected demand for oil and natural gas, luxury real estate, and water well drilling and pump installation services.  Additionally, the discovery and availability of natural gas from shale has resulted in an oversupply of natural gas in North America.  Absent a sufficient increase in natural gas and/or oil prices, it is unlikely that future oil and natural gas operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund the capital expenditure levels necessary to maintain current production and reserve levels. 16Table of Contents If Barnwells cash flow from operations is not sufficient to satisfy its capital expenditure requirements, there can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available to meet these requirements or available on terms acceptable to the Company.  Inability to access sufficient capital and credit, in combination with insufficient operating cash flows and land investment sales proceeds, will result in continuing decreases in oil and natural gas reserves that in turn will result in a decline in cash flows from oil and natural gas production to amounts that are insufficient to cover ongoing expenses and debt service requirements. Our future level of indebtedness and the terms of our financing arrangements may adversely affect our operations, financial condition and limit our growth. At September 30, 2012, we had borrowings under our credit facility and real estate loan of approximately $17.2 million.  In the ordinary course of business, we may incur significant additional debt in order to fund future capital expenditures, acquisitions and homebuilding activities. The terms of our credit facility and real estate loan impose restrictions on our ability and, in some cases, the ability of our subsidiaries to take a number of actions that we may otherwise desire to take, including one or more of the following: ·                 incurring additional debt, including guarantees of indebtedness;·                 making investments;·                 creating liens on our assets; and·                 selling assets. Our level of indebtedness and the covenants contained in our financing agreements could have important consequences.  For example, they could: ·                 limit our ability to obtain future financing, through equity offerings or debt financings, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, refinancing of indebtedness or general corporate and other activities;·                 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow for other purposes (i.e., working capital, capital expenditures, and other general business activities);·                 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, the changes in our business;·                 subject us to higher costs and more restrictive covenants in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes, if additional financing is obtained;·                 make us vulnerable to increases in interest rates as our credit facilities are subject to variable interest rates;·                 detract from our ability to successfully withstand a downturn in our business or the economy generally;·                 place us at a competitive disadvantage because we have more debt than some of our competitors; and·                 make us more vulnerable to general economic downturns and adverse developments in our industries, especially declines in oil and natural gas prices, and the economy in general. 17Table of Contents We may incur additional debt, including significant secured indebtedness, or issue additional stock in order to fund capital expenditures, make future acquisitions, and develop our properties.  A higher level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our obligations.  Our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance.  General economic conditions, oil and natural gas prices and financial, business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance.  Many of these factors are beyond our control.  Factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through a refinancing of our debt include financial market conditions, the value of our assets and our performance at the time we need capital. In addition, our Canadian revolving credit facility is subject to periodic redetermination.  A decrease in the facility could require us to repay indebtedness in excess of the borrowing base, or we may need to further secure the lenders with additional collateral. Furthermore, our real estate loan agreement contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with a consolidated debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.20 to 1 and a consolidated total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio not to exceed 1.85 to 1.  Noncompliance with any of the ratios could result in the need to pay down a portion of the outstanding borrowings before their scheduled due dates. The price of our common stock has been volatile and could continue to fluctuate substantially. The market price of our common stock has been volatile and could fluctuate based on a variety of factors, including: ·                 fluctuations in commodity prices;·                 variations in results of operations;·                 announcements by us and our competitors;·                 legislative or regulatory changes;·                 general trends in the industry;·                 general market conditions; and·                 analysts estimates and other events in the oil and natural gas industry. Failure to retain key personnel could hurt our operations. We require highly skilled and experienced personnel to operate our business.  In addition to competing in highly competitive industries, we compete in a highly competitive labor market.  Our business could be adversely affected by an inability to retain personnel or upward pressure on wages as a result of the highly competitive labor market. A small number of stockholders, including our executive officers, own a significant amount of our common stock and have influence over our business regardless of the opposition of other stockholders. As of September 30, 2012, four of our stockholders, including two of our executive officers, held approximately 44% of our outstanding common stock.  The interests of one or more of these stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders.  These stockholders have significant influence over all matters submitted to our stockholders, including the election of our directors, and could accelerate, delay, deter or prevent a change of control of the Company.  The significant stockholders who also are executive officers could significantly affect our business, policies and affairs. 18Table of Contents Adverse changes in actuarial assumptions used to calculate retirement plan costs due to economic or other factors, or lower returns on plan assets could adversely affect Barnwells results and financial condition. Retirement plan cash funding obligations and plan expenses and obligations are subject to a high degree of uncertainty and could increase in future years depending on numerous factors, including the performance of the financial markets, specifically the equity markets, and the levels of interest rates. We are involved as a passive minority-interest partner in joint ventures and are subject to risks associated with joint venture partnerships. We are involved as a passive minority-interest partner in joint venture relationships and may initiate future joint venture projects.  Entering into a joint venture as a passive minority-interest partner involves certain risks which include: ·                 the inability to exercise voting control over the joint venture;·                 economic or business interests which are not aligned with our venture partners, including the holding period and timing of ultimate sale of the ventures underlying assets; and·                 the inability for the venture partner to fulfill its commitments and obligations due to financial or other difficulties. Risks Related to Oil and Natural Gas Segment The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We compete for capital, acquisitions of reserves, undeveloped lands, skilled personnel, access to drilling rigs, service rigs and other equipment, access to processing facilities, pipeline capacity and in many other respects with a substantial number of other organizations, many of which may have greater technical and financial resources than we do.  Some of these organizations explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas, carry on refining operations and market oil and other products on a worldwide basis.  As a result of these complementary activities, some of our competitors may have competitive resources that are greater and more diverse than ours.  Furthermore, many of our competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production, such as changing prices and production levels, the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations.  If our competitors are able to capitalize on these competitive resources, it could adversely affect our revenues. Oil and natural gas prices are volatile.  Our results of operations and financial condition are highly dependent on the prices of and demand for our oil and natural gas production. Oil and natural gas prices are volatile and have fluctuated widely during recent years in response to many factors that are beyond our control.  These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty, weather, worldwide political instability, foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the level of consumer product demand, government regulations and taxes, the price and availability of alternative fuels and the overall economic environment.  Any decline in oil or natural gas prices may have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, operating cash flows, borrowing ability, reserves, and the amount of capital that we are able to allocate for the development of oil and natural gas reserves and future growth. 19Table of Contents Energy prices are also subject to other political and regulatory actions outside our control, which may include changes in the policies of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries or other developments involving or affecting oil-producing countries, or actions or reactions of the government of the United States in anticipation of or in response to such developments. If oil and natural gas prices decrease, we may be required to reduce the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties. We follow the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our oil and natural gas properties.  Under this method, the net book value of properties less related deferred income taxes, may not exceed a calculated ceiling.  The ceiling is the estimated after tax future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas properties, discounted at 10% per year.  In calculating discounted future net revenues, average first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas prices during the 12-month period ending in the reporting period are held constant, except for changes which are fixed and determinable by existing contracts.  The excess, if any, of the net book value above the ceiling is required to be written off as an expense.  A sufficient decline in oil or natural gas prices or other factors, without other mitigating circumstances, could result in future reductions of the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties and an equivalent charge to earnings. An increase in operating costs or a decline in our production level could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Higher operating costs for our properties will directly decrease the amount of cash flow received by us.  Electricity, supplies, and labor costs are a few of the operating costs that are susceptible to material fluctuation.  The need for significant repairs and maintenance of infrastructure may increase as our properties age.  A significant increase in operating costs could result in materially lower operating margin and cash flow. The level of production from our existing properties may decline at rates greater than anticipated due to unforeseen circumstances, many of which are beyond our control.  A significant decline in our production could result in materially lower revenues and cash flow. Our operating results are affected by our ability to market the oil and natural gas that we produce. Our business depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of natural gas gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities.  Canadian federal and provincial, as well as United States federal and state, regulation of oil and natural gas production, processing and transportation, tax and energy policies, general economic conditions, and changes in supply and demand could adversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas.  If market factors change and inhibit the marketing of our production, overall production or realized prices may decline. We are not the operator and have limited influence over the operations of the majority of our oil and natural gas properties. We hold minority interests in the majority of our oil and natural gas properties.  As a result, we cannot control the pace of exploration or development, major decisions affecting the drilling of wells or the plan for development and production at non-operated properties, although contract provisions  20Table of Contents give Barnwell certain consent rights in some matters.  The operators influence over these matters can affect the pace at which we incur capital expenditures.  Additionally, as certain underlying joint venture data is not accessible to us, we depend on the operators at non-operated properties to provide us with reliable accounting information. Our operations are subject to domestic and foreign government regulation and other risks, particularly in Canada and the United States. Barnwells oil and natural gas operations are affected by political developments and laws and regulations, particularly in Canada and the United States, such as restrictions on production, restrictions on imports and exports, the maintenance of specified reserves, tax increases and retroactive tax claims, expropriation of property, cancellation of contract rights, environmental protection controls, environmental compliance requirements and laws pertaining to workers health and safety.  Further, the right to explore for and develop oil and natural gas on lands in Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia is controlled by the governments of each of those provinces.  Changes in royalties and other terms of provincial leases, permits and reservations may have a substantial effect on Barnwells operations.  We derive a significant portion of our revenues from our operations in Canada.  In fiscal 2012, we derived 74% of our revenues from operations in Canada. Additionally, our ability to compete in the Canadian oil and natural gas industry may be adversely affected by governmental regulations or other policies that favor the awarding of contracts to contractors in which Canadian nationals have substantial ownership interests.  Furthermore, we may face governmentally imposed restrictions or fees from time to time on the transfer of funds to the U.S. Government regulations control and often limit access to potential markets and impose extensive requirements concerning employee safety, environmental protection, pollution control and remediation of environmental contamination.  Environmental regulations, in particular, prohibit access to some markets and make others less economical, increase equipment and personnel costs and often impose liability without regard to negligence or fault.  In addition, governmental regulations may discourage our customers activities, reducing demand for our products and services. Compliance with foreign tax and other laws may adversely affect our operations. Tax and other laws and regulations are not always interpreted consistently among local, regional and national authorities.  Income tax laws, other legislation or government incentive programs relating to the oil and natural gas industry may in the future be changed or interpreted in a manner that adversely affects us and our stockholders.  It is also possible that in the future we will be subject to disputes concerning taxation and other matters in Canada, including the manner in which we calculate our income for tax purposes, and these disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. We are dependent upon future discoveries or acquisitions of oil and natural gas to maintain our reserves. We actively explore for oil and natural gas reserves.  However, future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and may involve substantial costs.  Despite this uncertainty or potential cost, discoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production.  As a result, future oil and natural gas reserves may be dependent on our success in exploiting existing properties and acquiring additional reserves.  If our access to capital becomes limited or unavailable, our ability to make the necessary capital investments to maintain or expand our  21Table of Contents oil and natural gas reserves will be impaired.  Additionally, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in developing additional reserves or acquiring additional reserves on terms that meet our investment objectives.  Without these reserve additions, our reserves will deplete and as a consequence, either production from, or the average reserve life of, our properties will decline. Actual reserves will vary from reserve estimates. Estimating reserves is inherently uncertain and the reserves estimation process involves significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data.  The reserve data and standardized measures set forth herein are only estimates.  Ultimately, actual reserves attributable to our properties will vary from estimates, and those variations may be material.  The estimation of reserves involves a number of factors and assumptions, including, among others: ·                 oil and natural gas prices as prescribed by the SEC;·                 historical production from our wells compared with production rates from similar producing wells in the area;·                 future commodity prices, production and development costs, royalties and capital expenditures;·                 initial production rates;·                 production decline rates;·                 ultimate recovery of reserves;·                 success of future development activities;·                 marketability of production;·                 effects of government regulation; and·                 other government levies that may be imposed over the producing life of reserves. If these factors, assumptions and prices prove to be inaccurate, actual results may vary materially from reserve estimates. Delays in business operations could adversely affect our distributions. In addition to the usual delays in payment by purchasers of oil and natural gas to the operators of our properties, and the delays of those operators in remitting payment to us, payments between any of these parties may also be delayed by: ·                 restrictions imposed by lenders;·                 accounting delays;·                 delays in the sale or delivery of products;·                 delays in the connection of wells to a gathering system;·                 blowouts or other accidents;·                 adjustments for prior periods;·                 recovery by the operator of expenses incurred in the operation of the properties; and·                 the establishment by the operator of reserves for these expenses. Any of these delays could expose us to additional third party credit risks. 22Table of Contents The industry in which we operate exposes us to potential liabilities that may not be covered by insurance. Our operations are subject to all of the risks associated with the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties, including the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, and the production and transportation of oil and natural gas.  These risks include encountering unexpected formations or pressures, premature declines of reservoirs, blow-outs, equipment failures and other accidents, cratering, sour gas releases, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, adverse weather conditions, pollution, other environmental risks, fires and spills.  A number of these risks could result in personal injury, loss of life, or environmental and other damage to our property or the property of others. While we maintain reserves for anticipated liabilities and carry various levels of insurance, we could be affected by civil, criminal, regulatory or administrative actions, claims or proceedings.  We cannot fully protect against all of the risks listed above, nor are all of these risks insurable.  There is no assurance that any applicable insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability for the risks listed above.  We could face substantial losses if an event occurs for which we are not fully insured or are not indemnified against or a customer or insurer fails to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations.  In addition, there can be no assurance that insurance will continue to be available to cover any or all of these risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive. We may incur material costs to comply with or as a result of health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations. The oil and natural gas industry is subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to local, provincial and federal legislation.  A violation of that legislation may result in the imposition of fines or the issuance of clean up orders.  Legislation regulating the oil and natural gas industry may be changed to impose higher standards and potentially more costly obligations.  Although we have recorded a provision in our financial statements relating to our estimated future environmental and reclamation obligations that we believe is reasonable, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to satisfy our actual future environmental and reclamation obligations. We are not fully insured against certain environmental risks, either because such insurance is not available or because of high premium costs.  In particular, insurance against risks from environmental pollution occurring over time, as opposed to sudden and catastrophic damages, is not available on economically reasonable terms.  Accordingly, any site reclamation or abandonment costs actually incurred in the ordinary course of business in a specific period could negatively impact our cash flow.  Should we be unable to fully fund the cost of remedying an environmental problem, we might be required to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy. We may have difficulty funding our planned capital expenditures, which could have an adverse effect on our business. We make and expect to continue to make capital expenditures in our exploration and development projects.  Without adequate capital resources, our drilling and other activities may be limited and our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.  We may not be able to generate sufficient operating cash flows or secure necessary financing on reasonable terms or at all  23Table of Contents and financing may not continue to be available to us under our existing financing arrangements.  If capital resources are unavailable, we may be forced to curtail our drilling, development and other activities or be forced to sell some of our assets under untimely or unfavorable terms.  Any such curtailment or sale could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Unforeseen title defects may result in a loss of entitlement to production and reserves. Although we conduct title reviews in accordance with industry practice prior to any purchase of resource assets or property, such reviews do not guarantee that an unforeseen defect in the chain of title will not arise and defeat our title to the purchased assets.  If such a defect were to occur, our entitlement to the production from such purchased assets could be jeopardized. Risks Related to Land Investment Segment The real estate investment industry continues to experience a slowdown that may persist for an indefinite period.  This downturn in economic conditions could adversely affect our business, results of operations and stockholders equity. The real estate investment industry is cyclical in nature and is particularly vulnerable to shifts in local, regional, and national economic conditions outside of our control such as interest rates, housing demand, population growth, employment levels, job growth and property taxes.  Further, a weakening of the economic drivers in Hawaii, which include tourism, military spending, construction starts and employment, and a decrease in market demand adversely impacted the level of real estate activity in Hawaii.  The industry has experienced a significant decrease in demand for new luxury resort real estate since 2007 and this trend may continue for an extended period of time.  Conditions in both the United States and international economies remain weak, which puts continued pressure on consumer confidence for residential real estate.  These challenging market conditions are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and, in the near term, these conditions may further deteriorate.  We expect that continued weakness in the industry could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Considerable economic and political uncertainties currently exist that could have adverse effects on consumer buying habits, construction costs, availability of labor and materials and other factors affecting us and the real estate industry in general.  Significant expenditures associated with investment in real estate, such as real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance costs and debt payments, cannot generally be reduced even though changes in Hawaiis or the nations economy may cause a decrease in revenues from our properties. Our real estate business is concentrated in the state of Hawaii.  As a result, our financial results are dependent on the economic growth and health of Hawaii, particularly the island of Hawaii. Barnwells land investment segment is impacted by the condition of Hawaiis real estate market, which is affected by Hawaiis economy and Hawaiis tourism industry, as well as the United States and world economies in general.  Any future cash flows from Barnwells land development activities are subject to, among other factors, the level of real estate activity and prices, the demand for new housing and second homes on the island of Hawaii, the rate of increase in the cost of building materials and labor, the introduction of building code modifications, changes to zoning laws, and the level of confidence in Hawaiis economy. 24Table of Contents The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business. The occurrence of a natural disaster in Hawaii such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop and sell properties or realize income from our projects.  The occurrence of a natural disaster could also cause property and flood insurance rates and deductibles to increase, which could reduce demand for our properties. Increases in interest rates, tightening of lending standards and decreases, limitations or restrictions in the availability of mortgage financing and other economic factors outside our control, such as consumer confidence and declines in employment levels could lead to slowed home sales, which could adversely affect our revenues and earnings. The United States residential mortgage market continues to experience disruption.  Mortgage interest rates have been experiencing significant volatility and contributed to the challenging market conditions faced by us and the industry.  In addition, as a result of increased default rates and other factors, the willingness of many lenders to make home mortgage loans has decreased and lenders have tightened their lending standards.  The volatility in interest rates, the decrease in the willingness of lenders to make home mortgage loans, and the tightening of lending standards have made it more difficult for some potential buyers to finance the purchase of homes.  Potential buyers may not be able to obtain acceptable financing to purchase residential lots within the Kaupulehu area, leading to further declines in the market for homes.  Any limitations or restrictions on the availability of mortgage financing or increases in mortgage interest rates could reduce residential lot sales, thereby reducing our revenues and earnings.  Even if potential buyers do not need financing, changes in interest rates and mortgage availability could make it harder for them to sell their existing homes to potential buyers who need financing.  Any limitations or restrictions on the availability of mortgage financing or interest rate increases could adversely affect our sales, which would reduce our revenues. Our business is subject to extensive regulation which makes it difficult and expensive for us to conduct our operations. We are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to land use and development and to environmental compliance and permitting obligations, including those related to the use, storage, discharge, emission, and disposal of hazardous materials.  In most cases, approval to develop requires multiple permits which involve a long, uncertain and costly regulatory process.  Any failure to comply with these laws could result in capital or operating expenditures or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations that could adversely affect present and future operations, or jeopardize our ability to sell the leasehold interest currently held. Receipt of future percentage of sales payments is dependent upon the developers continued efforts to develop and market the property. We are entitled to receive future payments based on a percentage of the sales prices of residential homes and lots within approximately 870 acres in the Kaupulehu area.  However, in order to collect such percentage of sales payments we are reliant upon an unaffiliated third party developer to continue to develop and market the homes and lots.  The receipt of future percentage of sales payments could be jeopardized if the developer fails to proceed with development and marketing of the property. 25Table of Contents If required land use entitlements are not obtained at reasonable costs, or at all, our operating results could be adversely affected. We hold the leasehold interest to approximately 1,000 acres of vacant land that is currently zoned conservation.  Our success in selling this interest may be contingent upon obtaining the necessary reclassification from the State of Hawaii Land Use Commission and county of Hawaii.  Obtaining the necessary reclassification and ministerial approvals is often difficult, costly and may take several years, or more, to complete.  Delays or failures to obtain the necessary reclassification approvals may adversely affect our financial results. The market value of our real estate interests could decline, which may require write-downs of the carrying value of our residential lots held for investment to its estimated fair value.  Any write-downs would negatively impact our results of operations. The risk of owning undeveloped lots can be substantial, and we may have bought lots which we cannot profitably sell.  The market value of residential lots can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing economic market conditions.  Prevailing market conditions may significantly influence the market value of our residential parcels held for investment.  In the event of changes in economic or market conditions, we may have to sell the residential lots at lower margins or at a loss.  Furthermore, if market conditions continue to deteriorate, we may be required to write-down the carrying value of our residential parcels held for investment.  Such write-downs would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Risks Related to Contract Drilling Segment Demand for water well drilling and/or pump installation is volatile.  A decrease in demand for our services could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. Demand for services is highly dependent upon land development activities in the state of Hawaii.  As also noted above, the real estate development industry is cyclical in nature and is particularly vulnerable to shifts in local, regional, and national economic conditions outside of our control such as interest rates, housing demand, population growth, employment levels and job growth and property taxes.  A decrease in water well drilling and/or pump installation contracts will result in decreased revenues and operating results. A significant portion of our contract drilling business is dependent on municipalities and a decline in municipal spending could adversely impact our business. A significant portion of our contract drilling division revenues is derived from water and infrastructure contracts with governmental entities or agencies.  Reduced tax revenues and governmental budgets may limit spending by local governments which in turn will affect the demand for our services.  Material reductions in spending by a significant number of local governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial position. Our contract drilling operations face significant competition. We face competition for our services from a variety of competitors.  Many of our competitors utilize drilling rigs that drill as quickly as our equipment but require less labor.  Our strategy is to compete based on pricing and to a lesser degree, quality of service.  If we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors, our financial results could be adversely affected. 26Table of Contents The loss of or damage to key vendor, customer or sub-contractor relationships would adversely affect our operations. Our contract drilling business is dependent on our relationships with key vendors, customers and subcontractors.  The loss of or damage to any of our key relationships could negatively affect our business. Awarding of contracts is dependent upon our ability to obtain contract bid and performance bonds from insurers. Although the Company has not experienced difficulties in obtaining such bonds in the past, there can be no assurance that our ability to obtain such bonds will continue on the same basis as the past.  Additionally, bonding insurance rates may increase and have an impact on our ability to win competitive bids, which could have a corresponding material impact on contract drilling operating results. The contracts in our backlog are subject to change orders and cancellation. Our backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under contracts that have been started and new contracts not yet started.  Our contracts are subject to change orders and cancellations, and such changes could adversely affect our operations. The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business. The occurrence of a natural disaster in Hawaii such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete our contracts. Risks Related to Residential Real Estate Segment The market value of our real estate interests could decline, which may require write-downs of the carrying value of our real estate held for sale to its estimated fair value.  Any write-downs would negatively impact our results of operations. The risk of owning developed and undeveloped land can be substantial for homebuilders. Homebuilding requires that we acquire land for replacement and expansion of land inventory within our existing and new markets.  The risks inherent in purchasing and developing land increase as consumer demand for housing decreases.  Thus, we may have bought and developed land which we cannot profitably sell or on which we cannot profitably build and sell homes.  The market value of land, buildable lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing economic market conditions.  It is possible that the measures we employ to manage inventory risks will not be successful and as a result our operations may suffer.  In addition, inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing market.  Prevailing market conditions may significantly influence the market value of our real estate held for sale.  In the event of changes in economic or market conditions, we may have to sell homes or land inventory at lower margins or at a loss.  Furthermore, if the market conditions continue to deteriorate, we will be required to write-down the carrying value of our real estate held for sale.  Such write-downs would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. 27Table of Contents The homebuilding industry continues to experience a slowdown that may persist for an indefinite period.  This downturn in economic conditions could adversely affect our business, results of operations and stockholders equity. The homebuilding industry historically has been cyclical and is sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as employment levels, consumer confidence, consumer income, availability of financing and interest rate levels.  Adverse changes in any of these conditions generally, or in the market in which we operate, could decrease demand and pricing for new homes or result in customer cancellations of pending contracts, which could adversely affect the number of home deliveries we make or reduce the prices we can charge for homes, either of which could result in a reduction in our revenues or deterioration of our margins. The homebuilding industry has experienced a significant and sustained downturn characterized by decreased demand for new homes, an oversupply of both new and resale home inventories, including foreclosed homes; aggressive price competition among homebuilders, including increased incentives for home sales; and a more restrictive mortgage lending environment.  Economic conditions in the United States and the world remain weak, which puts continued pressure on consumer confidence for residential real estate.  These challenging market conditions are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and, in the near term, these conditions may further deteriorate.  Continued weakness in the homebuilding industry could further adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are reliant upon the sale of our home as a source of liquidity.  If we are unable to sell the home within a reasonable timeframe, operating results, cash inflows and financial condition could be materially impacted. Barnwell currently owns one luxury residence that is available for sale in the Lot 4A Increment I area of Kaupulehu, North Kona, Hawaii. Monthly payments of principal and interest on the related real estate loan are due on the first day of each month and will change as a result of a change in the interest rate, the sale of the house or the sale of a residential parcel.  Upon the sale of the house or a residential parcel, we will be required to make a principal payment in the amount of the net sales proceeds of the house or residential parcel.  Any unpaid principal balance and accrued interest will be due and payable on April 1, 2018. The timing and amount of residential home sales are unpredictable and may be sporadic.  The inability to sell the home within a reasonable timeframe will lead to additional interest, maintenance, property taxes and other holding costs.  Furthermore, if estimated cash inflows from the home sale is less than current expectations, operating results, cash inflows and financial condition could be materially impacted. We have limited experience in the homebuilding industry. Homebuilding is a relatively new business segment for us, and we are relying to a material extent on our business partners to help us execute our real estate business plan. 28Table of Contents We may need financing to fund our future real estate development activities.  If we are unable to obtain sufficient financing or such financing is obtained on adverse terms, we may not be able to operate our business as planned, which could adversely affect our results of operations and future growth. The real estate development industry is capital intensive and homebuilding requires significant up-front expenditures to acquire land and begin development.  We will need to establish funding sources to finance any future land acquisition capital expenditures.  If such sources are not sufficient, we would seek additional capital in the form of debt or equity financing from a variety of potential sources, including additional bank financing, joint venture partner financing, and/or securities offerings.  The amount and types of indebtedness which we may incur are limited by the terms of the agreements governing our existing debt.  In addition, the availability of borrowed funds to be utilized for land acquisition, development and construction may be greatly reduced, and the lending community may require increased amounts of equity to be invested in a project by borrowers in connection with both new loans and the extension of existing loans.  The failure to obtain sufficient capital to fund our planned capital and other expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our operating results from homebuilding are expected to be variable. Due to the cyclical nature of the real estate development industry, we expect to experience variability in our future operating results on a quarterly and an annual basis.  Factors expected to contribute to this variability include, among other things: ·                 the timing of land acquisitions and permitting;·                 the timing of home closings, land sales and level of home sales;·                 our ability to continue to acquire additional land or options thereon on acceptable terms; and·                 the condition of the real estate market and the general economy. For example, the timing of land acquisitions and permitting impacts our ability to pursue the development of new housing projects in accordance with our real estate business plan.  If the timing of land acquisitions, zoning or regulatory approvals is delayed, we will be delayed in our ability to develop housing projects, which would likely decrease our backlog.  Furthermore, these delays could result in a decrease in our revenues and earnings for the periods in which the delays occur and possibly subsequent periods until the planned housing projects can be completed.  A delay in home closings due to natural disasters, adverse weather or contractor availability would have a similar impact on revenues and earnings for the period in which the delays occur.  Further, revenues may increase in subsequent periods over what would normally be expected as a result of increased home closings as the delays described above are resolved. Changes in the government regulations applicable to homebuilders could restrict our business activities, increase our operating expenses and cause our revenues to decline. Regulatory requirements applicable to homebuilders could cause us to incur significant liabilities and operating expenses and could restrict our business activities.  We are subject to local, state and federal statutes and rules regulating, among other things, certain developmental matters, building and site design, and matters concerning the protection of worker health and safety, and the environment.  Our operating expenses may be increased by governmental regulations, such as building permit allocation ordinances, impact and other fees and taxes, which may be imposed to defray the cost  29Table of Contents of providing certain governmental services and improvements.  Other governmental regulations, such as building moratoriums and no growth or slow growth initiatives, which may be adopted in communities which have developed rapidly, may cause delays in our home projects or otherwise restrict our business activities resulting in reductions in our revenues.  Any delay or refusal to grant us necessary licenses, permits or approvals from government agencies could cause substantial increases to development costs or cause us to abandon the project and to sell the affected land at a potential loss, which in turn could harm our operating results. Our residential real estate segment is dependent on the continued availability and satisfactory performance of our building contractors, which, if unavailable, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We conduct our construction operations through unaffiliated building contractors.  As a consequence, we depend on the continued availability of and satisfactory performance by the contractors for the construction of our homes.  There may not be sufficient availability of and satisfactory performance by the contractors.  If the contractors quality of work is not sufficient, our ability to construct homes on the schedule we have planned would be affected.  This could result in an increase in our costs to construct homes in a timely manner, which could result in an increase in our overall costs and thus a decline in our margins and in our net income.  Further, non-timely completion of work could affect our ability to sell homes based upon our projected timeline thus possibly affecting our ability to obtain additional financing to continue our homebuilding efforts. Shortages of labor or materials and/or increases in the price of materials could delay construction or increase the cost of home construction thereby reducing our sales and earnings. The homebuilding business has from time to time experienced building material and labor shortages, as well as volatility in the prices of certain materials, including lumber, framing, drywall and cement, which are significant components of home construction costs.  These labor and material shortages can be more severe during periods of strong demand for housing or during periods where the area in which we operate experiences natural disasters that have a significant impact on existing residential and commercial structures.  Shortages and price increases could cause delays in and increase our costs of home construction, which in turn could harm our operating results. Severe weather and other natural conditions or disasters may impair the value of our real estate property. Severe weather and other natural conditions or disasters, such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts, floods, and heavy or prolonged rain, can negatively affect our operations by requiring us to perform potentially costly repairs to our projects.  Further, these conditions can delay home closings, adversely affect the cost or availability of materials or labor, or impair the value of the property on a temporary or permanent basis.  To the extent our insurance is not adequate to cover business interruption losses or repair costs resulting from these events, our total earned revenues and earnings may be adversely affected. The homebuilding industry is highly competitive and, with more limited resources than some of our competitors, we may not be able to compete effectively. The homebuilding industry is highly competitive.  We face competition from other developers on the island of Hawaii and from other luxury residential resort properties in Hawaii and the mainland United States.  In many cases, our competitors have greater financial and other resources, more  30Table of Contents established market positions, lower costs of capital, labor and material than we do.  Homebuilders compete for, among other things, desirable land, financing, raw materials, skilled labor and purchasers.  We compete for residential sales on the basis of a number of interrelated factors, including location, reputation, amenities, design, quality and price, with numerous homebuilders, including some homebuilders with greater financial resources and/or lower costs than us.  Increased competition could also reduce the number of homes we deliver, reducing our revenues, or cause us to accept reduced margins to maintain sales volumes.  A reduction in our revenue or margins due to competitive factors could affect our ability to service our debt, including the credit facilities. "
7,BRN,BARNWELL INDUSTRIES,2011-12-13,"ITEM 1A.                           RISK FACTORS The business of Barnwell and its subsidiaries face numerous risks, including those set forth below or those described elsewhere in this Form 10-K or in Barnwells other filings with the SEC.  The risks described below are not the only risks that Barnwell faces, nor are they necessarily listed in order of significance.  If any of the following risk factors should occur, our profitability, financial condition or liquidity could be materially impacted. Risks Related to Oil and Natural Gas Segment The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We compete for capital, acquisitions of reserves, undeveloped lands, skilled personnel, access to drilling rigs, service rigs and other equipment, access to processing facilities, pipeline capacity and in many other respects with a substantial number of other organizations, many of which may have greater technical and financial resources than we do.  Some of these organizations explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas, carry on refining operations and market oil and other products on a worldwide basis.  As a result of these complementary activities, some of our competitors may have competitive resources that are greater and more diverse than ours.  Furthermore, many of our competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production, such as changing prices and production levels, the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations.  If our competitors are able to capitalize on these competitive resources, it could adversely affect our revenues. Oil and natural gas prices are volatile.  Our results of operations and financial condition are highly dependent on the prices of and demand for our oil and natural gas production. Oil and natural gas prices are volatile and have fluctuated widely during recent years in response to many factors that are beyond our control.  These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty, weather, worldwide political instability, foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the level of consumer product demand, government regulations and taxes, the price and availability of alternative fuels and the overall economic environment.  Any decline in oil or natural gas prices may have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, operating cash flows, borrowing ability, reserves, and the amount of capital that we are able to allocate for the development of oil and natural gas reserves and future growth. Energy prices are also subject to other political and regulatory actions outside our control, which may include changes in the policies of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries or other developments involving or affecting oil-producing countries, or actions or reactions of the government of the United States in anticipation of or in response to such developments. If oil and natural gas prices decrease, we may be required to reduce the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties. We follow the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our oil and natural gas properties.  Under this method, the net book value of properties less related deferred income taxes, may not exceed a calculated ceiling.  The ceiling is the estimated after tax future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas properties, discounted at 10% per year.  In calculating discounted future net  17Table of Contents revenues, average first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas prices during the 12-month period ending in the reporting period are held constant, except for changes which are fixed and determinable by existing contracts.  The excess, if any, of the net book value above the ceiling is required to be written off as an expense.  A sufficient decline in oil or natural gas prices or other factors, without other mitigating circumstances, could result in reductions of the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties and an equivalent charge to earnings. An increase in operating costs or a decline in our production level could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Higher operating costs for our properties will directly decrease the amount of cash flow received by us.  Electricity, supplies, and labor costs are a few of the operating costs that are susceptible to material fluctuation.  The need for significant repairs and maintenance of infrastructure may increase as our properties age.  A significant increase in operating costs could result in materially lower operating margin and cash flow. The level of production from our existing properties may decline at rates greater than anticipated due to unforeseen circumstances, many of which are beyond our control.  A significant decline in our production could result in materially lower revenues and cash flow. Our operating results are affected by our ability to market the oil and natural gas that we produce. Our business depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of natural gas gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities.  Canadian federal and provincial, as well as United States federal and state, regulation of oil and natural gas production, processing and transportation, tax and energy policies, general economic conditions, and changes in supply and demand could adversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas.  If market factors change and inhibit the marketing of our production, overall production or realized prices may decline. We are not the operator and have limited influence over the operations of the majority of our oil and natural gas properties. We hold minority interests in the majority of our oil and natural gas properties.  As a result, we cannot control the pace of exploration or development, major decisions affecting the drilling of wells or the plan for development and production at non-operated properties, although contract provisions give Barnwell certain consent rights in some matters.  The operators influence over these matters can affect the pace at which we incur capital expenditures.  Additionally, as certain underlying joint venture data is not accessible to us, we depend on the operators at non-operated properties to provide us with reliable accounting information. Our operations are subject to domestic and foreign government regulation and other risks, particularly in Canada and the United States. Barnwells oil and natural gas operations are affected by political developments and laws and regulations, particularly in Canada and the United States, such as restrictions on production, restrictions on imports and exports, the maintenance of specified reserves, tax increases and retroactive tax claims, expropriation of property, cancellation of contract rights, environmental protection controls, environmental compliance requirements and laws pertaining to workers health and safety.  Further, the  18Table of Contents right to explore for and develop oil and natural gas on lands in Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia is controlled by the governments of each of those provinces.  Changes in royalties and other terms of provincial leases, permits and reservations may have a substantial effect on Barnwells operations.  We derive a significant portion of our revenues from our operations in Canada.  In fiscal 2011, we derived 80% of our revenues from operations in Canada. Additionally, our ability to compete in the Canadian oil and natural gas industry may be adversely affected by governmental regulations or other policies that favor the awarding of contracts to contractors in which Canadian nationals have substantial ownership interests.  Furthermore, we may face governmentally imposed restrictions or fees from time to time on the transfer of funds to the U.S. Government regulations control and often limit access to potential markets and impose extensive requirements concerning employee safety, environmental protection, pollution control and remediation of environmental contamination.  Environmental regulations, in particular, prohibit access to some markets and make others less economical, increase equipment and personnel costs and often impose liability without regard to negligence or fault.  In addition, governmental regulations may discourage our customers activities, reducing demand for our products and services. Compliance with foreign tax and other laws may adversely affect our operations. Tax and other laws and regulations are not always interpreted consistently among local, regional and national authorities.  Income tax laws, other legislation or government incentive programs relating to the oil and natural gas industry may in the future be changed or interpreted in a manner that adversely affects us and our stockholders.  It is also possible that in the future we will be subject to disputes concerning taxation and other matters in Canada, including the manner in which we calculate our income for tax purposes, and these disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. We are dependent upon future discoveries or acquisitions of oil and natural gas to maintain our reserves. We actively explore for oil and natural gas reserves.  However, future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and may involve substantial costs.  Despite this uncertainty or potential cost, discoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production.  As a result, future oil and natural gas reserves may be dependent on our success in exploiting existing properties and acquiring additional reserves.  If our access to capital becomes limited or unavailable, our ability to make the necessary capital investments to maintain or expand our oil and natural gas reserves will be impaired.  Additionally, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in developing additional reserves or acquiring additional reserves on terms that meet our investment objectives.  Without these reserve additions, our reserves will deplete and as a consequence, either production from, or the average reserve life of, our properties will decline. Actual reserves will vary from reserve estimates. Estimating reserves is inherently uncertain and the reserves estimation process involves significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data.  The reserve data and standardized measures set forth herein are only estimates.  Ultimately, actual reserves attributable to our properties will vary from estimates, and those  19Table of Contents variations may be material.  The estimation of reserves involves a number of factors and assumptions, including, among others:·                oil and natural gas prices as prescribed by the SEC;·                historical production from our wells compared with production rates from similar producing wells in the area;·                future commodity prices, production and development costs, royalties and capital expenditures;·                initial production rates;·                production decline rates;·                ultimate recovery of reserves;·                success of future development activities;·                marketability of production;·                effects of government regulation; and·                other government levies that may be imposed over the producing life of reserves. If these factors, assumptions and prices prove to be inaccurate, actual results may vary materially from reserve estimates. Delays in business operations could adversely affect our distributions. In addition to the usual delays in payment by purchasers of oil and natural gas to the operators of our properties, and the delays of those operators in remitting payment to us, payments between any of these parties may also be delayed by:·                restrictions imposed by lenders;·                accounting delays;·                delays in the sale or delivery of products;·                delays in the connection of wells to a gathering system;·                blowouts or other accidents;·                adjustments for prior periods;·                recovery by the operator of expenses incurred in the operation of the properties; and·                the establishment by the operator of reserves for these expenses. Any of these delays could expose us to additional third party credit risks. The industry in which we operate exposes us to potential liabilities that may not be covered by insurance. Our operations are subject to all of the risks associated with the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties, including the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, and the production and transportation of oil and natural gas.  These risks include encountering unexpected formations or pressures, premature declines of reservoirs, blow-outs, equipment failures and other accidents, cratering, sour gas releases, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, adverse weather conditions, pollution, other environmental risks, fires and spills.  A number of these risks could result in personal injury, loss of life, or environmental and other damage to our property or the property of others. 20Table of Contents While we maintain reserves for anticipated liabilities and carry various levels of insurance, we could be affected by civil, criminal, regulatory or administrative actions, claims or proceedings.  We cannot fully protect against all of the risks listed above, nor are all of these risks insurable.  There is no assurance that any applicable insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability for the risks listed above.  We could face substantial losses if an event occurs for which we are not fully insured or are not indemnified against or a customer or insurer fails to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations.  In addition, there can be no assurance that insurance will continue to be available to cover any or all of these risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive. We may incur material costs to comply with or as a result of health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations. The oil and natural gas industry is subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to local, provincial and federal legislation.  A violation of that legislation may result in the imposition of fines or the issuance of clean up orders.  Legislation regulating the oil and natural gas industry may be changed to impose higher standards and potentially more costly obligations.  For example, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, known as the Kyoto Protocol, was ratified by the Canadian government in December 2002 and will require, among other things, significant reductions in greenhouse gases.  The impact of the Kyoto Protocol on us is uncertain and may result in significant additional costs for our future operations.  Although we have recorded a provision in our financial statements relating to our estimated future environmental and reclamation obligations that we believe is reasonable, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to satisfy our actual future environmental and reclamation obligations. We are not fully insured against certain environmental risks, either because such insurance is not available or because of high premium costs.  In particular, insurance against risks from environmental pollution occurring over time, as opposed to sudden and catastrophic damages, is not available on economically reasonable terms.  Accordingly, any site reclamation or abandonment costs actually incurred in the ordinary course of business in a specific period could negatively impact our cash flow.  Should we be unable to fully fund the cost of remedying an environmental problem, we might be required to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy. We may have difficulty financing our planned capital expenditures, which could have an adverse effect on our business. We make and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our exploration and development projects.  Without adequate capital resources, our drilling and other activities may be limited and our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.  We may not be able to secure necessary financing on reasonable terms or at all and financing may not continue to be available to us under our existing financing arrangements.  If capital resources are unavailable, we may curtail our drilling, development and other activities or be forced to sell some of our assets under untimely or unfavorable terms.  Any such curtailment or sale could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 21Table of Contents Unforeseen title defects may result in a loss of entitlement to production and reserves. Although we conduct title reviews in accordance with industry practice prior to any purchase of resource assets or property, such reviews do not guarantee that an unforeseen defect in the chain of title will not arise and defeat our title to the purchased assets.  If such a defect were to occur, our entitlement to the production from such purchased assets could be jeopardized. Risks Related to Land Investment Segment The real estate investment industry continues to experience a slowdown that may persist for an indefinite period.  This downturn in economic conditions could adversely affect our business, results of operations and stockholders equity. The real estate investment industry is cyclical in nature and is particularly vulnerable to shifts in local, regional, and national economic conditions outside of our control such as interest rates, housing demand, population growth, employment levels, job growth and property taxes.  Further, a weakening of the economic drivers in Hawaii, which include tourism, military spending, construction starts and employment, and a decrease in market demand adversely impacted the level of real estate activity in Hawaii.  The industry has experienced a significant decrease in demand for new homes since 2007 and this trend may continue for an extended period of time.  Conditions in both the United States and international economies remain weak, which puts continued pressure on consumer confidence for residential real estate.  These challenging market conditions are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and, in the near term, these conditions may further deteriorate.  We expect that continued weakness in the industry could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Considerable economic and political uncertainties currently exist that could have adverse effects on consumer buying habits, construction costs, availability of labor and materials and other factors affecting us and the real estate industry in general.  Significant expenditures associated with investment in real estate, such as real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance costs and debt payments, cannot generally be reduced even though changes in Hawaiis or the nations economy may cause a decrease in revenues from our properties. Our real estate business is concentrated in the state of Hawaii.  As a result, our financial results are dependent on the economic growth and health of Hawaii, particularly the island of Hawaii. Barnwells land investment segment is impacted by the condition of Hawaiis real estate market, which is affected by Hawaiis economy and Hawaiis tourism industry, as well as the United States and world economies in general.  Any future cash flows from Barnwells land development activities are subject to, among other factors, the level of real estate activity and prices, the demand for new housing and second homes on the island of Hawaii, the rate of increase in the cost of building materials and labor, the introduction of building code modifications, changes to zoning laws, and the level of confidence in Hawaiis economy. The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business. The occurrence of a natural disaster in Hawaii such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop and sell properties or realize income from our projects.  The occurrence of a natural disaster could also cause property and flood insurance rates and deductibles to increase, which could reduce demand for our properties. 22Table of Contents Increases in interest rates, tightening of lending standards and decreases, limitations or restrictions in the availability of mortgage financing and other economic factors outside our control, such as consumer confidence and declines in employment levels could lead to slowed home sales, which could adversely affect our revenues and earnings. The United States residential mortgage market continues to experience disruption.  Mortgage interest rates have been experiencing significant volatility and contributed to the challenging market conditions faced by us and the industry.  In addition, as a result of increased default rates and other factors, the willingness of many lenders to make home mortgage loans has decreased and lenders have tightened their lending standards.  The volatility in interest rates, the decrease in the willingness of lenders to make home mortgage loans, and the tightening of lending standards have made it more difficult for some potential buyers to finance the purchase of homes.  Potential buyers may not be able to obtain acceptable financing to purchase residential lots within the Kaupulehu area, leading to further declines in the market for homes.  Any limitations or restrictions on the availability of mortgage financing or increases in mortgage interest rates could reduce residential lot sales, thereby reducing our revenues and earnings.  Even if potential buyers do not need financing, changes in interest rates and mortgage availability could make it harder for them to sell their existing homes to potential buyers who need financing.  Any limitations or restrictions on the availability of mortgage financing or interest rate increases could adversely affect our sales, which would reduce our revenues. Our business is subject to extensive regulation which makes it difficult and expensive for us to conduct our operations. We are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to land use and development and to environmental compliance and permitting obligations, including those related to the use, storage, discharge, emission, and disposal of hazardous materials.  In most cases, approval to develop requires multiple permits which involve a long, uncertain and costly regulatory process.  Any failure to comply with these laws could result in capital or operating expenditures or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations that could adversely affect present and future operations, or jeopardize our ability to sell the leasehold interest currently held. Receipt of future percentage of sales payments is dependent upon the developers continued efforts to develop and market the property. We are entitled to receive future payments based on a percentage of the sales prices of residential homes and lots within approximately 870 acres in the Kaupulehu area.  However, in order to collect such percentage of sales payments we are reliant upon an unaffiliated third party developer to continue to develop and market the homes and lots.  The receipt of future percentage of sales payments could be jeopardized if the developer fails to proceed with development and marketing of the property. 23Table of Contents If required land use entitlements are not obtained at reasonable costs, or at all, our operating results could be adversely affected. We hold the leasehold interest to approximately 1,000 acres of vacant land that is currently zoned conservation.  Our success in selling this interest may be contingent upon obtaining the necessary reclassification from the State of Hawaii Land Use Commission and county of Hawaii.  Obtaining the necessary reclassification and ministerial approvals is often difficult, costly and may take several years, or more, to complete.  Delays or failures to obtain the necessary reclassification approvals may adversely affect our financial results. The value of our lot acquisition rights could be impaired if the developer of the property is unable to obtain required land use entitlements or successfully negotiate development terms and agreements. We hold acquisition rights to 14 lots in agricultural-zoned leasehold lands in the upland area of Kaupulehu (Mauka Lands) situated between the Queen Kaahumanu Highway and the Mamalahoa Highway at Kaupulehu, North Kona, island and state of Hawaii.  The lot acquisition rights give us the right to purchase residential lots which may be developed on the Mauka Lands.  The ability to purchase residential lots and the value of such lots in the future is contingent upon the developer of the property obtaining the necessary land use reclassification, zoning and development approvals from regulatory entities.  Obtaining the necessary reclassification and ministerial approvals is often difficult, costly and may take several years, or more, to complete.  Delays or failures to obtain the necessary reclassification and rezoning approvals may adversely affect our financial results.  Our ability to purchase lots and the value of such lots is also contingent upon the ability of the developer of the property to successfully negotiate development terms and agreements within the Mauka Lands.  If the developer is unsuccessful in such negotiations, our ability to purchase residential lots in the Mauka Lands would be impaired. The market value of our real estate interests could decline, which may require write-downs of the carrying value of our residential lots held for investment to its estimated fair value.  Any write-downs would negatively impact our results of operations. The risk of owning undeveloped lots can be substantial and we may have bought lots which we cannot profitably sell.  The market value of residential lots can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing economic market conditions.  Prevailing market conditions may significantly influence the market value of our residential parcels held for investment.  In the event of changes in economic or market conditions, we may have to sell the residential lots at lower margins or at a loss.  Furthermore, if the market conditions continue to deteriorate, we may be required to record write-downs of the carrying value of our residential parcels held for investment.  Such write-downs would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Risks Related to Residential Real Estate Segment The homebuilding industry continues to experience a slowdown that may persist for an indefinite period.  This downturn in economic conditions could adversely affect our business, results of operations and stockholders equity. The homebuilding industry historically has been cyclical and is sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as employment levels, consumer confidence, consumer income, availability  24Table of Contents of financing and interest rate levels.  Adverse changes in any of these conditions generally, or in the market in which we operate, could decrease demand and pricing for new homes or result in customer cancellations of pending contracts, which could adversely affect the number of home deliveries we make or reduce the prices we can charge for homes, either of which could result in a reduction in our revenues or deterioration of our margins. The homebuilding industry has experienced a significant and sustained downturn characterized by decreased demand for new homes, an oversupply of both new and resale home inventories, including foreclosed homes; aggressive price competition among homebuilders, including increased incentives for home sales; and a more restrictive mortgage lending environment.  Economic conditions in the United States and the world remain weak, which puts continued pressure on consumer confidence for residential real estate.  These challenging market conditions are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and, in the near term, these conditions may further deteriorate.  Continued weakness in the homebuilding industry could further adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are reliant upon sales of homes as a source of liquidity.  If we are unable to sell the homes within a reasonable timeframe, our revenues, operating results, cash inflows and financial condition could be materially impacted. Barnwell currently owns two luxury residences that are available for sale in the Lot 4A Increment I area of Kaupulehu, North Kona, Hawaii. The acquisition of the parcels and home construction costs on the luxury homes were originally financed through a bank revolving credit facility and subsequently refinanced via a non-revolving term loan with a new lender during fiscal 2011.  The loan is a seven year term loan with an interest rate that adjusts annually. Monthly payments of principal and interest are due on the first day of each month and will change as a result of a change in the interest rate, the sale of a house or the sale of a residential parcel.  Upon the sale of a house or a residential parcel, we will be required to make a principal payment in the amount of the net sales proceeds of the house or residential parcel.  Any unpaid principal balance and accrued interest will be due and payable on April 1, 2018. The timing and amount of residential home sales are unpredictable and may be sporadic.  The inability to sell the homes within a reasonable timeframe will lead to additional interest, maintenance, property taxes and other holding costs.  Furthermore, if estimated cash inflows from home sales are less than current expectations, our revenues, operating results, cash inflows and financial condition could be materially impacted. We have limited experience in the homebuilding industry. Homebuilding is a new business segment for us and we are relying to a material extent on our business partners to help us execute our business plan. 25Table of Contents We may need financing to fund our future real estate development activities.  If we are unable to obtain sufficient financing or such financing is obtained on adverse terms, we may not be able to operate our business as planned, which could adversely affect our results of operations and future growth. The real estate development industry is capital intensive and homebuilding requires significant up-front expenditures to acquire land and begin development.  We will need to establish funding sources to finance any future land acquisition capital expenditures.  If such sources are not sufficient, we would seek additional capital in the form of debt or equity financing from a variety of potential sources, including additional bank financing, joint venture partner financing, and/or securities offerings.  The amount and types of indebtedness which we may incur are limited by the terms of the agreements governing our existing debt.  In addition, the availability of borrowed funds to be utilized for land acquisition, development and construction may be greatly reduced, and the lending community may require increased amounts of equity to be invested in a project by borrowers in connection with both new loans and the extension of existing loans.  The failure to obtain sufficient capital to fund our planned capital and other expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our operating results from homebuilding are expected to be variable. Due to the cyclical nature of the real estate development industry, we expect to experience variability in our future operating results on a quarterly and an annual basis.  Factors expected to contribute to this variability include, among other things:·                the timing of land acquisitions and permitting;·                the timing of home closings, land sales and level of home sales;·                our ability to continue to acquire additional land or options thereon on acceptable terms;·                the condition of the real estate market and the general economy; and·                delays in construction due to natural disasters, adverse weather, reduced contractor availability and strikes. For example, the timing of land acquisitions and permitting impacts our ability to pursue the development of new housing projects in accordance with our business plan.  If the timing of land acquisitions, zoning or regulatory approvals is delayed, we will be delayed in our ability to develop housing projects, which would likely decrease our backlog.  Furthermore, these delays could result in a decrease in our revenues and earnings for the periods in which the delays occur and possibly subsequent periods until the planned housing projects can be completed.  A delay in home closings due to natural disasters, adverse weather or contractor availability would have a similar impact on revenues and earnings for the period in which the delays occur.  Further, revenues may increase in subsequent periods over what would normally be expected as a result of increased home closings as the delays described above are resolved. Changes in the government regulations applicable to homebuilders could restrict our business activities, increase our operating expenses and cause our revenues to decline. Regulatory requirements applicable to homebuilders could cause us to incur significant liabilities and operating expenses and could restrict our business activities.  We are subject to local, state and federal statutes and rules regulating, among other things, certain developmental matters, building and site design, and matters concerning the protection of worker health and safety, and the  26Table of Contents environment.  Our operating expenses may be increased by governmental regulations, such as building permit allocation ordinances, impact and other fees and taxes, which may be imposed to defray the cost of providing certain governmental services and improvements.  Other governmental regulations, such as building moratoriums and no growth or slow growth initiatives, which may be adopted in communities which have developed rapidly, may cause delays in our home projects or otherwise restrict our business activities resulting in reductions in our revenues.  Any delay or refusal to grant us necessary licenses, permits or approvals from government agencies could cause substantial increases to development costs or cause us to abandon the project and to sell the affected land at a potential loss, which in turn could harm our operating results. Our residential real estate segment is dependent on the continued availability and satisfactory performance of our building contractors, which, if unavailable, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We conduct our construction operations through unaffiliated building contractors.  As a consequence, we depend on the continued availability of and satisfactory performance by the contractors for the construction of our homes.  There may not be sufficient availability of and satisfactory performance by the contractors.  If the contractors quality of work is not sufficient, our ability to construct homes on the schedule we have planned would be affected.  This could result in an increase in our costs to construct homes in a timely manner, which could result in an increase in our overall costs and thus a decline in our margins and in our net income.  Further, non-timely completion of work could affect our ability to sell homes based upon our projected timeline thus possibly affecting our ability to obtain additional financing to continue our homebuilding efforts. Shortages of labor or materials and/or increases in the price of materials could delay construction or increase the cost of home construction thereby reducing our sales and earnings. The homebuilding business has from time to time experienced building material and labor shortages, as well as volatility in the prices of certain materials, including lumber, framing, drywall and cement, which are significant components of home construction costs.  These labor and material shortages can be more severe during periods of strong demand for housing or during periods where the area in which we operate experiences natural disasters that have a significant impact on existing residential and commercial structures.  Shortages and price increases could cause delays in and increase our costs of home construction, which in turn could harm our operating results. The market value of our real estate interests could decline, which may require write-downs of the carrying value of our real estate held for sale to its estimated fair value.  Any write-downs would negatively impact our results of operations. The risk of owning developed and undeveloped land can be substantial for homebuilders. Homebuilding requires that we acquire land for replacement and expansion of land inventory within our existing and new markets.  The risks inherent in purchasing and developing land increase as consumer demand for housing decreases.  Thus, we may have bought and developed land which we cannot profitably sell or on which we cannot profitably build and sell homes.  The market value of land, buildable lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing economic market conditions.  It is possible that the measures we employ to manage inventory risks will not be successful and as a result our operations may suffer.  In addition, inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing market.  Prevailing market conditions may  27Table of Contents significantly influence the market value of our real estate held for sale.  In the event of changes in economic or market conditions, we may have to sell homes or land inventory at lower margins or at a loss.  Furthermore, if the market conditions continue to deteriorate, we will be required to record write-downs of the carrying value of our real estate held for sale.  Such write-downs would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Severe weather and other natural conditions or disasters may disrupt or delay construction and may impair the value of our real estate property. Severe weather and other natural conditions or disasters, such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts, floods, and heavy or prolonged rain, can negatively affect our operations by requiring us to delay or halt construction or to perform potentially costly repairs to our projects under construction and to unsold homes.  Further, these conditions can delay home closings, adversely affect the cost or availability of materials or labor, or impair the value of the property on a temporary or permanent basis.  To the extent our insurance is not adequate to cover business interruption losses or repair costs resulting from these events, our total earned revenues and earnings may be adversely affected. The homebuilding industry is highly competitive and, with more limited resources than some of our competitors, we may not be able to compete effectively. The homebuilding industry is highly competitive.  We face competition from other developers on the island of Hawaii and from other luxury residential properties in Hawaii and the mainland United States.  In many cases, our competitors have greater financial and other resources, more established market positions, lower costs of capital, labor and material than we do.  Homebuilders compete for, among other things, desirable land, financing, raw materials, skilled labor and purchasers.  We compete for residential sales on the basis of a number of interrelated factors, including location, reputation, amenities, design, quality and price, with numerous homebuilders, including some homebuilders with greater financial resources and/or lower costs than us.  Increased competition could also reduce the number of homes we deliver, reducing our revenues, or cause us to accept reduced margins to maintain sales volumes.  A reduction in our revenue or margins due to competitive factors could affect our ability to service our debt, including the credit facilities. Risks Related to Contract Drilling Segment Demand for water well drilling and/or pump installation is volatile.  A decrease in demand for our services could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. Demand for services is highly dependent upon land development activities in the state of Hawaii.  As also noted above, the real estate development industry is cyclical in nature and is particularly vulnerable to shifts in local, regional, and national economic conditions outside of our control such as interest rates, housing demand, population growth, employment levels and job growth and property taxes.  A decrease in water well drilling and/or pump installation contracts will result in decreased revenues and operating results. 28Table of Contents A significant portion of our contract drilling business is dependent on municipalities and a decline in municipal spending could adversely impact our business. A significant portion of our contract drilling division revenues is derived from water and infrastructure contracts with governmental entities or agencies.  Reduced tax revenues and governmental budgets may limit spending by local governments which in turn will affect the demand for our services.  Material reductions in spending by a significant number of local governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial position. Our contract drilling operations face significant competition. We face competition for our services from a variety of competitors.  Many of our competitors utilize drilling rigs that drill as quickly as our equipment but require less labor.  Our strategy is to compete based on pricing and to a lesser degree, quality of service.  If we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors, our financial results could be adversely affected. The loss of or damage to key vendor, customer or sub-contractor relationships would adversely affect our operations. Our business is dependent on our relationships with key vendors, customers and subcontractors.  The loss of or damage to any of our key relationships could negatively affect our business. Awarding of contracts is dependent upon our ability to obtain contract bid and performance bonds from insurers. Although the Company has not experienced difficulties in obtaining such bonds in the past, there can be no assurance that our ability to obtain such bonds will continue on the same basis as the past.  Additionally, bonding insurance rates may increase and have an impact on our ability to win competitive bids, which could have a corresponding material impact on contract drilling operating results. The contracts in our backlog are subject to change orders and cancellation. Our backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under contracts that have been started and new contracts not yet started.  Our contracts are subject to change orders and cancellations, and such changes could adversely affect our operations. The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business. The occurrence of a natural disaster in Hawaii such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete our contracts. 29Table of Contents Entity-Wide Risks The continued economic slowdown may have impacts on our business and financial condition that we currently cannot predict. The economic slowdown has affected demand for luxury real estate and water well drilling and pump installation services in the state of Hawaii, and demand for oil and natural gas.  The ongoing economic slowdown may have further impacts on our business and our financial condition, and we may face additional challenges if economic conditions do not improve.  Our ability to access the capital and credit markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to raise funds, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions.  A further deterioration or continuation of these conditions will have an adverse impact on our operations and financial condition and results. We are reliant upon future cash flows from operations, land investment segment percentage of sales proceeds, and available credit as sources of liquidity.  If estimated cash inflows do not occur timely or are less than current expectations, our liquidity may be negatively impacted. In addition to cash flows from oil and natural gas, residential real estate and contract drilling operations, we rely upon land investment segment percentage of sales payment proceeds as a source of liquidity.  However, oil and natural gas prices have been historically volatile and the timing and amount of land investment segment percentage of sales proceeds are unpredictable, may be sporadic, and are not under our control. We also have a credit facility with a Canadian bank that is denominated in Canadian dollars.  Any decreases in currency exchange rates affect the amount of credit available to us.  Furthermore, our real estate loan agreement contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants including a consolidated debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.20 to 1, a consolidated total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio not to exceed 1.85 to 1, and a maximum loan to value ratio.  Noncompliance with any of the ratios could result in the need to pay down a portion of the outstanding borrowings. Accordingly, if estimated cash inflows do not occur on a timely basis or are less than current expectations or if we are subject to reductions in available credit, our revenues, operating results, cash inflows and financial condition could be materially impacted. Our future level of indebtedness and the terms of our financing arrangements may adversely affect our operations, financial condition and limit our growth. At September 30, 2011, we had borrowings under our credit facility and real estate loan of approximately $24 million.  In the ordinary course of business, we may incur significant additional debt, to the extent permitted by our credit facility and loan, in order to fund future capital expenditures, acquisitions and homebuilding activities. The terms of our credit facility and real estate loan impose restrictions on our ability and, in some cases, the ability of our subsidiaries to take a number of actions that we may otherwise desire to take, including one or more of the following:·                incurring additional debt, including guarantees of indebtedness;·                making investments;·                creating liens on our assets; and·                selling assets. 30Table of Contents Our level of indebtedness and the covenants contained in our financing agreements could have important consequences.  For example, they could:·                limit our ability to obtain future financing, through equity offerings or debt financings, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, refinancing of indebtedness or general corporate and other activities;·                require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow for other purposes (i.e., working capital, capital expenditures, and other general business activities);·                limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, the changes in our business;·                subject us to higher costs and more restrictive covenants in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes, if additional financing is obtained;·                make us vulnerable to increases in interest rates as our credit facilities are subject to variable interest rates;·                detract from our ability to successfully withstand a downturn in our business or the economy generally;·                place us at a competitive disadvantage because we have more debt than some of our competitors; and·                make us more vulnerable to general economic downturns and adverse developments in our industries, especially declines in oil and natural gas prices, and the economy in general. We may incur additional debt, including significant secured indebtedness, or issue additional stock in order to fund capital expenditures, make future acquisitions, and develop our properties.  A higher level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our obligations.  Our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance.  General economic conditions, oil and natural gas prices and financial, business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance.  Many of these factors are beyond our control.  Factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through a refinancing of our debt include financial market conditions, the value of our assets and our performance at the time we need capital. In addition, our Canadian revolving credit facility is subject to periodic redetermination.  A decrease in the facility could require us to repay indebtedness in excess of the borrowing base, or we may need to further secure the lenders with additional collateral. The price of our common stock has been volatile and could continue to fluctuate substantially. The market price of our common stock has been volatile and could fluctuate based on a variety of factors, including:·                fluctuations in commodity prices;·                variations in results of operations;·                announcements by us and our competitors;·                legislative or regulatory changes;·                general trends in the industry;·                general market conditions; and·                analysts estimates and other events in the oil and natural gas industry. 31Table of Contents Failure to retain key personnel could hurt our operations. We require highly skilled and experienced personnel to operate our business.  In addition to competing in highly competitive industries, we compete in a highly competitive labor market.  Our business could be adversely affected by an inability to retain personnel or upward pressure on wages as a result of the highly competitive labor market. A small number of stockholders, including our executive officers, own a significant amount of our common stock and have influence over our business regardless of the opposition of other stockholders. As of September 30, 2011, two of our investors and our executive officers held approximately 45% of our common stock.  The interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders.  These stockholders, acting together, have significant influence over all matters submitted to our stockholders, including the election of our directors, and could accelerate, delay, deter or prevent a change of control of us.  These stockholders are able to exercise significant control over our business, policies and affairs. Adverse changes in actuarial assumptions used to calculate retirement plan costs due to economic or other factors, or lower returns on plan assets could adversely affect Barnwells results and financial condition. Retirement plan cash funding obligations and plan expenses and obligations are subject to a high degree of uncertainty and could increase in future years depending on numerous factors, including the performance of the financial markets, specifically the equity markets, and the levels of interest rates. We are involved as a passive minority-interest partner in joint ventures and are subject to risks associated with joint venture partnerships. We are involved as a passive minority-interest partner in joint venture relationships and may initiate future joint venture projects.  Entering into a joint venture as a passive minority-interest partner involves certain risks which include:·                the inability to exercise voting control over the joint venture;·                economic or business interests which are not aligned with our venture partners, including the holding period and timing of ultimate sale of the ventures underlying assets; and·                the inability for the venture partner to fulfill its commitments and obligations due to financial or other difficulties. General economic conditions in the lodging industry could adversely affect our financial results. We own a 1.5% passive minority interest in Hualalai Resort, which includes the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Kaupulehu, two golf courses and a clubhouse.  Soft economic conditions and reduced travel to North Kona, Hawaii could adversely affect these interests and, therefore, our financial results related to our investment.  The aforementioned properties are also subject to risks that generally relate to investments in commercial real estate, including governmental regulations, real estate, insurance, zoning, tax and eminent domain laws, the ongoing need for capital improvements to maintain or upgrade properties, fluctuations in real estate values, and the relative illiquidity of real estate compared to other investments. 32Table of Contents "
0,BRN,BARNWELL INDUSTRIES,2010-12-15,"ITEM 1A.       RISK FACTORS The business of Barnwell and its subsidiaries face numerous risks, including those set forth below or those described elsewhere in this Form 10-K or in Barnwells other filings with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only risks that Barnwell faces, nor are they necessarily listed in order of significance.  If any of the following risk factors should occur, our profitability, financial condition or liquidity could be materially impacted. Risks Related to Oil and Natural Gas Segment The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We compete for capital, acquisitions of reserves, undeveloped lands, skilled personnel, access to drilling rigs, service rigs and other equipment, access to processing facilities, pipeline capacity and in many other respects with a substantial number of other organizations, many of which may have greater technical and financial resources than we do. Some of these organizations explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas, carry on refining operations and market oil and other products on a worldwide basis.  As a result of these complementary activities, some of our competitors may have competitive resources that are greater and more diverse than ours.  Furthermore, many of our competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production, such as changing prices and production levels, the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations.  If our competitors are able to capitalize on these competitive resources, it could adversely affect our revenues. 17Table of Contents Oil and natural gas prices are volatile.  Our results of operations and financial condition are highly dependent on the prices of and demand for our oil and natural gas production. Oil and natural gas prices are volatile and have fluctuated widely during recent years in response to many factors that are beyond our control.  These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty, weather, worldwide political instability, foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the level of consumer product demand, government regulations and taxes, the price and availability of alternative fuels and the overall economic environment.  Any decline in oil or natural gas prices may have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, operating cash flows, borrowing ability, reserves, and the amount of capital that we are able to allocate for the development of oil and natural gas reserves and future growth. Energy prices are also subject to other political and regulatory actions outside our control, which may include changes in the policies of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries or other developments involving or affecting oil-producing countries, or actions or reactions of the government of the United States in anticipation of or in response to such developments. If oil and natural gas prices decrease, we may be required to reduce the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties. We follow the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our oil and natural gas properties.  Under this method, the net book value of properties less related deferred income taxes, may not exceed a calculated ceiling.  The ceiling is the estimated after tax future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas properties, discounted at 10% per year. In calculating discounted future net revenues, average first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas prices during the 12-month period ending in the reporting period are held constant, except for changes which are fixed and determinable by existing contracts. The excess, if any, of the net book value above the ceiling is required to be written off as an expense.  A significant decline in oil and natural gas prices from current levels, or other factors, without other mitigating circumstances, could result in reductions of the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties and an equivalent charge to earnings. An increase in operating costs or a decline in our production level could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Higher operating costs for our properties will directly decrease the amount of cash flow received by us.  Electricity, supplies, and labor costs are a few of the operating costs that are susceptible to material fluctuation.  A significant increase in operating costs could result in materially lower operating margin and cash flow. The level of production from our existing properties may decline at rates greater than anticipated due to unforeseen circumstances, many of which are beyond our control.  A significant decline in our production could result in materially lower revenues and cash flow. Our operating results are affected by our ability to market the oil and natural gas that we produce. Our business depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of natural gas gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities.  Canadian federal and provincial, as well as United States federal and state, regulation of oil and natural gas production, processing and transportation, tax and energy policies, general economic conditions, and changes in supply and demand could adversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas. If market factors change and inhibit the marketing of our production, overall production or realized prices may decline. 18Table of Contents We are not the operator and have limited influence over the operations of the majority of our oil and natural gas properties. We hold minority interests in the majority of our oil and natural gas properties.  As a result, we cannot control the pace of exploration or development, major decisions affecting the drilling of wells or the plan for development and production at non-operated properties, although contract provisions give Barnwell certain consent rights in some matters.  The operators influence over these matters can affect the pace at which we incur capital expenditures.  Additionally, as certain underlying joint venture data is not accessible to us, we depend on the operators at non-operated properties to provide us with reliable accounting information. Our operations are subject to domestic and foreign government regulation and other risks, particularly in Canada and the United States. Barnwells oil and natural gas operations are affected by political developments and laws and regulations, particularly in Canada and the United States, such as restrictions on production, restrictions on imports and exports, the maintenance of specified reserves, tax increases and retroactive tax claims, expropriation of property, cancellation of contract rights, environmental protection controls, environmental compliance requirements and laws pertaining to workers health and safety.  Further, the right to explore for and develop oil and natural gas on lands in Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia is controlled by the governments of each of those provinces.  Changes in royalties and other terms of provincial leases, permits and reservations may have a substantial effect on Barnwells operations. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from our operations in Canada.  In fiscal 2010, we derived approximately 69% of our oil and natural gas segment revenues from operations in Canada. Additionally, our ability to compete in the Canadian oil and natural gas industry may be adversely affected by governmental regulations or other policies that favor the awarding of contracts to contractors in which Canadian nationals have substantial ownership interests. Furthermore, we may face governmentally imposed restrictions or fees from time to time on the transfer of funds to the U.S. Government regulations control and often limit access to potential markets and impose extensive requirements concerning employee safety, environmental protection, pollution control and remediation of environmental contamination.  Environmental regulations, in particular, prohibit access to some markets and make others less economical, increase equipment and personnel costs and often impose liability without regard to negligence or fault.  In addition, governmental regulations may discourage our customers activities, reducing demand for our products and services. Compliance with foreign tax and other laws may adversely affect our operations. Tax and other laws and regulations are not always interpreted consistently among local, regional and national authorities. Income tax laws, other legislation or government incentive programs relating to the oil and natural gas industry may in the future be changed or interpreted in a manner that adversely affects us and our stockholders.  It is also possible that in the future we will be subject to disputes concerning taxation and other matters in Canada, including the manner in which we calculate our income for tax purposes, and these disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. 19Table of Contents We are dependent upon future discoveries or acquisitions of oil and natural gas to maintain our reserves. We actively explore for oil and natural gas reserves.  However, future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and may involve substantial costs.  Despite this uncertainty or potential cost, discoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production. As a result, future oil and natural gas reserves may be dependent on our success in exploiting existing properties and acquiring additional reserves.  If our access to capital becomes limited or unavailable, our ability to make the necessary capital investments to maintain or expand our oil and natural gas reserves will be impaired.  Additionally, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in developing additional reserves or acquiring additional reserves on terms that meet our investment objectives.  Without these reserve additions, our reserves will deplete and as a consequence, either production from, or the average reserve life of, our properties will decline. Actual reserves will vary from reserve estimates. Estimating reserves is inherently uncertain and the reserves estimation process involves significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data.  The reserve data and standardized measures set forth herein are only estimates. Ultimately, actual reserves attributable to our properties will vary from estimates, and those variations may be material.  The estimation of reserves involves a number of factors and assumptions, including, among others:· oil and natural gas prices as prescribed by the SEC;  · historical production from our wells compared with production rates from similar producing wells in the area;  · future commodity prices, production and development costs, royalties and capital expenditures;  · initial production rates;  · production decline rates;  · ultimate recovery of reserves;  · success of future development activities;  · marketability of production;  · effects of government regulation; and  · other government levies that may be imposed over the producing life of reserves.    If these factors, assumptions and prices prove to be inaccurate, actual results may vary materially from reserve estimates. Delays in business operations could adversely affect our distributions. In addition to the usual delays in payment by purchasers of oil and natural gas to the operators of our properties, and the delays of those operators in remitting payment to us, payments between any of these parties may also be delayed by:·                restrictions imposed by lenders;·                accounting delays; 20Table of Contents ·                delays in the sale or delivery of products;·                delays in the connection of wells to a gathering system;·                blowouts or other accidents;·                adjustments for prior periods;·                recovery by the operator of expenses incurred in the operation of the properties; and·                the establishment by the operator of reserves for these expenses. Any of these delays could expose us to additional third party credit risks. The industry in which we operate exposes us to potential liabilities that may not be covered by insurance. Our operations are subject to all of the risks associated with the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties, including the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, and the production and transportation of oil and natural gas.  These risks include encountering unexpected formations or pressures, premature declines of reservoirs, blow-outs, equipment failures and other accidents, cratering, sour gas releases, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, adverse weather conditions, pollution, other environmental risks, fires and spills.  A number of these risks could result in personal injury, loss of life, or environmental and other damage to our property or the property of others. While we maintain reserves for anticipated liabilities and carry various levels of insurance, we could be affected by civil, criminal, regulatory or administrative actions, claims or proceedings. We cannot fully protect against all of the risks listed above, nor are all of these risks insurable.  There is no assurance that any applicable insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability for the risks listed above.  We could face substantial losses if an event occurs for which we are not fully insured or are not indemnified against or a customer or insurer fails to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations.  In addition, there can be no assurance that insurance will continue to be available to cover any or all of these risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive. We may incur material costs to comply with or as a result of health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations. The oil and natural gas industry is subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to local, provincial and federal legislation.  A violation of that legislation may result in the imposition of fines or the issuance of clean up orders.  Legislation regulating the oil and natural gas industry may be changed to impose higher standards and potentially more costly obligations.  For example, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, known as the Kyoto Protocol, was ratified by the Canadian government in December 2002 and will require, among other things, significant reductions in greenhouse gases.  The impact of the Kyoto Protocol on us is uncertain and may result in significant additional costs for our future operations. Although we have recorded a provision in our financial statements relating to our estimated future environmental and reclamation obligations that we believe is reasonable, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to satisfy our actual future environmental and reclamation obligations. 21Table of Contents We are not fully insured against certain environmental risks, either because such insurance is not available or because of high premium costs.  In particular, insurance against risks from environmental pollution occurring over time, as opposed to sudden and catastrophic damages, is not available on economically reasonable terms.  Accordingly, any site reclamation or abandonment costs actually incurred in the ordinary course of business in a specific period could negatively impact our cash flow.  Should we be unable to fully fund the cost of remedying an environmental problem, we might be required to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy. We may have difficulty financing our planned capital expenditures, which could have an adverse affect on our business. We make and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our exploration and development projects. Without adequate capital resources, our drilling and other activities may be limited and our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.  We may not be able to secure necessary financing on reasonable terms or at all and financing may not continue to be available to us under our existing financing arrangements.  If capital resources are unavailable, we may curtail our drilling, development and other activities or be forced to sell some of our assets under untimely or unfavorable terms.  Any such curtailment or sale could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Unforeseen title defects may result in a loss of entitlement to production and reserves. Although we conduct title reviews in accordance with industry practice prior to any purchase of resource assets or property, such reviews do not guarantee that an unforeseen defect in the chain of title will not arise and defeat our title to the purchased assets.  If such a defect were to occur, our entitlement to the production from such purchased assets could be jeopardized. Risks Related to Land Investment Segment The real estate investment industry continues to experience a slowdown that may persist for an indefinite period.  This downturn in economic conditions could adversely affect our business, results of operations and stockholders equity. The real estate investment industry is cyclical in nature and is particularly vulnerable to shifts in local, regional, and national economic conditions outside of our control such as interest rates, housing demand, population growth, employment levels, job growth and property taxes.  Further, a weakening of the economic drivers in Hawaii, which include tourism, military spending, construction starts and employment, and a decrease in market demand adversely impacted the level of real estate activity in Hawaii.  The industry has experienced a significant decrease in demand for new homes since 2007 and this trend may continue for an extended period of time.  Economic conditions in the United States have also weakened, which puts continued pressure on consumer confidence for residential real estate.  These challenging market conditions are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and, in the near term, these conditions may further deteriorate.  We expect that continued weakness in the industry could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 22Table of Contents Considerable economic and political uncertainties currently exist that could have adverse effects on consumer buying habits, construction costs, availability of labor and materials and other factors affecting us and the real estate industry in general.  Significant expenditures associated with investment in real estate, such as real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance costs and debt payments, cannot generally be reduced even though changes in Hawaiis or the nations economy may cause a decrease in revenues from our properties. Our real estate business is concentrated in the state of Hawaii.  As a result, our financial results are dependent on the economic growth and health of Hawaii, particularly the island of Hawaii. Barnwells land investment segment is affected by the condition of Hawaiis real estate market.  The Hawaii real estate market is affected by Hawaiis economy and Hawaiis tourism industry, as well as the United States economy in general.  Any future cash flows from Barnwells land development activities are subject to, among other factors, the level of real estate activity and prices, the demand for new housing and second homes on the island of Hawaii, the rate of increase in the cost of building materials and labor, the introduction of building code modifications, changes to zoning laws, and the level of confidence in Hawaiis economy.  The future economic growth in certain portions of the island of Hawaii may be adversely affected if its infrastructure, such as roads, airports, medical facilities and schools, are not improved to meet increased demand. There can be no assurance that these improvements will occur. The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business. The occurrence of a natural disaster in Hawaii such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop and sell properties or realize income from our projects. The occurrence of a natural disaster could also cause increases in property and flood insurance rates and deductibles, which could reduce demand for our properties. Increases in interest rates, tightening of lending standards and decreases, limitations or restrictions in the availability of mortgage financing and other economic factors outside our control, such as consumer confidence and declines in employment levels could lead to slowed home sales, which could adversely affect our revenues and earnings. The United States residential mortgage market continues to experience disruption.  Mortgage interest rates have been experiencing significant volatility and contributed to the challenging market conditions faced by us and the industry. In addition, as a result of increased default rates and other factors, the willingness of many lenders to make home mortgage loans has decreased and lenders have tightened their lending standards. The volatility in interest rates, the decrease in the willingness of lenders to make home mortgage loans, and the tightening of lending standards have made it more difficult for some potential buyers to finance the purchase of our homes.  Potential buyers may not be able to obtain acceptable financing to purchase residential lots within the Kaupulehu area, leading to further declines in the market for homes.  Any limitations or restrictions on the availability of mortgage financing or increases in mortgage interest rates could reduce residential lot sales, thereby reducing our revenues and earnings.  Even if potential buyers do not need financing, changes in interest rates and mortgage availability could make it harder for them to sell their existing homes to potential buyers who need financing.  Any limitations or restrictions on the availability of mortgage financing, further interest rate increases or limits on the deductibility of home mortgages could adversely affect our sales, which would reduce our revenues. 23Table of Contents Our business is subject to extensive regulation which makes it difficult and expensive for us to conduct our operations. We are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to land use and development and to environmental compliance and permitting obligations, including those related to the use, storage, discharge, emission, and disposal of hazardous materials. Any failure to comply with these laws could result in capital or operating expenditures or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations that could adversely affect present and future operations, or jeopardize our ability to sell the leasehold interest currently held. Receipt of future percentage of sales payments is dependent upon the developers continued efforts to develop and market the property. We are entitled to receive future payments based on a percentage of the sales prices of residential homes and lots within approximately 870 acres in the Kaupulehu area.  However, in order to collect such percentage of sales payments we are reliant upon an unaffiliated third party developer to continue to develop and market the homes and lots.  The receipt of future percentage of sales payments could be jeopardized if the developer fails to proceed with development and marketing of the property. If required land use entitlements are not obtained at reasonable costs, or at all, our operating results could be adversely affected. We hold the leasehold interest to approximately 1,000 acres of vacant land that is currently zoned conservation.  Our success in selling this interest may be contingent upon obtaining the necessary reclassification from the State of Hawaii Land Use Commission and county of Hawaii.  Obtaining the necessary reclassification and ministerial approvals is often difficult, costly and may take several years, or more, to complete. Delays or failures to obtain the necessary reclassification approvals may adversely affect our financial results. Environmental and other regulations may have an adverse effect on our business. Our properties are subject to federal, state and local environmental regulations and restrictions that may impose significant limitations.  In most cases, approval to develop requires multiple permits which involve a long, uncertain and costly regulatory process. The value of our lot acquisition rights could be impaired if the developer of the property is unable to obtain required land use entitlements or successfully negotiate development terms and agreements. We hold acquisition rights to 14 lots in agricultural-zoned leasehold lands in the upland area of Kaupulehu (Mauka Lands) situated between the Queen Kaahumanu Highway and the Mamalahoa Highway at Kaupulehu, North Kona, island and state of Hawaii.  The lot acquisition rights give us the right to purchase residential lots which may be developed on the Mauka Lands.  The ability to purchase residential lots and the value of such lots in the future is contingent upon the developer of the property obtaining the necessary land use reclassification, zoning and development approvals from regulatory entities.  Obtaining the necessary reclassification and ministerial approvals is often difficult, costly and may take several years, or more, to complete. Delays or failures to obtain the necessary reclassification and rezoning approvals may adversely affect our financial results.  Our ability to purchase lots and the value of such lots is also contingent upon the ability of the developer of the property to successfully negotiate development terms and agreements within the Mauka Lands.  If the developer is unsuccessful in such negotiations, our ability to purchase residential lots in the Mauka Lands would be impaired. 24Table of Contents The market value of our real estate interests could decline, which may require write-downs of the carrying value of our residential lots held for investment to its estimated fair value.  Any write-downs would negatively impact our results of operations. The risk of owning undeveloped lots can be substantial and we may have bought lots which we cannot profitably sell.  The market value of residential lots can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing economic market conditions. Prevailing market conditions may significantly influence the market value of our residential parcels held for investment.  In the event of changes in economic or market conditions, we may have to sell the residential lots at lower margins or at a loss.  Furthermore, if the market conditions continue to deteriorate, we may be required to record write-downs of the carrying value of our residential parcels held for investment.  Such write-downs would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.  Risks Related to Residential Real Estate Segment The homebuilding industry continues to experience a slowdown that may persist for an indefinite period.  This downturn in economic conditions could adversely affect our business, results of operations and stockholders equity. The homebuilding industry historically has been cyclical and is sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as employment levels, consumer confidence, consumer income, availability of financing and interest rate levels.  Adverse changes in any of these conditions generally, or in the market in which we operate, could decrease demand and pricing for new homes or result in customer cancellations of pending contracts, which could adversely affect the number of home deliveries we make or reduce the prices we can charge for homes, either of which could result in a reduction in our revenues or deterioration of our margins. The homebuilding industry has experienced a significant and sustained downturn characterized by decreased demand for new homes, an oversupply of both new and resale home inventories, including foreclosed homes; aggressive price competition among homebuilders, including increased incentives for home sales; and a more restrictive mortgage lending environment.  Economic conditions in the United States have also weakened recently, which puts continued pressure on consumer confidence for residential real estate.  These challenging market conditions are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and, in the near term, these conditions may further deteriorate.  Continued weakness in the homebuilding industry could further adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are reliant upon sales of homes as a source of liquidity.  If we are unable to sell the homes within a reasonable timeframe, our revenues, operating results, cash inflows and financial condition could be materially impacted. Barnwell currently owns two luxury residences held for sale in the Lot 4A Increment I area of Kaupulehu, North Kona, Hawaii. 25Table of Contents The acquisition of the parcels and home construction costs on the luxury homes were financed through a bank revolving credit facility and subsequently modified under a non-revolving credit facility. Under the modified agreement, we are required to make a scheduled principal payment of $500,000 per quarter. If we sell one of the homes, the quarterly payment will be reduced to $250,000 per quarter.  The entire unpaid principal balance and any accrued interest is due in full in February 2012, unless we sell a home and lot before then, in which case we will be required to make a principal payment upon the sale of a home and lot in an amount equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the net sales proceeds of the home and lot or (2) $1,500,000 for each of the two lots and $7,000,000 for each of the two homes. The timing and amount of residential home sales are unpredictable and may be sporadic.  The inability to sell the homes within a reasonable timeframe will lead to additional interest costs.  Additionally, if we are unable to sell the homes within a reasonable timeframe, we will need to refinance the debt, obtain alternative terms or sources of financing, liquidate investments and/or operating assets, or reduce oil and natural gas capital expenditures to make the required cash outflows.  This would negatively impact our liquidity. Furthermore, if estimated cash inflows from home sales do not occur on a timely basis or are less than current expectations, our revenues, operating results, cash inflows and financial condition could be materially impacted. If we are unable to sell the homes by February 2012, the due date of the facility, and we are unable to refinance our debt, we will need to obtain alternative terms or sources of financing or liquidate investments and/or operating assets to repay the facility on its due date. We have limited experience in the homebuilding industry. Homebuilding is a new business segment for us and we are relying to a material extent on our business partners to help us execute our business plan. We may need financing to fund our future real estate development activities.  If we are unable to obtain sufficient financing or such financing is obtained on adverse terms, we may not be able to operate our business as planned, which could adversely affect our results of operations and future growth. The real estate development industry is capital intensive and homebuilding requires significant up-front expenditures to acquire land and begin development.  We will need to establish funding sources to finance any future land acquisition capital expenditures.  If such sources are not sufficient, we would seek additional capital in the form of debt or equity financing from a variety of potential sources, including additional bank financing, joint venture partner financing, and/or securities offerings. The amount and types of indebtedness which we may incur are limited by the terms of the agreements governing our existing debt.  In addition, the availability of borrowed funds to be utilized for land acquisition, development and construction may be greatly reduced, and the lending community may require increased amounts of equity to be invested in a project by borrowers in connection with both new loans and the extension of existing loans. The failure to obtain sufficient capital to fund our planned capital and other expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business. 26Table of Contents Our operating results from homebuilding are expected to be variable. Due to the cyclical nature of the real estate development industry, we expect to experience variability in our future operating results on a quarterly and an annual basis.  Factors expected to contribute to this variability include, among other things:·                the timing of land acquisitions and permitting;·                the timing of home closings, land sales and level of home sales;·                our ability to continue to acquire additional land or options thereon on acceptable terms;·                the condition of the real estate market and the general economy; and·                delays in construction due to natural disasters, adverse weather, reduced contractor availability and strikes. For example, the timing of land acquisitions and permitting impacts our ability to pursue the development of new housing projects in accordance with our business plan.  If the timing of land acquisitions, zoning or regulatory approvals is delayed, we will be delayed in our ability to develop housing projects, which would likely decrease our backlog.  Furthermore, these delays could result in a decrease in our revenues and earnings for the periods in which the delays occur and possibly subsequent periods until the planned housing projects can be completed.  A delay in home closings due to natural disasters, adverse weather or contractor availability would have a similar impact on revenues and earnings for the period in which the delays occur.  Further, revenues may increase in subsequent periods over what would normally be expected as a result of increased home closings as the delays described above are resolved. Changes in the government regulations applicable to homebuilders could restrict our business activities, increase our operating expenses and cause our revenues to decline. Regulatory requirements applicable to homebuilders could cause us to incur significant liabilities and operating expenses and could restrict our business activities.  We are subject to local, state and federal statutes and rules regulating, among other things, certain developmental matters, building and site design, and matters concerning the protection of worker health and safety, and the environment.  Our operating expenses may be increased by governmental regulations, such as building permit allocation ordinances, impact and other fees and taxes, which may be imposed to defray the cost of providing certain governmental services and improvements. Other governmental regulations, such as building moratoriums and no growth or slow growth initiatives, which may be adopted in communities which have developed rapidly, may cause delays in our home projects or otherwise restrict our business activities resulting in reductions in our revenues.  Any delay or refusal to grant us necessary licenses, permits or approvals from government agencies could cause substantial increases to development costs or cause us to abandon the project and to sell the affected land at a potential loss, which in turn could harm our operating results. Our residential real estate segment is dependent on the continued availability and satisfactory performance of our building contractors, which, if unavailable, could have a material adverse effect on our business. 27Table of Contents We conduct our construction operations through unaffiliated building contractors.  As a consequence, we depend on the continued availability of and satisfactory performance by the contractors for the construction of our homes. There may not be sufficient availability of and satisfactory performance by the contractors.  If the contractors quality of work is not sufficient, our ability to construct homes on the schedule we have planned would be affected. This could result in an increase in our costs to construct homes in a timely manner, which could result in an increase in our overall costs and thus a decline in our margins and in our net income. Further, non-timely completion of work could affect our ability to sell homes based upon our projected timeline thus possibly affecting our ability to obtain additional financing to continue our homebuilding efforts.font> Shortages of labor or materials and/or increases in the price of materials could delay construction or increase the cost of home construction thereby reducing our sales and earnings. The homebuilding business has from time to time experienced building material and labor shortages, as well as volatility in the prices of certain materials, including lumber, framing, drywall and cement, which are significant components of home construction costs.  These labor and material shortages can be more severe during periods of strong demand for housing or during periods where the area in which we operate experiences natural disasters that have a significant impact on existing residential and commercial structures.  Shortages and price increases could cause delays in and increase our costs of home construction, which in turn could harm our operating results. The market value of our real estate interests could decline, which may require write-downs of the carrying value of our real estate held for sale to its estimated fair value. Any write-downs would negatively impact our results of operations. The risk of owning developed and undeveloped land can be substantial for homebuilders. Homebuilding requires that we acquire land for replacement and expansion of land inventory within our existing and new markets.  The risks inherent in purchasing and developing land increase as consumer demand for housing decreases.  Thus, we may have bought and developed land which we cannot profitably sell or on which we cannot profitably build and sell homes.  The market value of land, buildable lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing economic market conditions. It is possible that the measures we employ to manage inventory risks will not be successful and as a result our operations may suffer.  In addition, inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing market.  Prevailing market conditions may significantly influence the market value of our real estate held for sale.  In the event of changes in economic or market conditions, we may have to sell homes or land inventory at lower margins or at a loss.  Furthermore, if the market conditions continue to deteriorate, we will be required to record write-downs of the carrying value of our real estate held for sale.  Such write-downs would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Severe weather and other natural conditions or disasters may disrupt or delay construction and may impair the value of our real estate property. Severe weather and other natural conditions or disasters, such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, volcanic activity, droughts, floods, and heavy or prolonged rain, can negatively affect our operations by requiring us to delay or halt construction or to perform potentially costly repairs to our projects under construction and to unsold homes.  Further, these conditions can delay home closings, adversely affect the cost or availability of materials or labor, or impair the value of the property on a temporary or permanent basis.  To the extent our insurance is not adequate to cover business interruption losses or repair costs resulting from these events, our total earned revenues and earnings may be adversely affected. 28Table of Contents The homebuilding industry is highly competitive and, with more limited resources than some of our competitors, we may not be able to compete effectively. The homebuilding industry is highly competitive. We face competition from other developers on the island of Hawaii and from other luxury residential properties in Hawaii and the mainland United States.  In many cases, our competitors have greater financial and other resources, more established market positions, lower costs of capital, labor and material than we do.  Homebuilders compete for, among other things, desirable land, financing, raw materials, skilled labor and purchasers.  We compete for residential sales on the basis of a number of interrelated factors, including location, reputation, amenities, design, quality and price, with numerous homebuilders, including some homebuilders with greater financial resources and/or lower costs than us.  Increased competition could also reduce the number of homes we deliver, reducing our revenues, or cause us to accept reduced margins to maintain sales volumes. A reduction in our revenue or margins due to competitive factors could affect our ability to service our debt, including the credit facilities.  Risks Related to Contract Drilling Segment Demand for water well drilling and/or pump installation is volatile.  A decrease in demand for our services could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. Demand for services is highly dependent upon land development activities in the state of Hawaii.  As also noted above, the real estate development industry is cyclical in nature and is particularly vulnerable to shifts in local, regional, and national economic conditions outside of our control such as interest rates, housing demand, population growth, employment levels and job growth and property taxes.  If we experience a decrease in water well drilling and/or pump installation contracts, we may experience decreased revenues and operating results. A significant portion of our contract drilling business is dependent on municipalities and a decline in municipal spending could adversely impact our business. A significant portion of our contract drilling division revenues is derived from water and infrastructure contracts with governmental entities or agencies.  Reduced tax revenues and governmental budgets may limit spending by local governments which in turn will affect the demand for our services.  Material reductions in spending by a significant number of local governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial position. Our contract drilling operations face significant competition. We face competition for our services from a variety of competitors.  Many of our competitors utilize drilling rigs that drill as quickly as our equipment but require less labor.  Our strategy is to compete based on pricing and to a lesser degree, quality of service. If we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors, our financial results could be adversely affected. 29Table of Contents The loss of or damage to key vendor, customer or sub-contractor relationships would adversely affect our operations. Our business is dependent on our relationships with key vendors, customers and subcontractors.  The loss of or damage to any of our key relationships could negatively affect our business. Awarding of contracts is dependent upon our ability to obtain contract bid and performance bonds from insurers. Although the Company has not experienced difficulties in obtaining such bonds in the past, there can be no assurance that our ability to obtain such bonds will continue on the same basis as the past. Additionally, bonding insurance rates may increase and have an impact on our ability to win competitive bids, which could have a corresponding material impact on contract drilling operating results. The contracts in our backlog are subject to change orders and cancellation. Our backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under contracts that have been started and new contracts not yet started.  Our contracts are subject to change orders and can be cancelled and if our estimated backlog is reduced significantly, this could adversely affect our operations. The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business. The occurrence of a natural disaster in Hawaii such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete our contracts. Entity-Wide Risks The continued economic slowdown may have impacts on our business and financial condition that we currently cannot predict. The ongoing economic slowdown may have further impacts on our business and our financial condition, and we may face additional challenges if economic conditions do not improve.  Our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to raise capital, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions.  The economic situation could adversely affect the demand for real estate development activities in the state of Hawaii which in turn could cause a decline in the water well drilling and/or pump installation services required. Furthermore, weak market conditions could cause a deeper decrease in demand for luxury homes.  Additionally, economic conditions could lead to a further reduction in demand for oil and natural gas, or lower prices for natural gas and oil, or both, which could have a negative impact on our revenues. 30Table of Contents We are reliant upon future cash flows from operations, land investment segment development rights and percentage of sales proceeds, and available credit as a source of liquidity.  If estimated cash inflows do not occur timely or are less than current expectations, our liquidity may be negatively impacted. In addition to cash flows from oil and natural gas, residential real estate and contract drilling operations, we rely upon land investment segment development rights and percentage of sales payment proceeds as a source of liquidity.  However, oil and natural gas prices have been historically volatile and the timing and amount of land investment segment percentage of sales proceeds are unpredictable, may be sporadic, and are not under our control.  Development rights proceeds, on the other hand, are scheduled but there is no assurance that the final development rights option monies will be received. We also have a credit facility with a Canadian bank that is denominated in Canadian dollars.  Any decreases in currency exchange rates affect the amount of credit available to us.  Furthermore, our real estate credit facilitys loan advance limitation is subject to the underlying securitys appraised value.  Any decreases in the appraised value of the underlying security could result in the need to pay down a portion of the outstanding borrowings. Accordingly, if estimated cash inflows do not occur on a timely basis or are less than current expectations or if we are subject to reductions in available credit, our revenues, operating results, cash inflows and financial condition could be materially impacted. Our future level of indebtedness and the terms of our financing arrangements may adversely affect our operations, financial condition and limit our growth. At September 30, 2010, we had borrowings under our credit facilities of approximately $26 million.  In the ordinary course of business, we may incur significant additional debt, to the extent permitted by our credit facilities, in order to fund future capital expenditures, acquisitions and homebuilding activities. The terms of our credit facilities impose restrictions on our ability and, in some cases, the ability of our subsidiaries to take a number of actions that we may otherwise desire to take, including one or more of the following:·                incurring additional debt, including guarantees of indebtedness;·                making investments;·                creating liens on our assets; and·                selling assets. Our level of indebtedness and the covenants contained in our financing agreements could have important consequences.  For example, it could:·                limit our ability to obtain future financing, through equity offerings or debt financings, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, refinancing of indebtedness or general corporate and other activities;·                require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow for other purposes (i.e., working capital, capital expenditures, and other general business activities);·                limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, the changes in our business; 31Table of Contents ·                subject us to higher costs and more restrictive covenants in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes, if additional financing is obtained;·                make us vulnerable to increases in interest rates as our credit facilities are subject to variable interest rates;·                detract from our ability to successfully withstand a downturn in our business or the economy generally;·                place us at a competitive disadvantage because we have more debt than some of our competitors; and·                make us more vulnerable to general economic downturns and adverse developments in our industries, especially declines in oil and natural gas prices, and the economy in general. We may incur additional debt, including significant secured indebtedness, or issue additional stock in order to fund capital expenditures, make future acquisitions, and develop our properties. A higher level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our obligations.  Our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance.  General economic conditions, oil and natural gas prices and financial, business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance.  Many of these factors are beyond our control.  Factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through a refinancing of our debt include financial market conditions, the value of our assets and our performance at the time we need capital. In addition, our Canadian revolving credit facility is subject to periodic redetermination.  A decrease in the facility could require us to repay indebtedness in excess of the borrowing base, or we may need to further secure the lenders with additional collateral. Borrowings under the real estate non-revolving credit facility are subject to a loan advance limitation based on the appraised value of the underlying security.  The loan advance limitation may be reduced as a result of a decrease in appraised value of the underlying security.  If borrowings under the facility exceed the loan advance limitation, Barnwell will be required to make debt repayments in the amount of the excess. The price of our common stock has been volatile and could continue to fluctuate substantially. The market price of our common stock has been volatile and could fluctuate based on a variety of factors, including:·                fluctuations in commodity prices;·                variations in results of operations;·                announcements by us and our competitors;·                legislative or regulatory changes;·                general trends in the industry;·                general market conditions; and·                analysts estimates and other events in the oil and natural gas industry. Failure to retain key personnel could hurt our operations. We require highly skilled and experienced personnel to operate our business.  In addition to competing in highly competitive industries, we compete in a highly competitive labor market.  Our business could be adversely affected by an inability to retain personnel or upward pressure on wages as a result of the highly competitive labor market. 32Table of Contents A small number of stockholders, including our executive officers, own a significant amount of our common stock and have influence over our business regardless of the opposition of other stockholders. As of September 30, 2010, two of our investors and our executive officers held approximately 45% of our common stock.  The interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders.  These stockholders, acting together, have significant influence over all matters submitted to our stockholders, including the election of our directors, and could accelerate, delay, deter or prevent a change of control of us.  These stockholders are able to exercise significant control over our business, policies and affairs. Adverse changes in actuarial assumptions used to calculate retirement plan costs due to economic or other factors, or lower returns on plan assets could adversely affect Barnwells results and financial condition. Retirement plan cash funding obligations and plan expenses and obligations are subject to a high degree of uncertainty and could increase in future years depending on numerous factors, including the performance of the financial markets, specifically the equity markets, and the levels of interest rates. We are involved as a passive minority-interest partner in joint ventures and are subject to risks associated with joint venture partnerships. We are involved as a passive minority-interest partner in joint venture relationships and may initiate future joint venture projects.  Entering into a joint venture as a passive minority-interest partner involves certain risks which include:·                the inability to exercise voting control over the joint venture;·                economic or business interests which are not aligned with our venture partners, including the holding period and timing of ultimate sale of the ventures underlying assets; and·                the inability for the venture partner to fulfill its commitments and obligations due to financial or other difficulties. General economic conditions in the lodging industry could adversely affect our financial results. We own a 1.5% passive minority interest in Hualalai Resort, which includes the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Kaupulehu, two golf courses and a clubhouse, and a 1.5% passive minority interest in the Kona Village Resort, an 80-acre oceanfront hotel property.  Soft economic conditions and reduced travel to North Kona, Hawaii could adversely affect these interests and, therefore, our financial results related to our investment.  The aforementioned properties are also subject to risks that generally relate to investments in commercial real estate, including governmental regulations, real estate, insurance, zoning, tax and eminent domain laws, the ongoing need for capital improvements to maintain or upgrade properties, fluctuations in real estate values, and the relative illiquidity of real estate compared to other investments. 33Table of Contents "
2,BRN,BARNWELL INDUSTRIES,2009-12-15,"ITEM 1A.         RISK FACTORS The business of Barnwell and its subsidiaries facenumerous risks, including those set forth below or those described elsewhere inthis Form 10-K or in Barnwells other filings with the SEC.  The risks described below are not the onlyrisks that Barnwell faces, nor are they necessarily listed in order ofsignificance.  If any of the followingrisk factors should occur, our profitability, financial condition or liquiditycould be materially impacted.  Risks Related to Oil and Natural Gas Segment The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We compete for capital, acquisitions of reserves,undeveloped lands, skilled personnel, access to drilling rigs, service rigs andother equipment, access to processing facilities, pipeline capacity and in manyother respects with a substantial number of other organizations, many of whichmay have greater technical and financial resources than we do.  Some of these organizations explore for,develop and produce oil and natural gas, carry on refining operations andmarket oil and other products on a worldwide basis.  As a result of these complementaryactivities, some of our competitors may have competitive resources that aregreater and more diverse than ours. Furthermore, many of our competitors may have a competitive advantagewhen responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gasproduction, such as changing prices and production levels, the cost andavailability of alternative fuels and the application of governmentregulations.  If our competitors are ableto capitalize on these competitive resources, it could adversely affect ourrevenues. Oil and natural gas prices are volatile.  Our results of operations and financialcondition are highly dependent on the prices of and demand for our oil andnatural gas production. Oil and natural gas prices are volatile and havefluctuated widely during recent years in response to many factors that arebeyond our control.  These factorsinclude, but are not limited to, minor changes in supply and demand, marketuncertainty, weather, worldwide political instability, foreign supply of oiland natural gas, the level of consumer product demand, government regulationsand taxes, the price and availability of alternative fuels and the overalleconomic environment.  Any decline in oilor natural gas prices may have a material adverse effect on our operations,financial condition, operating cash flows, borrowing ability, reserves, and theamount of capital that we are able to allocate for the development of oil andnatural gas reserves and future growth. 20Table of Contents Energy prices are also subject to other politicaland regulatory actions outside our control, which may include changes in thepolicies of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries or otherdevelopments involving or affecting oil-producing countries, or actions orreactions of the government of the United States in anticipation of or inresponse to such developments. If oil and natural gasprices decrease, we may be required to take write-downs of the carrying valueof our oil and natural gas properties. We follow the full cost method of accounting forcosts related to our oil and natural gas properties.  Under this method, the net book value ofproperties less related deferred income taxes, may not exceed a calculated ceiling.  The ceiling is the estimated after tax futurenet revenues from proved oil and natural gas properties, discounted at 10% peryear.  In calculating discounted futurenet revenues, oil and natural gas prices in effect at the time of thecalculation are held constant, except for changes which are fixed anddeterminable by existing contracts.  Thefull cost ceiling is evaluated at the end of each quarter using the prices foroil and natural gas at that date.  Theexcess, if any, of the net book value above the ceiling is required to bewritten off as an expense.  A significantdecline in oil and natural gas prices from current levels, or other factors, withoutother mitigating circumstances, could result in reductions of the carryingvalue of our oil and natural gas properties and an equivalent charge toearnings. An increase in operating costs or a decline in our production levelcould have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financialcondition. Higher operating costs for our properties willdirectly decrease the amount of cash flow received by us.  Electricity, supplies, and labor costs are afew of the operating costs that are susceptible to material fluctuation.  A significant increase in operating costscould result in materially lower operating margin and cash flow. The level of production from our existing propertiesmay decline at rates greater than anticipated due to unforeseen circumstances,many of which are beyond our control.  Asignificant decline in our production could result in materially lower revenuesand cash flow. Our operating results are affected by our ability tomarket the oil and natural gas that we produce. Our business depends in part upon the availability,proximity and capacity of natural gas gathering systems, pipelines andprocessing facilities.  Canadian federaland provincial, as well as United States federal and state, regulation of oiland natural gas production, processing and transportation, tax and energypolicies, general economic conditions, and changes in supply and demand couldadversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas.  If market factors change and inhibit the marketingof our production, overall production or realized prices may decline. We are not the operator and have limited influenceover the operations of the majority of our oil and natural gas properties. We hold minority interests in the majority of ouroil and natural gas properties.  As aresult, we cannot control the pace of exploration or development or majordecisions affecting the drilling of wells or the plan for development andproduction at non-operated properties, although contract provisions giveBarnwell certain consent rights in some matters.  The operators influence over these matterscan affect the pace at which we incur capital expenditures.  Additionally, as certain underlying jointventure data is not accessible to us, we depend on the operators atnon-operated properties to provide us with reliable accounting information. 21Table of Contents Our operations are subject to domestic and foreign governmentregulation and other risks, particularly in Canada and the United States. Barnwells oil and natural gas operations areaffected by political developments and laws and regulations, particularly inCanada and the United States, such as restrictions on production, restrictionson imports and exports, the maintenance of specified reserves, tax increasesand retroactive tax claims, expropriation of property, cancellation of contractrights, environmental protection controls, environmental compliancerequirements and laws pertaining to workers health and safety.  Further, the right to explore for and developoil and natural gas on lands in Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia iscontrolled by the governments of each of those provinces.  Changes in royalties and other terms ofprovincial leases, permits and reservations may have a substantial effect onBarnwells operations.  We derive asignificant portion of our revenues from our operations in Canada.  In fiscal 2009, we derived approximately 78%of our operating revenues from operations in Canada. Additionally, our ability to compete in the Canadianoil and natural gas industry may be adversely affected by governmentalregulations or other policies that favor the awarding of contracts tocontractors in which Canadian nationals have substantial ownershipinterests.  Furthermore, we may facegovernmentally imposed restrictions or fees from time to time on the transferof funds to the U.S. Government regulations control and often limitaccess to potential markets and impose extensive requirements concerningemployee safety, environmental protection, pollution control and remediation ofenvironmental contamination. Environmental regulations, in particular, prohibit access to somemarkets and make others less economical, increase equipment and personnel costsand often impose liability without regard to negligence or fault.  In addition, governmental regulations maydiscourage our customers activities, reducing demand for our products andservices. Compliance with foreign tax and other laws may adversely affect ouroperations. Tax and other laws and regulations are not alwaysinterpreted consistently among local, regional and national authorities.  Income tax laws, other legislation orgovernment incentive programs relating to the oil and natural gas industry mayin the future be changed or interpreted in a manner that adversely affects usand our stockholders.  It is also possiblethat in the future we will be subject to disputes concerning taxation and othermatters in Canada, including the manner in which we calculate our income fortax purposes, and these disputes could have a material adverse effect on ourfinancial performance. We are dependent upon future discoveries or acquisitions of oil andnatural gas to maintain our reserves. We actively explore for oil and natural gasreserves.  However, future explorationand drilling results are uncertain and may involve substantial costs.  Despite this uncertainty or potential cost,discoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid amaterial decline in reserves and production. As a result, future oil and natural gas reserves may be dependent on oursuccess in exploiting existing properties and acquiring additionalreserves.  If our access to capitalbecomes limited or unavailable, our ability to make the necessary capitalinvestments to maintain or expand our 22Table of Contents oiland natural gas reserves will be impaired. Additionally, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful indeveloping additional reserves or acquiring additional reserves on terms thatmeet our investment objectives.  Withoutthese reserve additions, our reserves will deplete and as a consequence, eitherproduction from, or the average reserve life of, our properties will decline. Actual reserves will vary from reserve estimates. The value of our common stock depends upon, amongother things, the level of reserves of oil and natural gas.  Estimating reserves is inherently uncertain,and the figures herein are only estimates. Ultimately, actual reserves attributable to our properties will vary fromestimates, and those variations may be material.  The estimation of reserves involves a numberof factors and assumptions, including, among others:·     historicalproduction from our wells compared with production rates from similar producingwells in the area;·     futurecommodity prices, production and development costs, royalties and capitalexpenditures;·     initialproduction rates;·     productiondecline rates;·     ultimaterecovery of reserves;·     success offuture development activities;·     marketabilityof production;·     effects ofgovernment regulation; and·     othergovernment levies that may be imposed over the producing life of reserves. Reserve estimates are based on the relevant factors,assumptions and prices as of the date on which the evaluations areprepared.  Many of these factors aresubject to change and are beyond our control. If these factors, assumptions and prices prove to be inaccurate, actualresults may vary materially from reserve estimates. Delays in business operations could adversely affect our distributions. In addition to the usual delays in payment bypurchasers of oil and natural gas to the operators of our properties, and the delaysof those operators in remitting payment to us, payments between any of theseparties may also be delayed by:·     restrictions imposed by lenders;·     accounting delays;·     delays in the sale or delivery of products;·     delays in the connection of wells to a gathering system;·     blowouts or other accidents;·     adjustments for prior periods;·     recovery by the operator of expenses incurred in the operation of theproperties; and·     the establishment by the operator of reserves for these expenses. Any of these delays could expose us to additionalthird party credit risks. 23Table of Contents The industry in which we operate exposes us to potential liabilitiesthat may not be covered by insurance. Our operations are subject to all of the risksassociated with the operation and development of oil and natural gasproperties, including the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, and theproduction and transportation of oil and natural gas.  These risks include encountering unexpectedformations or pressures, premature declines of reservoirs, blow-outs, equipmentfailures and other accidents, cratering, sour gas releases, uncontrollableflows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, adverse weather conditions,pollution, other environmental risks, fires and spills.  A number of these risks could result inpersonal injury, loss of life, or environmental and other damage to ourproperty or the property of others. While we maintain reserves for anticipatedliabilities and carry various levels of insurance, we could be affected bycivil, criminal, regulatory or administrative actions, claims orproceedings.  We cannot fully protectagainst all of the risks listed above, nor are all of these risksinsurable.  There is no assurance thatany applicable insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protectus against liability for the risks listed above.  We could face substantial losses if an eventoccurs for which we are not fully insured or are not indemnified against or acustomer or insurer fails to meet its indemnification or insuranceobligations.  In addition, there can beno assurance that insurance will continue to be available to cover any or allof these risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costswill not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of suchinsurance prohibitive. We may incur material costs to comply with or as a result of health,safety, and environmental laws and regulations. The oil and natural gas industry is subject toextensive environmental regulation pursuant to local, provincial and federallegislation.  A violation of thatlegislation may result in the imposition of fines or the issuance of clean uporders.  Legislation regulating the oiland natural gas industry may be changed to impose higher standards andpotentially more costly obligations.  Forexample, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention onClimate Change, known as the Kyoto Protocol, was ratified by the Canadiangovernment in December 2002 and will require, among other things,significant reductions in greenhouse gases. The impact of the Kyoto Protocol on us is uncertain and may result insignificant additional costs for our future operations.  Although we have recorded a provision in ourfinancial statements relating to our estimated future environmental andreclamation obligations that we believe is reasonable, we cannot guarantee thatwe will be able to satisfy our actual future environmental and reclamationobligations. We are not fully insured against certainenvironmental risks, either because such insurance is not available or becauseof high premium costs.  In particular,insurance against risks from environmental pollution occurring over time, asopposed to sudden and catastrophic damages, is not available on economicallyreasonable terms.  Accordingly, any sitereclamation or abandonment costs actually incurred in the ordinary course ofbusiness in a specific period could negatively impact our cash flow.  Should we be unable to fully fund the cost ofremedying an environmental problem, we might be required to suspend operationsor enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the requiredremedy. 24Table of Contents We may have difficulty financing our planned capital expenditures,which could have an adverse affect on our business. We make and will continue to make substantialcapital expenditures in our exploration and development projects.  Without adequate capital resources, ourdrilling and other activities may be limited and our business, financialcondition and results of operations may suffer. We may not be able to secure necessary financing on reasonable terms orat all and financing may not continue to be available to us under our existingfinancing arrangements.  If capitalresources are unavailable, we may curtail our drilling, development and otheractivities or be forced to sell some of our assets under untimely orunfavorable terms.  Any such curtailmentor sale could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditionand results of operations. Unforeseen title defects may result in a loss of entitlement toproduction and reserves. Although we conduct title reviews in accordance withindustry practice prior to any purchase of resource assets or property, suchreviews do not guarantee that an unforeseen defect in the chain of title willnot arise and defeat our title to the purchased assets.  If such a defect were to occur, ourentitlement to the production from such purchased assets could be jeopardized.  Risks Related to Land Investment Segment The real estate investment industry is experiencing a severe andextended downturn that may continue for an indefinite period.  This downturn in economic conditions couldadversely affect our business. The real estate investment industry is cyclical innature and is particularly vulnerable to shifts in local, regional, andnational economic conditions outside of our control such as interest rates,housing demand, population growth, employment levels, job growth and propertytaxes.  Further, a weakening of theeconomic drivers in Hawaii, which include tourism, military spending,construction starts and employment, and a decrease in market demand adverselyimpacted the level of real estate activity in Hawaii.  The industry has experienced a significantdecrease in demand for new homes since 2007 and this trend may continue for anextended period of time.  Economicconditions in the United States have also weakened, which puts continued pressureon consumer confidence for residential real estate.  These challenging market conditions areexpected to continue for the foreseeable future and, in the near term, theseconditions may further deteriorate.  Weexpect that continued weakness in the industry could adversely affect our business,results of operations and financial condition. Considerable economic and political uncertaintiescurrently exist that could have adverse effects on consumer buying habits,construction costs, availability of labor and materials and other factors affectingus and the real estate industry in general. Significant expenditures associated with investment in real estate, suchas real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance costs and debt payments, cannotgenerally be reduced even though changes in Hawaiis or the nations economymay cause a decrease in revenues from our properties. 25Table of Contents Our real estate business is concentrated in the state of Hawaii.  As a result, our financial results aredependent on the economic growth and health of Hawaii, particularly the islandof Hawaii. Barnwells land investment segment is affected bythe condition of Hawaiis real estate market. The Hawaii real estate market is affected by Hawaiis economy and Hawaiistourism industry, as well as the United States economy in general.  Any future cash flows from Barnwells landdevelopment activities are subject to, among other factors, the level of realestate activity and prices, the demand for new housing and second homes on theisland of Hawaii, the rate of increase in the cost of building materials andlabor, the introduction of building code modifications, changes to zoning laws,and the level of confidence in Hawaiis economy.  The future economic growth in certainportions of the island of Hawaii may be adversely affected if itsinfrastructure, such as roads, airports, medical facilities and schools, arenot improved to meet increased demand. There can be no assurance that these improvements will occur. The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affectour business. The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii suchas, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes,volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse effect onour ability to develop and sell properties or realize income from ourprojects.  The occurrence of naturaldisasters could also cause increases in property and flood insurance rates anddeductibles, which could reduce demand for our properties. Increases in interest rates, tightening of lending standards anddecreases, limitations or restrictions in the availability of mortgagefinancing and other economic factors outside our control, such as consumerconfidence and declines in employment levels could lead to slowed home sales,which could adversely affect our revenues and earnings. The United States residential mortgage market isexperiencing significant disruption. Mortgage interest rates have recently experienced significant volatilityand contributed to the challenging market conditions faced by us and theindustry.  In addition, as a result ofincreased default rates and other factors, the willingness of many lenders tomake home mortgage loans has decreased and lenders have tightened their lendingstandards.  The volatility in interestrates, the decrease in the willingness of lenders to make home mortgage loans,and the tightening of lending standards have made it more difficult for somepotential buyers to finance the purchase of our homes.  Potential buyers may not be able to obtainacceptable financing to purchase residential lots within the Kaupulehu area, leadingto further declines in the market for homes. Any limitations or restrictions on the availability of mortgagefinancing or increases in mortgage interest rates could reduce residential lotsales, thereby reducing our revenues and earnings.  Even if potential buyers do not needfinancing, changes in interest rates and mortgage availability could make itharder for them to sell their existing homes to potential buyers who needfinancing.  Any limitations orrestrictions on the availability of mortgage financing, further interest rateincreases or limits on the deductibility of home mortgages could adverselyaffect our sales, which would reduce our revenues. 26Table of Contents Our business is subject to extensive regulation which makes itdifficult and expensive for us to conduct our operations. We are subject to a wide variety of federal, stateand local laws and regulations relating to land use and development and toenvironmental compliance and permitting obligations, including those related tothe use, storage, discharge, emission, and disposal of hazardousmaterials.  Any failure to comply withthese laws could result in capital or operating expenditures or the impositionof severe penalties or restrictions on operations that could adversely affectpresent and future operations, or jeopardize our ability to sell the leaseholdinterest currently held. Receipt of future percentage of sales payments is dependent upon thedevelopers continued efforts to develop and market the property. We are entitled to receive future payments based ona percentage of the sales prices of residential homes and lots withinapproximately 870 acres in the Kaupulehu area. However, in order to collect such percentage of sales payments we arereliant upon an unaffiliated third party developer to continue to develop andmarket the homes and lots.  The receiptof future percentage of sales payments could be jeopardized if the developerfails to proceed with development and marketing of the property. If required land use entitlements are not obtained at reasonable costs,or at all, our operating results could be adversely affected. We hold the leasehold interest to approximately1,000 acres of vacant land that is currently zoned conservation.  Our success in selling this interest may becontingent upon obtaining the necessary reclassification from the State ofHawaii Land Use Commission and county of Hawaii.  Obtaining the necessary reclassification andministerial approvals is often difficult, costly and may take several years, ormore, to complete.  Delays or failures toobtain the necessary reclassification approvals may adversely affect ourfinancial results. Environmental and other regulations may have an adverse effect on ourbusiness. Our properties are subject to federal, state andlocal environmental regulations and restrictions that may impose significantlimitations.  In most cases, approval todevelop requires multiple permits which involve a long, uncertain and costlyregulatory process. General economic conditions in the lodgingindustry could adversely affect ourfinancial results. We own a 1.5% passive minority interest in HualalaiResort, which includes the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Kaupulehu,two golf courses and a clubhouse, and a 1.5% passive minority interest in theKona Village Resort, an 80-acre oceanfront hotel property.  Soft economic conditions and reduced travelto North Kona, Hawaii could adversely affect these interests and, therefore,our financial results related to our investment.  The aforementioned properties are alsosubject to risks that generally relate to investments in commercial realestate, including governmental regulations; real estate, insurance, zoning, taxand eminent domain laws; the ongoing need for capital improvements to maintainor upgrade properties; fluctuations in real estate values; and the relativeilliquidity of real estate compared to other investments. The value of our lot acquisition rights could be impaired if thedeveloper of the property is unable to obtain required land use entitlements orsuccessfully negotiate development terms and agreements. We hold acquisition rights to 14 lots inagricultural-zoned leasehold lands in the upland area of Kaupulehu (MaukaLands) situated between the Queen Kaahumanu Highway and the Mamalahoa Highwayat Kaupulehu, North Kona, island and state of Hawaii.  The lot acquisition rights give us the  27Table of Contents rightto purchase residential lots which may be developed on the Mauka Lands.  The ability to purchase residential lots andthe value of such lots in the future is contingent upon the developer of theproperty obtaining the necessary land use reclassification, zoning anddevelopment approvals from regulatory entities. Obtaining the necessary reclassification and ministerial approvals isoften difficult, costly and may take several years, or more, to complete.  Delays or failures to obtain the necessaryreclassification and rezoning approvals may adversely affect our financialresults.  Our ability to purchase lotsand the value of such lots is also contingent upon the ability of the developerof the property to successfully negotiate development terms and agreementswithin the Mauka Lands.  If the developeris unsuccessful in such negotiations, our ability to purchase residential lotsin the Mauka Lands would be impaired.  Risks Related to Residential Real Estate Segment The homebuilding industry is experiencing a severe and extendeddownturn that may continue for an indefinite period and may continue toadversely affect our business, results of operations and stockholders equity. The residential homebuilding industry historicallyhas been cyclical and is sensitive to changes in economic conditions such asemployment levels, consumer confidence, consumer income, availability offinancing and interest rate levels. Adverse changes in any of these conditions generally, or in the marketin which we operate, could decrease demand and pricing for new homes or resultin customer cancellations of pending contracts, which could adversely affectthe number of home deliveries we make or reduce the prices we can charge forhomes, either of which could result in a reduction in our revenues ordeterioration of our margins. The homebuilding industry has experienced asignificant and sustained downturn characterized by decreased demand for newhomes, an oversupply of both new and resale home inventories, includingforeclosed homes; aggressive price competition among homebuilders, includingincreased incentives for home sales; and a more restrictive mortgage lendingenvironment.  Economic conditions in theUnited States have also weakened recently, which puts continued pressure onconsumer confidence for residential real estate.  These challenging market conditions areexpected to continue for the foreseeable future and, in the near term, theseconditions may further deteriorate.  Weexpect that continued weakness in the homebuilding industry could furtheradversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are reliant upon sales of residential homes and lots as a source ofliquidity.  If we are unable to sell thehomes or lots within a reasonable timeframe, our revenues, operating results,cash inflows and financial condition could be materially impacted. Barnwell currently owns two luxury residences heldfor sale and two parcels held for investment in the Lot 4A Increment I area ofKaupulehu, North Kona, Hawaii. The acquisition of the parcels and home constructioncosts on the two luxury homes were financed through a bank revolving creditfacility.  The entire unpaid principalbalance and any accrued interest is due in full on December 17, 2010,unless we sell a home and lot before then, in which case we will be required tomake a principal payment upon the sale of a home and lot in an amount equal to100% of the net sales proceeds of the home and lot. 28Table of Contents The timing and amount of residential home salesand/or lot sales are unpredictable and may be sporadic.  The inability to sell the homes or lotswithin a reasonable timeframe will lead to additional interest costs.  Additionally, if we are unable to sell thehomes or lots within a reasonable timeframe, we will need to refinance thedebt, obtain alternative terms or sources of financing, liquidate investmentsand/or operating assets, or reduce oil and natural gas capital expenditures tomake the required cash outflows.  Thiswould negatively impact our liquidity. Furthermore, if estimated cash inflows from home or lot sales do notoccur on a timely basis or are less than current expectations, our revenues,operating results, cash inflows and financial condition could be materiallyimpacted. If we are unable to sell the homes by December 17,2010, the due date of the facility, and we are unable to refinance, we will needto obtain alternative terms or sources of financing or liquidate investmentsand/or operating assets to repay the facility on its due date. We have limited experience in the homebuilding industry. Homebuilding is a new business segment for us and weare relying to a material extent on our business partners to help us executeour business plan. We may need additional financing to fund our real estate developmentactivities.  If we are unable to obtainsufficient financing or such financing is obtained on adverse terms, we may notbe able to operate our business as planned, which could adversely affect ourresults of operations and future growth. The real estate development industry is capitalintensive and homebuilding requires significant up-front expenditures toacquire land and begin development. Accordingly, we will incur substantial indebtedness to finance ourhomebuilding activities.  Although webelieve that internally generated funds and borrowing capacity under our creditfacility will be sufficient to fund our development and constructionactivities, the amounts available from such sources may not be adequate to meetour needs especially in the tight credit market.  Additionally, we will need to establish newfunding sources to finance any future land acquisition capitalexpenditures.  If such sources are notsufficient, we would seek additional capital in the form of debt or equityfinancing from a variety of potential sources, including additional bankfinancing, joint venture partner financing, and/or securities offerings.  The amount and types of indebtedness which wemay incur are limited by the terms of the agreements governing our existingdebt.  In addition, the availability ofborrowed funds to be utilized for land acquisition, development andconstruction may be greatly reduced, and the lending community may requireincreased amounts of equity to be invested in a project by borrowers inconnection with both new loans and the extension of existing loans.  The failure to obtain sufficient capital tofund our planned capital and other expenditures could have a material adverseeffect on our business. Our operating results from homebuilding are expected to be variable. Due to the cyclical nature of the real estatedevelopment industry, we expect to experience variability in our futureoperating results on a quarterly and an annual basis.  Factors expected to contribute to thisvariability include, among other things:·    thetiming of land acquisitions and permitting;·    thetiming of home closings, land sales and level of home sales;·    ourability to continue to acquire additional land or options thereon on acceptableterms; 29Table of Contents ·    thecondition of the real estate market and the general economy; and·    delaysin construction due to natural disasters, adverse weather, reduced contractoravailability and strikes. For example, the timing of land acquisitions andpermitting impacts our ability to pursue the development of new housingprojects in accordance with our business plan. If the timing of land acquisitions or zoning or regulatory approvals isdelayed, we will be delayed in our ability to develop housing projects, whichwould likely decrease our backlog. Furthermore, these delays could result in a decrease in our revenues andearnings for the periods in which the delays occur and possibly subsequentperiods until the planned housing projects can be completed.  A delay in a significant number of homeclosings or land sales due to natural disasters, adverse weather or contractoravailability would have a similar impact on revenues and earnings for theperiod in which the delays occur. Further, revenues may increase in subsequent periods over what wouldnormally be expected as a result of increased home closings as the delaysdescribed above are resolved. Changes in the government regulations applicable to homebuilders couldrestrict our business activities, increase our operating expenses and cause ourrevenues to decline. Regulatory requirements applicable to homebuilderscould cause us to incur significant liabilities and operating expenses andcould restrict our business activities. We are subject to local, state and federal statutes and rules regulating,among other things, certain developmental matters, building and site design,and matters concerning the protection of worker health and safety, and theenvironment.  Our operating expenses maybe increased by governmental regulations, such as building permit allocationordinances, impact and other fees and taxes, which may be imposed to defray thecost of providing certain governmental services and improvements.  Other governmental regulations, such asbuilding moratoriums and no growth or slow growth initiatives, which maybe adopted in communities which have developed rapidly, may cause delays in ourhome projects or otherwise restrict our business activities resulting inreductions in our revenues.  Any delay orrefusal to grant us necessary licenses, permits or approvals from governmentagencies could cause substantial increases to development costs or cause us toabandon the project and to sell the affected land at a potential loss, which inturn could harm our operating results. Ourresidential real estate segment is dependent on the continued availability andsatisfactory performance of our building contractors, which,if unavailable, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We conduct our construction operations throughunaffiliated building contractors.  As aconsequence, we depend on the continued availability of and satisfactoryperformance by the contractors for the construction of our homes.  There may not be sufficient availability ofand satisfactory performance by the contractors.  If the contractors quality of work is notsufficient, our ability to construct homes on the schedule we have plannedwould be affected.  This could result inan increase in our costs to construct homes in a timely manner, which couldresult in an increase in our overall costs and thus a decline in our marginsand in our net income.  Further,non-timely completion of work could affect our ability to sell homes based uponour projected timeline thus possibly affecting our ability to obtain additionalfinancing to continue our homebuilding efforts. 30Table of Contents Shortages of labor or materials and/or increases in the price ofmaterials could delay construction or increase the cost of home constructionthereby reducing our sales and earnings. The homebuilding business has from time to timeexperienced building material and labor shortages, as well as volatility in theprices of certain materials, including lumber, framing, drywall and cement,which are significant components of home construction costs.  These labor and material shortages can bemore severe during periods of strong demand for housing or during periods wherethe area in which we operate experiences natural disasters that have asignificant impact on existing residential and commercial structures.  Shortages and price increases could causedelays in and increase our costs of home construction, which in turn could harmour operating results. The market value of ourreal estate interests could drop significantly, which may require write-downsof the carrying value of our real estate held for development and investment toits estimated fair value.  Anywrite-downs would negatively impact our results of operations. The risk of owning developed and undeveloped landcan be substantial for homebuilders. Homebuilding requires that we acquire landfor replacement and expansion of land inventory within our existing and newmarkets.  The risks inherent inpurchasing and developing land increase as consumer demand for housingdecreases.  Thus, we may have bought anddeveloped land which we cannot profitably sell or on which we cannot profitablybuild and sell homes.  The market valueof land, buildable lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly asa result of changing economic market conditions.  It is possible that the measures we employ tomanage inventory risks will not be successful and as a result our operationsmay suffer.  In addition, inventory carryingcosts can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performingmarket.  Prevailing market conditions maysignificantly influence the market value of our real estate held for saleand/or our residential parcels held for investment.  In the event of significant changes ineconomic or market conditions, we may have to sell homes or land inventory atsignificantly lower margins or at a loss. Furthermore, if the market conditions continue to deteriorate, we may berequired to record write-downs of the carrying value of our real estate heldfor sale and residential parcels held for investment.  Such write-downs would have a negative impacton our results of operations and financial condition. Severe weather and other natural conditions or disasters may disrupt ordelay construction and may impair the value of our real estate property. Severe weather and other natural conditions ordisasters, such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes,tornadoes, volcanic activity, droughts, floods, and heavy or prolonged rain,can negatively affect our operations by requiring us to delay or haltconstruction or to perform potentially costly repairs to our projects underconstruction and to unsold homes. Further, these conditions can delay home closings, adversely affect thecost or availability of materials or labor, or impair the value of the propertyon a temporary or permanent basis.  Tothe extent our insurance is not adequate to cover business interruption lossesor repair costs resulting from these events, our total earned revenues andearnings may be adversely affected. 31Table of Contents The homebuilding industry is highly competitive and, with more limitedresources than some of our competitors, we may not be able to competeeffectively. The homebuilding industry is highlycompetitive.  We face competition fromother developers on the island of Hawaii, and from other luxury residentialproperties in Hawaii and the mainland United States.  In many cases, our competitors have greaterfinancial and other resources, more established market positions, lower costsof capital, labor and material than we do. Homebuilders compete for, among other things, desirable land, financing,raw materials, skilled labor and purchasers. We compete for residential sales on the basis of a number ofinterrelated factors, including location, reputation, amenities, design,quality and price, with numerous homebuilders, including some homebuilders withgreater financial resources and/or lower costs than us.  Increased competition could also reduce thenumber of homes we deliver, reducing our revenues, or cause us to acceptreduced margins to maintain sales volumes. A reduction in our revenue or margins due to competitive factors couldaffect our ability to service our debt, including the credit facilities.  Risks Related to Contract Drilling Segment Demand for water well drilling and/or pump installation isvolatile.  A decrease in demand for ourservices could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. Demand for services is highly dependent upon landdevelopment activities in the state of Hawaii. As also noted above, the real estate development industry is cyclical innature and is particularly vulnerable to shifts in local, regional, andnational economic conditions outside of our control such as interest rates,housing demand, population growth, employment levels and job growth andproperty taxes.  If we experience adecrease in water well drilling and/or pump installation contracts, we mayexperience decreased revenues and operating results. A significant portion of our contract drilling business is dependent onmunicipalities and a decline in municipal spending could adversely impact ourbusiness. A significant portion of our contract drillingdivision revenues are derived from water and infrastructure contracts withgovernmental entities or agencies. Reduced tax revenues in certain regions may limit spending and newdevelopment by local municipalities which in turn will affect the demand forour services in these regions.  Materialreductions in spending by a significant number of municipalities or localgovernmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business,results of operations, liquidity and financial position. Our contract drilling operations face significant competition fromcompanies with greater financial resources. We face competition for our services from a varietyof competitors.  Many of our competitorsutilize drilling rigs that drill as quickly as our equipment but require lesslabor.  Our strategy is to compete basedon pricing and to a lesser degree, quality of service.  If we are unable to compete effectively withour competitors, our financial results could be adversely affected. The loss of or damage to key vendor, customer or sub-contractorrelationships would adversely affect our operations. Our business is dependent on our relationships withkey vendors, customers and subcontractors. The loss of or damage to any of our key relationships could negativelyaffect our business. 32Table of Contents Entity-Wide Risks The economic downturn may have impacts on our business and financialcondition that we currently cannot predict. The ongoing economic downturn may have furtherimpacts on our business and our financial condition, and we may face additionalchallenges if economic conditions do not improve.  Our ability to access the capital markets maybe restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to raise capital, whichcould have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic andbusiness conditions.  The economic situationcould adversely affect the demand for real estate development activities in thestate of Hawaii which in turn could cause a decline in the water well drillingand/or pump installation services required. Furthermore, weak market conditions could cause a deeper decrease indemand for luxury homes.  Additionally,economic conditions could lead to a further reduction in demand for oil andnatural gas, or lower prices for natural gas and oil, or both, which could havea negative impact on our revenues. We are reliant upon future cash flows from operations, land investmentsegment development rights and percentage of sales proceeds, and availablecredit as a source of liquidity.  Ifestimated cash inflows do not occur timely or are less than current expectations,our liquidity may be negatively impacted. In addition to cash flows from oil and natural gasand contract drilling operations, we rely upon land investment segmentdevelopment rights and percentage of sales payment proceeds as a source of liquidity.  However, oil and natural gas prices have beenhistorically volatile and the timing and amount of land investment segmentpercentage of sales proceeds are unpredictable, may be sporadic, and are notunder our control.  Development rightsproceeds, on the other hand, are scheduled but there is no assurance thatfuture monies will be received. We also have a credit facility with a Canadian bankthat is denominated in Canadian dollars. Any decreases in currency exchange rates affect the amount of creditavailable to us.  Furthermore, our realestate revolving credit facilitys loan advance limitation is subject to theunderlying securitys appraised value. Any decreases in the appraised value of the underlying security couldresult in the need to pay down a portion of the outstanding borrowings. Accordingly, if estimated cash inflows do not occuron a timely basis or are less than current expectations or if we are subject toreductions in available credit, our revenues, operating results, cash inflowsand financial condition could be materially impacted. Our future level of indebtedness and the terms of our financingarrangements may adversely affect our operations, financial condition and limitour growth. At September 30, 2009, we had borrowings underour credit facilities of approximately $31 million.  In the ordinary course of business, we mayincur significant additional debt, to the extent permitted by our revolvingcredit facilities, in order to fund future capital expenditures, acquisitionsand homebuilding activities. 33Table of Contents The terms of our revolving credit facilities imposerestrictions on our ability and, in some cases, the ability of our subsidiariesto take a number of actions that we may otherwise desire to take, including oneor more of the following:·    incurringadditional debt, including guarantees of indebtedness;·    makinginvestments;·    creatingliens on our assets; and·    sellingassets. Our level of indebtedness and the covenantscontained in our financing agreements could have important consequences.  For example, it could:·    limitour ability to obtain future financing, through equity offerings or debtfinancings, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions,refinancing of indebtedness or general corporate and other activities;·    requireus to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations toservice our debt, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow for otherpurposes (i.e., working capital, capital expenditures, and other generalbusiness activities);·    limitour flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, the changes in our business;·    subjectus to higher costs and more restrictive covenants in the future for workingcapital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or otherpurposes, if additional financing is obtained;·    makeus vulnerable to increases in interest rates as our revolving credit facilitiesare subject to variable interest rates;·    detractfrom our ability to successfully withstand a downturn in our business or theeconomy generally;·    placeus at a competitive disadvantage because we have more debt than some of ourcompetitors; and·    makeus more vulnerable to general economic downturns and adverse developments inour industries, especially declines in oil and natural gas prices, and theeconomy in general. We may incur additional debt, including significantsecured indebtedness, or issue additional stock in order to fund capitalexpenditures, make future acquisitions, and develop our properties.  A higher level of indebtedness increases therisk that we may default on our obligations. Our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level ofindebtedness depends on our future performance. General economic conditions, oil and natural gas prices and financial,business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance.  Many of these factors are beyond ourcontrol.  Factors that will affect ourability to raise cash through a refinancing of our debt include financialmarket conditions, the value of our assets and our performance at the time weneed capital. In addition, our bank borrowing base on our Canadianrevolving credit facility is subject to periodic redetermination.  A lowering of our borrowing base couldrequire us to repay indebtedness in excess of the borrowing base, or we mayneed to further secure the lenders with additional collateral. Borrowings under the real estate revolving creditfacility are subject to a loan advance limitation based on the appraised valueof the underlying security.  The loanadvance limitation may be reduced as a result of a decrease in appraised valueof the underlying security.  Ifborrowings under the facility exceed the loan advance limitation, Barnwell willbe required to make debt repayments in the  34Table of Contents amountof the excess.  Furthermore, the entireunpaid principal balance and all accrued interest is due in full on December 17,2010, unless we sell a home and lot before then, in which case we will berequired to make a principal payment upon the sale of a home and lot in anamount equal to 100% of the net sales proceeds of the home and lot.  If we are unable to sell the homes or lotswithin a reasonable timeframe, we will need to refinance the debt, obtainalternative terms or sources of financing, liquidate investments and/oroperating assets, or reduce oil and natural gas capital expenditures to makethe required cash outflows. The price of our common stock has been volatile and could continue tofluctuate substantially. The market price of our common stock has beenvolatile and could fluctuate based on a variety of factors, including:·    fluctuationsin commodity prices;·    variationsin results of operations;·    announcementsby us and our competitors;·    legislativeor regulatory changes;·    generaltrends in the industry;·    generalmarket conditions; and·    analystsestimates and other events in the oil and natural gas industry. Failure to retain key personnel could hurt our operations. We require highly skilled and experienced personnelto operate our business.  In addition tocompeting in highly competitive industries, we compete in a highly competitivelabor market.  Our business could beadversely affected by an inability to retain personnel or upward pressure onwages as a result of the highly competitive labor market. A small number of stockholders, including our executive officers, own asignificant amount of our common stock and have influence over our businessregardless of the opposition of other stockholders. As of September 30, 2009, two of our investorsand our executive officers held approximately 45% of our common stock.  The interests of these stockholders may notalways coincide with the interests of other stockholders.  These stockholders, acting together, havesignificant influence over all matters submitted to our stockholders, includingthe election of our directors, and could accelerate, delay, deter or prevent achange of control of us.  Thesestockholders are able to exercise significant control over our business,policies and affairs. We believe that the currently enacted requirement to comply with Section 404(b) ofthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act in fiscal 2010 will result in additional expenses andmay divert managements attention. Under currently enacted rules, the Company will berequired to comply with the Section 404(b) auditor attestation of theSarbanes-Oxley Act for fiscal 2010 and our independent registered publicaccounting firm would be required to provide its attestation of the adequacy ofthe Companys internal controls.  If suchcompliance is required, the Company anticipates incurring additional generaland administrative expenses and anticipates that its compliance efforts maydivert managements time and attention away from other aspects of our business. 35Table of Contents Adverse changes in actuarial assumptions used to calculate retirementplan costs due to economic or other factors, or lower returns on plan assetscould adversely affect

10,BRN,BARNWELL INDUSTRIES,2008-12-18,"ITEM 1A.               RISK FACTORS The business of Barnwell and its subsidiaries facenumerous risks, including those set forth below or those described elsewhere inthis Form 10-K or in Barnwells other filings with the SEC.  The risks described below are not the onlyrisks that Barnwell faces, nor are they necessarily listed in order ofsignificance.  If any of the followingrisk factors should occur, our profitability, financial condition or liquiditycould be materially impacted. 20 RisksRelated to Oil and Natural Gas Segment The oiland natural gas industry is highly competitive. We compete for capital, acquisitions of reserves,undeveloped lands, skilled personnel, access to drilling rigs, service rigs andother equipment, access to processing facilities, pipeline and refiningcapacity and in many other respects with a substantial number of otherorganizations, many of which may have greater technical and financial resourcesthan we do.  Some of these organizationsexplore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas, carry on refiningoperations and market oil and other products on a worldwide basis.  As a result of these complementaryactivities, some of our competitors may have competitive resources that aregreater and more diverse than ours. Furthermore, many of our competitors may have a competitive advantagewhen responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gasproduction, such as changing prices and production levels, the cost andavailability of alternative fuels and the application of governmentregulations.  If our competitors are ableto capitalize on these competitive resources, it could adversely affect ourrevenues. Oil andnatural gas prices are volatile.  Ourresults of operations and financial condition are highly dependent on theprices of and demand for our oil and natural gas production. Oil and natural gas prices are volatile and havefluctuated widely during recent years in response to many factors that arebeyond our control.  These factors include,but are not limited to, minor changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty,weather, worldwide political instability, foreign supply of oil and naturalgas, the level of consumer product demand, government regulations and taxes,the price and availability of alternative fuels and the overall economicenvironment.  Any decline in crude oil ornatural gas prices may have a material adverse effect on our operations,financial condition, operating cash flows, borrowing ability, reserves, amountof capital that we are able to allocate for the development of oil and naturalgas reserves and future growth. Energy prices are also subject to other political andregulatory actions outside our control, which may include changes in thepolicies of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries or otherdevelopments involving or affecting oil-producing countries, or actions orreactions of the government of the United States in anticipation of or inresponse to such developments. If oiland natural gas prices decrease, we may be required to take write-downs of thecarrying value of our oil and natural gas properties. We follow the full costmethod of accounting for costs related to our oil and natural gasproperties.  Under this method, the netbook value of properties less related deferred income taxes, may not exceed acalculated ceiling.  The ceiling is theestimated after tax future net revenues from proved oil and natural gasproperties, discounted at 10% per year. In calculating discounted future net revenues, oil and natural gasprices in effect at the time of the calculation are held constant, except forchanges which are fixed and determinable by existing contracts.  The full cost ceiling is evaluated at the endof each quarter using the prices for oil and natural gas at that date.  The excess, if any, of the net book valueabove the ceiling is required to be written off as an expense.  A significant decline in oil and natural gasprices from current levels, or other factors, without other mitigatingcircumstances, could result in reductions in the carrying value of such assetsand an equivalent charge to earnings. 21 Anincrease in operating costs or a decline in our production level could have amaterial adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Higher operating costs for our underlying propertieswill directly decrease the amount of cash flow received by us and, therefore,may reduce the price of our common stock. Electricity, supplies, and labor costs are a few of the operating coststhat are susceptible to material fluctuation. The level of production from our existing propertiesmay decline at rates greater than anticipated due to unforeseen circumstances,many of which are beyond our control.  Asignificant decline in our production could result in materially lower revenuesand cash flow. Our operating results are affectedby our ability to market the oil and natural gas that we produce. Our business depends in part upon the availability,proximity and capacity of natural gas gathering systems, pipelines andprocessing facilities.  Canadian federaland provincial, as well as United States federal and state, regulation of oiland natural gas production, processing and transportation, tax and energypolicies, general economic conditions, and changes in supply and demand couldadversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas.  If market factors change and inhibit themarketing of our production, overall production or realized prices may decline. We are not the operator and havelimited influence over the operations of the majority of our oil and naturalgas properties. We hold minority interests in the majority of our oiland natural gas properties.  As a result,we cannot control the pace of exploration or development or major decisionsaffecting the drilling of wells or the plan for development and production atnon-operated properties, although contract provisions give Barnwell certain consentrights in some matters.  The operatorsinfluence over these matters can affect the pace at which we incur capitalexpenditures.  Additionally, as certainunderlying joint venture data is not accessible to us, we depend on theoperators at non-operated properties to provide us with reliable accountinginformation. Our operations are subject to domestic and foreign governmentregulation and other risks, particularly in the United States and Canada. Barnwells oil and natural gas operations are affectedby political developments and laws and regulations, particularly in the UnitedStates and Canada, such as restrictions on production, restrictions on importsand exports, the maintenance of specified reserves, tax increases andretroactive tax claims, expropriation of property, cancellation of contractrights, environmental protection controls, environmental compliancerequirements and laws pertaining to workers health and safety.  Further, the right to explore for and developoil and natural gas on lands in Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia iscontrolled by the governments of each of those provinces.  Changes in royalties and other terms ofprovincial leases, permits and reservations may have a substantial effect onBarnwells operations.  We derive asignificant portion of our revenues from our operations in Canada.  In fiscal 2008, we derived approximately 75%of our operating revenues from operations in Canada. Additionally, our ability to compete in the Canadianoil and natural gas industry may be adversely affected by governmentalregulations or other policies that favor the awarding of contracts to  22 contractorsin which Canadian nationals have substantial ownership interests.  Furthermore, we may face governmentallyimposed restrictions or fees from time to time on the transfer of funds to theU.S. Government regulations control and often limit accessto potential markets and impose extensive requirements concerning employeesafety, environmental protection, pollution control and remediation ofenvironmental contamination. Environmental regulations, in particular, prohibit access to somemarkets and make others less economical, increase equipment and personnel costsand often impose liability without regard to negligence or fault.  In addition, governmental regulations maydiscourage our customers activities, reducing demand for our products andservices. Compliance with foreign tax and other lawsmay adversely affect our operations. Tax and other laws and regulations are not alwaysinterpreted consistently among local, regional and national authorities.  Income tax laws, other legislation orgovernment incentive programs relating to the oil and natural gas industry mayin the future be changed or interpreted in a manner that adversely affects usand our stockholders.  It is alsopossible that in the future we will be subject to disputes concerning taxationand other matters in Canada, including the manner in which we calculate ourincome for tax purposes, and these disputes could have a material adverseeffect on our financial performance. We are dependent upon future discoveries oracquisitions of oil and natural gas to maintain our reserves. We actively explore for oil and natural gasreserves.  However, future explorationand drilling results are uncertain and may involve substantial costs.  Despite this uncertainty or potential cost,discoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid amaterial decline in reserves and production. As a result, future oil and natural gas reserves may be dependent on oursuccess in exploiting existing properties and acquiring additionalreserves.  If our access to capitalbecomes limited or unavailable, our ability to make the necessary capitalinvestments to maintain or expand our oil and natural gas reserves will beimpaired.  Additionally, we cannotguarantee that we will be successful in developing additional reserves oracquiring additional reserves on terms that meet our investmentobjectives.  Without these reserveadditions, our reserves will deplete and as a consequence, either productionfrom, or the average reserve life of, our properties will decline. Actual reserves will vary from reserveestimates. The value of our common stock depends upon, amongother things, the level of reserves of oil and natural gas.  Estimating reserves is inherently uncertain,and the figures herein are only estimates. Ultimately, actual reserves attributable to our properties will varyfrom estimates, and those variations may be material.  The estimation of reserves involves a numberof factors and assumptions, including, among others:·                  historicalproduction from our wells compared with production rates from similar producingwells in the area;·                  futurecommodity prices, production and development costs, royalties and capitalexpenditures;·                  initialproduction rates;·                  productiondecline rates;·                  ultimaterecovery of reserves; 23 ·                  success of futuredevelopment activities;·                  marketabilityof production;·                  effects ofgovernment regulation; and·                  othergovernment levies that may be imposed over the producing life of reserves. Reserve estimates are based on the relevant factors,assumptions and prices as of the date on which the evaluations areprepared.  Many of these factors aresubject to change and are beyond our control. If these factors, assumptions and prices prove to be inaccurate, actualresults may vary materially from reserve estimates. Delays in business operations could adverselyaffect our distributions. In addition to the usual delays in payment bypurchasers of oil and natural gas to the operators of our properties, and thedelays of those operators in remitting payment to us, payments between any ofthese parties may also be delayed by:·                  restrictionsimposed by lenders;·                  accountingdelays;·                  delays in thesale or delivery of products;·                  delays in theconnection of wells to a gathering system;·                  blowouts orother accidents;·                  adjustments forprior periods;·                  recovery by theoperator of expenses incurred in the operation of the properties; and·                  theestablishment by the operator of reserves for these expenses. Any of these delays could expose us to additionalthird party credit risks. The industry in which we operate exposes usto potential liabilities that may not be covered by insurance. Our operations are subject to all of the risksassociated with the operation and development of oil and natural gasproperties, including the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, and theproduction and transportation of oil and natural gas.  These risks include encountering unexpectedformations or pressures, premature declines of reservoirs, blow-outs, equipmentfailures and other accidents, cratering, sour gas releases, uncontrollableflows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, adverse weather conditions,pollution, other environmental risks, fires and spills.  A number of these risks could result in personalinjury, loss of life, or environmental and other damage to our property or theproperty of others. While we maintain reserves for anticipated liabilitiesand carry various levels of insurance, we could be affected by civil, criminal,regulatory or administrative actions, claims or proceedings.  We cannot fully protect against all of therisks listed above, nor are all of these risks insurable.  There is no assurance that any applicableinsurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us againstliability for the risks listed above.  Wecould face substantial losses if an event occurs for which we are not fullyinsured or are not indemnified against or a customer or insurer fails to meetits indemnification or insurance obligations. In addition, there can be no assurance that insurance will continue tobe available to cover any or all of these risks, or, even if available, thatinsurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, soas to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive. 24 We may incur material costs to comply with oras a result of health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations. The oil and natural gas industry is subject toextensive environmental regulation pursuant to local, provincial and federallegislation.  A violation of thatlegislation may result in the imposition of fines or the issuance of clean uporders.  Legislation regulating the oiland natural gas industry may be changed to impose higher standards andpotentially more costly obligations.  Forexample, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention onClimate Change, known as the Kyoto Protocol, was ratified by the Canadiangovernment in December 2002 and will require, among other things, significantreductions in greenhouse gases.  Theimpact of the Kyoto Protocol on us is uncertain and may result in significantadditional costs for our future operations. Although we record a provision in our financial statements relating toour estimated future environmental and reclamation obligations, we cannotguarantee that we will be able to satisfy our actual future environmental andreclamation obligations. We are not fully insured against certain environmentalrisks, either because such insurance is not available or because of highpremium costs.  In particular, insuranceagainst risks from environmental pollution occurring over time, as opposed tosudden and catastrophic damages, is not available on economically reasonableterms.  Accordingly, any site reclamationor abandonment costs actually incurred in the ordinary course of business in aspecific period could negatively impact our cash flow.  Should we be unable to fully fund the cost ofremedying an environmental problem, we might be required to suspend operationsor enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the requiredremedy. We may have difficulty financing our planned capital expenditures,which could have an adverse affect on our business. We make and will continue to make substantial capitalexpenditures in our exploration and development projects.  Without adequate capital resources, ourdrilling and other activities may be limited and our business, financialcondition and results of operations may suffer. We may not be able to secure necessary financing on reasonable terms orat all and financing may not continue to be available to us under our existingfinancing arrangements.  If capitalresources are unavailable, we may curtail our drilling, development and otheractivities or be forced to sell some of our assets under untimely orunfavorable terms.  Any such curtailmentor sale could have a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition and results of operations. Unforeseen title defects may result in a loss of entitlement toproduction and reserves. Although we conduct title reviews in accordance withindustry practice prior to any purchase of resource assets or property, suchreviews do not guarantee that an unforeseen defect in the chain of title will notarise and defeat our title to the purchased assets.  If such a defect were to occur, ourentitlement to the production from such purchased assets could be jeopardized. 25 Risks Related to Land InvestmentSegment The real estate investment industry is experiencing a severe andextended downturn that may continue for an indefinite period.  This downturn in economic conditions couldadversely affect our business. The real estate investment industry is cyclical innature and is particularly vulnerable to shifts in local, regional, andnational economic conditions outside of our control such as interest rates,housing demand, population growth, employment levels and job growth andproperty taxes.  Further, a weakening ofthe economic drivers in Hawaii, which include tourism, military spending,construction starts and employment, and a decrease in market demand adverselyimpacted the level of real estate activity in Hawaii.  The industry has experienceda significant decrease in demand for new homes in recent months and this trendmay continue for an extended period of time. Economic conditions in the United States have also weakened recently,which puts continued pressure on consumer confidence for residential realestate.  These challenging marketconditions are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and, in the nearterm, these conditions may further deteriorate. We expect that continued weakness in the industry could adversely affectour business, results of operations and financial condition. Considerable economic and political uncertaintiescurrently exist that could have adverse effects on consumer buying habits,construction costs, availability of labor and materials and other factorsaffecting us and the real estate industry in general.  Significant expenditures associated withinvestment in real estate, such as real estate taxes, insurance, maintenancecosts and debt payments, cannot generally be reduced even though changes inHawaiis or the nations economy may cause a decrease in revenues from ourproperties. Our real estate business is primarily concentrated in the state ofHawaii.  As a result, our financialresults are dependent on the economic growth and health of Hawaii, particularlythe island of Hawaii. Barnwells land investment segment is affected by thecondition of Hawaiis real estate market. The Hawaii real estate market is affected by Hawaiis economy and Hawaiistourism industry, as well as the United States economy in general.  Any future cash flows from Barnwells landdevelopment activities are subject to, among other factors, the level of realestate activity and prices, the demand for new housing and second homes on theisland of Hawaii, the rate of increase in the cost of building materials andlabor, the introduction of building code modifications, changes to zoning laws,and the level of confidence in Hawaiis economy.  The future economic growth in certainportions of the island of Hawaii may be adversely affected if itsinfrastructure, such as roads, airports, medical facilities and schools, arenot improved to meet increased demand. There can be no assurance that these improvements will occur. The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect ourbusiness. The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii such as,but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, volcanicactivity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse effect on ourability to develop and sell properties or realize income from ourprojects.  The occurrence of naturaldisasters could also cause increases in property and flood insurance rates anddeductibles, which could reduce demand for our properties. 26 Increases in interest rates, tightening of lending standards anddecreases, limitations or restrictions in the availability of mortgagefinancing and other economic factors outside our control, such as consumerconfidence and declines in employment levels could lead to slowed home sales,which could adversely affect our total earned revenues and earnings. The United States residential mortgage market isexperiencing significant disruption. Mortgage interest rates have recently experienced significant volatilityand contributed to the challenging market conditions faced by us and theindustry.  In addition, as a result ofincreased default rates and other factors, the willingness of many lenders tomake home mortgage loans has decreased and lenders have tightened their lendingstandards.  The volatility in interestrates, the decrease in the willingness of lenders to make home mortgage loans,and the tightening of lending standards have made it more difficult for somepotential buyers to finance the purchase of our homes.  Potential buyers may not be able to obtainacceptable financing to purchase residential lots within the Kaupulehu area,leading to further declines in the market for homes.  Any limitations or restrictions on theavailability of mortgage financing or increases in mortgage interest ratescould reduce residential lot sales, thereby reducing our total revenues and netearnings.  Even if potential buyers donot need financing, changes in interest rates and mortgage availability couldmake it harder for them to sell their existing homes to potential buyers whoneed financing.  Any limitations orrestrictions on the availability of mortgage financing, further interest rateincreases or limits on the deductibility of home mortgages could adverselyaffect our sales, which would reduce our revenues. Our business is subject to extensive regulation which makes itdifficult and expensive for us to conduct our operations. We are subject to a wide variety of federal, state andlocal laws and regulations relating to land use and development and toenvironmental compliance and permitting obligations, including those related tothe use, storage, discharge, emission, and disposal of hazardousmaterials.  Any failure to comply withthese laws could result in capital or operating expenditures or the impositionof severe penalties or restrictions on operations that could adversely affectpresent and future operations, or jeopardize our ability to sell the leaseholdinterest currently held. Future percentage of sales payments could be impaired if the developerof the property is unable to negotiate fee simple interests. In 2006 we sold our leasehold interest in the secondof two increments of resort/residential zoned property to an unrelateddeveloper.  As a part of the sale, we areentitled to receive future payments based on a percentage of the sales pricesof residential lots sold in this second increment.  Receipt of these percentage of sales paymentswill be contingent upon the ability of the developer of the leaseholdinterest in the resort/residential zoned property to successfully negotiate feesimple prices within this second increment. If the developer is unsuccessful in such negotiations, our ability toreceive percentage of sales payments on the sales of those lots would beimpaired and could impair our ability to receive percentage of sales paymentson the sales of lots in the first increment. Future percentage of sales payments would be impacted if the developerof the second of two increments does not complete the necessary infrastructureand amenities. Demand for lots is dependent upon the developercompleting the necessary infrastructure and amenities and thus we are reliantupon the developer to construct such improvements within the area.   27 If thedeveloper does not do so, our ability to receive future percentage of salespayments from the sales of lots in the second of two increments would benegatively impacted. If we are unable to obtain required land use entitlements at reasonablecosts, or at all, our operating results could be adversely affected. We hold the leasehold interest to approximately 1,000acres of vacant land that is currently zoned conservation.  Our success in selling this interest may becontingent upon obtaining the necessary reclassification from the State ofHawaii Land Use Commission and county of Hawaii.  Obtaining the necessary reclassification andministerial approvals is often difficult, costly and may take several years, ormore, to complete.  Delays or failures toobtain the necessary reclassification approvals may adversely affect ourfinancial results. Environmental and other regulations may have an adverse effect on ourbusiness. Our properties are subject to federal, state and localenvironmental regulations and restrictions that may impose significantlimitations.  In most cases, approval todevelop requires multiple permits which involve a long, uncertain and costly regulatoryprocess. General economic conditions in the lodgingindustry couldadversely affect our overall financial results. We own a 1.5% passive minority interest in HualalaiResort, which includes the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Kaupulehu,two golf courses and a clubhouse, and the Kona Village Resort, an 80-acreoceanfront hotel property.  Soft economicconditions and reduced travel to North Kona, Hawaii could adversely affect ourresults from these properties and, therefore, our overall financialresults.  The aforementioned propertiesare also subject to risks that generally relate to investments in commercialreal estate, including governmental regulations; real estate, insurance,zoning, tax and eminent domain laws; the ongoing need for capital improvementsto maintain or upgrade properties; fluctuations in real estate values; and therelative illiquidity of real estate compared to other investments. The value of our lot acquisition rights could be impaired if thedeveloper of the property is unable to obtain required land use entitlements orsuccessfully negotiate development terms and agreements. We hold acquisition rights to 14 lots inagricultural-zoned leasehold lands in the upland area of Kaupulehu (MaukaLands) situated between the Queen Kaahumanu Highway and the Mamalahoa Highwayat Kaupulehu, North Kona, island and state of Hawaii.  The lot acquisition rights give us the rightto purchase residential lots which may be developed on the Mauka Lands.  The ability to purchase residential lots andthe value of such lots in the future is contingent upon the developer of theproperty obtaining the necessary land use reclassification, zoning anddevelopment approvals from regulatory entities. Obtaining the necessary reclassification and ministerial approvals isoften difficult, costly and may take several years, or more, to complete.  Delays or failures to obtain the necessaryreclassification and rezoning approvals may adversely affect our financialresults.  Our ability to purchase lotsand the value of such lots is also contingent upon the ability of the developerof the property to successfully negotiate development terms and agreementswithin the Mauka Lands.  If the developeris unsuccessful in such negotiations, our ability to purchase residential lotsin the Mauka Lands would be impaired. 28 Risks Related to Residential RealEstate Segment The homebuilding industry is experiencing a severe and extendeddownturn that may continue for an indefinite period and may continue toadversely affect our business, results of operations and stockholders equity. The residential homebuilding industry historically hasbeen cyclical and is sensitive to changes in economic conditions such asemployment levels, consumer confidence, consumer income, availability offinancing and interest rate levels. Adverse changes in any of these conditions generally, or in the marketin which we operate, could decrease demand and pricing for new homes or resultin customer cancellations of pending contracts, which could adversely affectthe number of home deliveries we make or reduce the prices we can charge forhomes, either of which could result in a reduction in our revenues ordeterioration of our margins. The homebuilding industry has experienced asignificant and sustained downturn characterized by decreased demand for newhomes, an oversupply of both new and resale home inventories, includingforeclosed homes; aggressive price competition among homebuilders, includingincreased incentives for home sales; and a more restrictive mortgage lendingenvironment.  Economic conditions in theUnited States have also weakened recently, which puts continued pressure onconsumer confidence for residential real estate.  These challenging market conditions areexpected to continue for the foreseeable future and, in the near term, theseconditions may further deteriorate.  Weexpect that continued weakness in the homebuilding industry could furtheradversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are reliant upon sales of residential homes under development andlots held for investment as a source of liquidity.  If we are unable to sell the homes or lotswithin a reasonable timeframe, our revenues, operating results, cash inflows and financial condition couldbe materially impacted. Barnwell currently owns four parcels in the Lot 4AIncrement I area of Kaupulehu, North Kona, Hawaii.  We are in the process of developingresidences for future sale on two of the parcels and intend to hold theremaining two parcels for investment purposes. The two turnkey homes currently being built are slated for completionwithin the next six months. The acquisition of the parcels and home constructioncosts on the two turnkey homes are being financed through a bank revolvingcredit facility.  The entire unpaidprincipal balance and all accrued interest is due in full on December 17,2010, unless we sell a home and lot before then, in which case we will berequired to make a principal payment upon the sale of a home and lot in anamount equal to 100% of the net sales proceeds of the home and lot. The timing and amount of residential home sales and/orlot sales are unpredictable and may be sporadic.  The inability to sell the homes or lotswithin a reasonable timeframe may lead to unnecessary interest costs.  Additionally, if we are unable to sell thehomes or lots within a reasonable timeframe, we may need to request a loanextension, obtain refinancing or reduce oil and natural gas capital expendituresto make the required cash outflows.  Thiswould negatively impact our liquidity. Furthermore, if estimated cash inflows from home or lot sales do notoccur on a timely basis or are less than current expectations, our revenues,operating results, cash inflows and financial condition could be materiallyimpacted. 29 Significant competition in the real estate industry could have anadverse effect on our business. The homebuilding industry is highly competitive.  We face competition from other developers onthe island of Hawaii, and from other luxury residential properties in Hawaiiand the mainland United States.  In manycases, our competitors have greater financial and other resources, moreestablished market positions, better opportunities for land acquisitions andhave lower costs of capital, labor and material than we do.  If we are unable to compete with these largercompetitors, our financial results could be adversely affected. We have limited experience in the homebuilding industry. Homebuilding is a new business segment for us and weare relying to a material extent on our business partners to help us executeour business plan. We may need additional financing to fund our real estate developmentactivities.  If we are unable to obtainsufficient financing or such financing is obtained on adverse terms, we may notbe able to operate our business as planned, which could adversely affect ourresults of operations and future growth. The real estate development industry is capitalintensive and homebuilding requires significant up-front expenditures toacquire land and begin development. Accordingly, we will incur substantial indebtedness to finance our homebuildingactivities.  Although we believe thatinternally generated funds and borrowing capacity under our credit facilitywill be sufficient to fund our development and construction activities, theamounts available from such sources may not be adequate to meet our needsespecially in the tight credit market. Additionally, we will need to establish new funding sources to financeour land acquisition capital expenditures. If such sources are not sufficient, we would seek additional capital inthe form of debt or equity financing from a variety of potential sources,including additional bank financing, joint venture partner financing, and/orsecurities offerings.  The amount andtypes of indebtedness which we may incur are limited by the terms of theagreements governing our existing debt. In addition, the availability of borrowed funds to be utilized for landacquisition, development and construction may be greatly reduced, and thelending community may require increased amounts of equity to be invested in aproject by borrowers in connection with both new loans and the extension ofexisting loans.  The failure to obtainsufficient capital to fund our planned capital and other expenditures couldhave a material adverse effect on our business. Our operating results from homebuilding are expected to be variable. Due to the cyclical nature of the real estatedevelopment industry, we expect to experience variability in our futureoperating results on a quarterly and an annual basis.  Factors expected to contribute to this variabilityinclude, among other things:·                  the timing ofland acquisitions and permitting;·                  the timing ofhome closings, land sales and level of home sales;·                  our ability tocontinue to acquire additional land or options thereon on acceptable terms;·                  the conditionof the real estate market and the general economy; and·                  delays inconstruction due to natural disasters, adverse weather, reduced contractoravailability and strikes. 30 Forexample, the timing of land acquisitions and permitting impacts our ability topursue the development of new housing projects in accordance with our businessplan.  If the timing of land acquisitionsor zoning or regulatory approvals is delayed, we will be delayed in ourability to develop housing projects, which would likely decrease ourbacklog.  Furthermore, these delays couldresult in a decrease in our revenues and earnings for the periods in which thedelays occur and possibly subsequent periods until the planned housing projectscan be completed.  A delay in asignificant number of home closings or land sales due to natural disasters,adverse weather or contractor availability would have a similar impact onrevenues and earnings for the period in which the delays occur.  Further, revenues may increase in subsequentperiods over what would normally be expected as a result of increased homeclosings as the delays described above are resolved. Changes in the governmentregulations applicable to homebuilders could restrict our business activities,increase our operating expenses and cause our revenues to decline. Regulatory requirements applicable to homebuilderscould cause us to incur significant liabilities and operating expenses andcould restrict our business activities. We are subject to local, state and federal statutes and rules regulating,among other things, certain developmental matters, building and site design,and matters concerning the protection of worker health and safety, and the environment.  Our operating expenses may be increased bygovernmental regulations, such as building permit allocation ordinances, impactand other fees and taxes, which may be imposed to defray the cost of providingcertain governmental services and improvements. Other governmental regulations, such as building moratoriums and nogrowth or slow growth initiatives, which may be adopted in communitieswhich have developed rapidly, may cause delays in our home projects orotherwise restrict our business activities resulting in reductions in ourrevenues.  Any delay or refusal to grantus necessary licenses, permits or approvals from government agencies couldcause substantial increases to development costs or cause us to abandon theproject and to sell the affected land at a potential loss, which in turn couldharm our operating results. Ourresidential real estate segment is dependent on the continued availability andsatisfactory performance of our building contractors, which,if unavailable, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We conduct our construction operations throughunaffiliated building contractors.  As aconsequence, we depend on the continued availability of and satisfactoryperformance by the contractors for the construction of our homes.  There may not be sufficient availability ofand satisfactory performance by the contractors.  If the contractors quality of work is notsufficient to assist us in home construction, our ability to construct homes onthe schedule we have planned would be affected. This could result in an increase in our costs to construct homes in atimely manner, which could result in an increase in our overall costs and thusa decline in our margins and in our net income. Further, non-timely completion of work could affect our ability to sellhomes based upon our projected timeline thus possibly affecting our ability toobtain additional financing to continue our homebuilding efforts. Shortages of labor ormaterials and/or increases in the price of materials could delay constructionor increase the cost of home construction thereby reducing our sales andearnings. The homebuilding business has from time to timeexperienced building material and labor shortages, as well as volatility in theprices of certain materials, including lumber, framing, drywall and  31 cement,which are significant components of home construction costs.  These labor and material shortages can bemore severe during periods of strong demand for housing or during periods wherethe area in which we operate experiences natural disasters that have asignificant impact on existing residential and commercial structures.  Shortages and price increases could causedelays in and increase our costs of home construction, which in turn could harmour operating results. Themarket value of our real estate interests could drop significantly, which mayrequire write-downs of the carrying value of our real estate held fordevelopment and investment to its estimated fair value.  Any write-downs would negatively impact ourresults of operations and financial condition. The risk of owning developed and undeveloped land canbe substantial for homebuilders. Homebuilding requires that we acquire land forreplacement and expansion of land inventory within our existing and newmarkets.  The risks inherent inpurchasing and developing land increase as consumer demand for housingdecreases.  Thus, we may have bought anddeveloped land which we cannot profitably sell or on which we cannot profitablybuild and sell homes.  The market valueof land, buildable lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly asa result of changing economic market conditions.  It is possible that the measures we employ tomanage inventory risks will not be successful and as a result our operationsmay suffer.  In addition, inventorycarrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorlyperforming market.  Prevailing market conditions maysignificantly influence the market value of our residential lots held fordevelopment and/or our residential parcels held for investment.  In the event of significant changes ineconomic or market conditions, we may have to sell homes or land inventory atsignificantly lower margins or at a loss. Furthermore, if the marketconditions continue to deteriorate, we may be required to write-down thecarrying value of our real estate held for development and investment to itsestimated fair value.  Such write-downswould have a negative impact on our results of operations and financialcondition. Severe weather and othernatural conditions or disasters may disrupt or delay construction and mayimpair the value of our real estate property. Severe weather and other natural conditions ordisasters, such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes,tornadoes, volcanic activity, droughts, floods, and heavy or prolonged rain,can negatively affect our operations by requiring us to delay or haltconstruction or to perform potentially costly repairs to our projects underconstruction and to unsold homes. Further, these conditions can delay home closings, adversely affect thecost or availability of materials or labor, or impair the value of the propertyon a temporary or permanent basis.  To the extent our insurance is not adequateto cover business interruption losses or repair costs resulting from theseevents, our total earned revenues and earnings may be adversely affected. The homebuilding industryis highly competitive and, with more limited resources than some of ourcompetitors, we may not be able to compete effectively. The homebuilding industry is highly competitive.  Homebuilders compete for, among other things,desirable land, financing, raw materials, skilled labor and purchasers.  We compete for residential sales on the basisof a number of interrelated factors, including location, reputation, amenities,design, quality and price, with numerous homebuilders, including somehomebuilders with greater financial resources and/or lower costs than us.  Increased competition could also reduce thenumber of homes we deliver, reducing our revenues, or cause us to acceptreduced margins to maintain  32 salesvolumes.  A reduction in our revenue ormargins due to competitive factors could affect our ability to service ourdebt, including the credit facilities. Risks Related to ContractDrilling Segment Demand for water well drilling and/or pumpinstallation is volatile.  A decrease indemand for our services could adversely affect our revenues and results ofoperations. Demand for services is highly dependent upon landdevelopment activities in the state of Hawaii. As also noted above, the real estate development industry is cyclical innature and is particularly vulnerable to shifts in local, regional, andnational economic conditions outside of our control such as interest rates,housing demand, population growth, employment levels and job growth andproperty taxes.  If we experience adecrease in water well drilling and/or pump installation contracts, we mayexperience decreased revenues and operating results. A significant portion ofour contract drilling business is dependent on municipalities and a decline inmunicipal spending could adversely impact our business. A significant portion of our contract drillingdivision revenues are derived from water and infrastructure contracts withgovernmental entities or agencies. Reduced tax revenues in certain regions may limit spending and newdevelopment by local municipalities which in turn will affect the demand forour services in these regions.  Materialreductions in spending by a significant number of municipalities or local governmentalagencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results ofoperations, liquidity and financial position. Our contract drillingoperations face significant competition from companies with greater financialresources. We face competition for our services from a variety ofcompetitors.  Many of our competitorsutilize drilling rigs that drill as quickly as our equipment but require lesslabor.  Our strategy is to compete basedon pricing and to a lesser degree, quality of service.  If we are unable to compete effectively withour competitors, our financial results could be adversely affected. The loss of or damage tokey vendor, customer or sub-contractor relationships would adversely affect ouroperations. Our business is dependent on our relationships withkey vendors, customers and subcontractors. The loss of or damage to any of our key relationships could negativelyaffect our business. Entity-Wide Risks The financial crisis may have impacts on our business and financialcondition that we currently cannot predict. The ongoing credit crisisand turmoil in the global financial system may have an impact on our businessand our financial condition, and we may face challenges if conditions in thefinancial markets do not improve.  Ourability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would 33 like, or need, to raise capital, which could have animpact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and businessconditions.  The economic situation couldadversely affect the demand for real estate development activities in the stateof Hawaii which in turn could cause a decline in the water well drilling and/orpump installation services required. Furthermore, weak market conditions could cause a decrease in demand forluxury homes.  Additionally, the currenteconomic situation could lead to reduced demand for oil and natural gas, orlower prices for natural gas and oil, or both, which could have a negative impacton our revenues. We are reliant upon future cash flows from operations, land investmentsegment development rights and percentage of sales proceeds, and availablecredit as a source of liquidity.  Ifestimated cash inflows do not occur timely or are less than currentexpectations, our liquidity may be negatively impacted. In addition to cash flows from oil and natural gas andcontract drilling operations, we rely upon land investment segment developmentrights and percentage of sales payment proceeds as a source of liquidity.  However, oil and natural gas prices have beenhistorically volatile and the timing and amount of land investment segmentpercentage of sales proceeds are unpredictable, may be sporadic, and are notunder our control.  Development rightsproceeds, on the other hand, are scheduled but there is no assurance thatfuture monies will be received. Wealso have a credit facility with a Canadian bank that is denominated inCanadian dollars.  Any decreases incurrency exchange rates affect the amount of credit available to us.  Furthermore, our real estate revolving creditfacilitys loan advance limitation is subject to the underlying securitysappraised value.  Any decreases in theappraised value of the underlying security could reduce the amount of creditavailable to us. Accordingly, if estimated cash inflows do not occur ona timely basis or are less than current expectations or if we are subject to reductions in available credit, ourrevenues, operating results, cash inflows and financial condition could bematerially impacted. Our future level ofindebtedness and the terms of our financing arrangements may adversely affectour operations, financial condition and limit our growth. At September 30, 2008, we had long-termindebtedness of approximately $26.2 million. In the ordinary course of business, we may incur significant additionaldebt, to the extent permitted by our revolving credit facilities, in order tofund future capital expenditures, acquisitions and homebuilding activities. The terms of our revolving credit facilities imposerestrictions on our ability and, in some cases, the ability of our subsidiariesto take a number of actions that we may otherwise desire to take, including oneor more of the following:·                  incurring additional debt, includingguarantees of indebtedness;·                  making investments;·                  creating liens on our assets; and·                  selling assets. 34 Our level of indebtedness and the covenants containedin our financing agreements could have important consequences.  For example, it could:·                  limit our ability to obtain future financing,through equity offerings or debt financings, for working capital, capitalexpenditures, acquisitions, refinancing of indebtedness or general corporateand other activities;·                  require us to dedicate a substantial portionof our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thereby reducing ourability to use our cash flow for other purposes (i.e., working capital, capitalexpenditures, and other general business activities);·                  limit our flexibility in planning for, orreacting to, the changes in our business;·                  subject us to higher costs and morerestrictive covenants in the future for working capital, capital expenditures,acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes, if additional financing isobtained;·                  make us vulnerable to increases in interestrates as our revolving credit facilities are subject to variable interestrates;·                  detract from our ability to successfullywithstand a downturn in our business or the economy generally;·                  place us at a competitive disadvantagebecause we have more debt than some of our competitors; and·                  make us more vulnerable to general economicdownturns and adverse developments in our industries, especially declines inoil and natural gas prices, and the economy in general. We may incur additional debt, including significantsecured indebtedness, or issue additional stock in order to fund capitalexpenditures, make future acquisitions, and develop our properties.  A higher level of indebtedness increases therisk that we may default on our obligations. Our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level ofindebtedness depends on our future performance. General economic conditions, oil and natural gas prices and financial,business and other factors affect our operations and our futureperformance.  Many of these factors arebeyond our control.  Factors that willaffect our ability to raise cash through a refinancing of our debt includefinancial market conditions, the value of our assets and our performance at thetime we need capital. In addition, our bank borrowing base on our Canadianrevolving credit facility is subject to periodic redetermination.  A lowering of our borrowing base couldrequire us to repay indebtedness in excess of the borrowing base, or we mayneed to further secure the lenders with additional collateral. The price of our commonstock has been volatile and could continue to fluctuate substantially. The market price of our common stock has been volatileand could fluctuate based on a variety of factors, including:·                  fluctuations in commodity prices;·                  variations in results of operations;·                  announcements by us and our competitors;·                  legislative or regulatory changes;·                  general trends in the industry;·                  general market conditions; and·                  analysts estimates and other events in theoil and natural gas industry. 35 Failure to retain keypersonnel could hurt our operations. We require highly skilled and experienced personnel tooperate our business.  In addition tocompeting in highly competitive industries, we compete in a highly competitivelabor market.  Our business could beadversely affected by an inability to retain personnel or upward pressure onwages as a result of the highly competitive labor market. A small number ofstockholders, including our executive officers, own a significant amount of ourcommon stock and have influence over our business regardless of the oppositionof other stockholders. As of September 30, 2008, two of our investorsand our executive officers held approximately 44% of our common stock.  Theinterests of these stockholders may not always coincide with the interests ofother stockholders.  These stockholders,acting together, have significant influence over all matters submitted to ourstockholders, including the election of our directors, and could accelerate,delay, deter or prevent a change of control of us.  These stockholders are able to exercisesignificant control over our business, policies and affairs. We believe that therequirement to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in fiscal2010 and the possible requirement to comply in fiscal 2009 will result inadditional expenses and may divert managements attention. The Company may become an accelerated filer as definedin Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would requirethe Company to comply with the Section 404(b) auditor attestation ofthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act for fiscal 2009; we are currently required to comply infiscal 2010.  In such event, our independentregistered public accounting firm would be required to provide its attestationof the adequacy of the Companys internal controls.  If such compliance is required, the Companyanticipates incurring additional general and administrative expenses andanticipates that its compliance efforts may divert managements time andattention away from other aspects of our business. Adverse changes inactuarial assumptions used to calculate retirement plan costs due to economicor other factors, or lower returns on plan assets could adversely affectBarnwells results and financial condition. Retirement plan cash funding obligations and planexpenses and obligations are subject to a high degree of uncertainty and couldincrease in future years depending on numerous factors, including theperformance of the financial markets, specifically the equity markets, and thelevels of interest rates. We are involved in jointventures and are subject to risks associated with joint venture partnerships. We are involved in joint venture relationships and mayinitiate future joint venture projects. Entering into a joint venture involves certain risks which include:·                  the inability to exercise voting control overthe joint venture;·                  economic or business interests which are notaligned with our venture partner; and·                  the inability for the venture partner tofulfill its commitments and obligations due to financial or other difficulties. 36 We may not be able to utilize allof our deferred tax assets. As of September 30, 2008, we had gross deferredtax assets of $10.0 million for which there was a valuation allowance of $5.9million.  Our deferred tax assets consistprimarily of foreign tax credit carryforwards, net operating losscarryforwards, excess of the cost basis of investment in land and residentialreal estate, and accruals and bad debt allowances that are not currentlydeductible for tax purposes.  Theultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon a variety offactors, including taxable income in prior carryback years, estimates of futuretaxable income, tax planning strategies and reversals of existing taxabletemporary differences.  Some or all ofthese deferred tax assets could expire unused if we are unable to generatetaxable income in the future sufficient to utilize them or we enter intotransactions that limit our right to use them. If a material portion of our deferred tax assets expire unused, it couldhave a material negative impact on our financial position or results ofoperations, which could have a material adverse affect on the Companysfinancial position, results of operations and cash flows. "
