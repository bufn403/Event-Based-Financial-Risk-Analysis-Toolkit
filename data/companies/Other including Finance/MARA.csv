2,MARA,MARATHON PATENT GROUP INC,2024-02-28,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSCertain factors may have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including the risk, factors, and uncertainties described under this Part I, Item 1A, and elsewhere in this Annual Report. This is not an exhaustive list, and there are other factors that may be applicable to our business that are not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. Any of these risks could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or prospects, which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. You should carefully consider the risks, factors, and uncertainties described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report, as well as the risk, factors, uncertainties, and other information we disclose in other filings we make with the SEC before making an investment decision regarding our securities.Risk Factor SummaryBelow is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our common stock speculative or risky. This summary does not address all of the risks we face. Additional discussion of the risks summarized in this risk factor summary, and other risks that we face, can be found below and should be carefully considered, together with other information included in this Annual Report.Risks Related to Our Business•Bitcoin prices are very volatile and this may affect our ability to effectively manage growth plans and our profitability;14Table of Contents•If we fail to grow our hash rate, we may be unable to compete, and our results of operations could suffer.•Fluctuations in the price of bitcoin may significantly influence the market price of our bitcoin holdings and therefore the price of our common stock;•Further significant disruptions in the crypto asset markets, such as those experienced in the second half of 2022, may cause further material impairment of the value and use of our mining rigs;•Political or economic crises may motivate large-scale sales of digital assets, which could result in a reduction in some or all digital assets’ values and adversely affect an investment in our securities;•Bitcoin is subject to halving and as such the reward for successfully solving a block will halve several times in the future and its value may not adjust to compensate us for the reduction in the rewards we receive from our mining efforts, which could cause us to cease our mining operations altogether and investors could suffer a complete loss of their investment;•Security threats to our business could result in a loss of our digital assets, or damage to our reputation and brand, each of which could adversely affect an investment in our securities;•The limited rights of legal recourse against us, and our lack of insurance protection exposes us and our stockholders to the risk of loss of our digital assets for which no person is liable;•We rely on third-party hosting, and as such, our operations could be adversely affected by the actions or inactions of such third-parties. Additionally, third-party hosting, among other things, often requires us to give the hosting company a first lien on the mining rigs installed on the site and creates business risk for us.•We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and may identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, which may result in material misstatements of our financial statements or cause us to fail to meet periodic reporting obligations; and•We have unresolved Staff comments which could result in restated financial statements.Risks Related to Governmental Regulation and Enforcement•Regulatory changes or actions may restrict the use of bitcoins or the operation of the Bitcoin network in a manner that adversely affects an investment in our securities;•Due to the unregulated nature and lack of transparency surrounding the operations of many bitcoin trading venues, they may experience fraud, security failures or operational problems, which may adversely affect the value of our bitcoin;•If regulatory changes or interpretations require the regulation of bitcoins under the Securities Act and the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Act”) by the SEC, we may be required to register and comply with such regulations. To the extent we decide to continue operations, the required registrations and regulatory compliance steps may result in extraordinary, non-recurring expenses to us. We may also decide to cease certain operations. Any disruption of our operations in response to the changed regulatory circumstances may be at a time that is disadvantageous to investors. This would likely have a material adverse effect on us and investors may lose their investment; and•Changing environmental regulation and public energy policy may expose our business to new risks.Risks Related to Our Common Stock •Our stock price is volatile; and•Because there has been limited precedent set for financial accounting of bitcoin and other cryptocurrency assets, the determination that we have made for how to account for cryptocurrency assets transactions may be subject to change.15Table of ContentsRisks Related to Our BusinessBitcoin prices are highly volatile, which may affect our ability to effectively manage growth plans and our profitability.The price of bitcoin is extremely volatile and in fiscal 2023 the price range of bitcoin was between approximately $16,600 and $42,300. The cost to mine a bitcoin is independent of the then current price of bitcoin, so when prices are low, the cost per coin to mine may consume much of our available cash, which means that there is less capital with which to invest in future company growth. Similarly, when prices are low, our profitability is decreased on a dollar-for-dollar basis correlated to the then price of bitcoin. Given the volatility of bitcoin, these factors render us unable to accurately predict in advance what our growth plans may be and accurately forecast any revenue and profitability projections for any reporting period.The price of bitcoin may be influenced by regulatory, commercial, and technical factors that are highly uncertain.Bitcoin and other digital assets are relatively novel and are subject to various risks and uncertainties that may adversely impact their price. For example, the application of securities laws and other regulations to such assets is unclear in certain respects, and it is possible that regulators in the United States or foreign countries may create new regulations or interpret laws in a manner that adversely affects the price of bitcoin. The growth of the digital assets industry in general, and the use and acceptance of bitcoin in particular, may also impact the price of bitcoin and is subject to a high degree of uncertainty. The pace of worldwide growth in the adoption and use of bitcoin could depend on the following:•public familiarity with digital assets;•ease of buying and accessing bitcoin;•institutional demand for bitcoin as an investment asset;•consumer demand for bitcoin as a means of payment; and•the availability and popularity of alternatives to bitcoin.Even if growth in bitcoin adoption occurs in the near or medium-term, there is no assurance that bitcoin usage will continue to grow over the long-term. Because bitcoin has no physical existence beyond the record of transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, a variety of technical factors related to the Bitcoin blockchain could also impact the price of bitcoin. For example, malicious attacks by “miners” who validate bitcoin transactions, inadequate mining fees to incentivize validating of bitcoin transactions, “hard forks” of the Bitcoin blockchain, and advances in quantum computing could undercut the integrity of the Bitcoin blockchain and negatively affect the price of bitcoin. The liquidity of bitcoin may also be reduced and damage to the public perception of bitcoin may occur, if financial institutions were to deny banking services to businesses that hold bitcoin, provide bitcoin-related services or accept bitcoin as payment, which could also decrease the price of bitcoin.Fluctuations in the price of bitcoin may significantly influence the market price of our bitcoin holdings and therefore, the price of our common stock.To the extent investors view the value of our common stock as linked to the value or change in the value of our bitcoin, fluctuations in the price of bitcoin may significantly influence the market price of our common stock.If we fail to grow our hash rate, we may be unable to compete, and our results of operations could suffer.Generally, a bitcoin miner’s chance of solving a block on the Bitcoin blockchain and earning a bitcoin reward is a function of the miner’s hash rate (i.e., the amount of computing power devoted to supporting the Bitcoin blockchain), relative to the global network hash rate. As greater adoption of Bitcoin occurs, we expect the demand for Bitcoin will increase further, drawing more mining companies into the industry and thereby increasing the global network hash rate. As new and more powerful miners are deployed, the global network hash rate will continue to increase, meaning a miner’s chance of earning bitcoin rewards will decline unless it deploys additional hash rate at pace with the industry. Accordingly, to maintain our chances of earning new bitcoin rewards and remaining competitive in our industry, we must seek to continually add new miners to grow our hash rate at pace with the growth in the Bitcoin global network hash rate. However, as demand has increased and scarcity in the supply of new miners has resulted, the price of new 16Table of Contentsminers has increased sharply, and we expect this process to continue in the future as demand for bitcoin increases. Therefore, if the price of bitcoin is not sufficiently high to allow us to fund our hash rate growth through new miner acquisitions and if we are otherwise unable to access additional capital to acquire these miners, our hash rate may stagnate and we may fall behind our competitors. If this happens, our chances of earning new bitcoin rewards would decline and, as such, our results of operations and financial condition may suffer.Further significant disruptions in the crypto asset markets, such as those experienced in the second half of 2022, may cause further material impairment of the value and use of our mining rigs.During the fourth quarter of 2022, the per coin price of bitcoin reached a low of approximately $15,500 from a high of almost $21,500 earlier in the quarter. This decrease in the price of bitcoin, combined with general market sentiment caused in large part by the collapse of FTX Trading Ltd. (“FTX”) in November 2022 and various bitcoin company-related bankruptcies and restructurings, led to a material decline in the fair value of our mining rigs and deposits for future mining rig purchases during that period. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $332.9 million on these assets during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, although operations were unaffected and continued throughout the period. Any future decrease in the value of bitcoin could cause us to record additional impairments in the value of our current and future assets. In addition, if bitcoin prices dropped to levels below that experienced in 2022 and held at those levels for a significant period of time, it could impact our profitability such that we would possibly need to consider whether it would be prudent to leave certain of our mining rigs idle until the price of bitcoin recovered. Theoretically, there is a minimum bitcoin price that is so low that we would be incentivized to cease our mining operations, particularly where our operating costs exceed our revenues. However, this is a complex projection involving multiple ever-changing, dynamic variables. We have multiple mining sites and hosting partners, all with different hosting prices, electricity prices, and contract structures. These costs would need to be compared to the current revenue being produced by our mining rigs.Geopolitical or economic crises may create increased uncertainty and price changes, or motivate large-scale sales of digital assets, which could result in a reduction in some or all digital assets’ values and adversely affect an investment in our securities.As an alternative to fiat currencies that are backed by central governments, digital assets such as bitcoin, which are relatively new, are subject to supply and demand forces based upon the desirability of an alternative, decentralized means of buying and selling goods and services. It is unclear how such supply and demand will be impacted by geopolitical events. Nevertheless, geopolitical or economic crises may motivate large-scale acquisitions or sales of digital assets either globally or locally. Large-scale sales of digital assets would result in a reduction in their value and could adversely affect an investment in our securities.In addition, we are subject to price volatility and uncertainty due to geopolitical crises and economic downturns. Such geopolitical crises and global economic downturns may be a result of invasion, or possible invasion, by one nation of another, leading to increased inflation and supply chain volatility. Such crises, as well as inflation, will likely continue to have an effect on our ability to do business in a cost-effective manner.The sale of our digital assets to pay expenses at a time of low digital asset prices could adversely affect an investment in our securities.We may sell our digital assets to pay expenses on an as-needed basis, irrespective of then-current prices. Consequently, our digital assets may be sold at a time when the prices on the respective digital asset exchange market are low, which could adversely affect an investment in our securities. The development and acceptance of digital asset networks and other digital assets, which represent a new and rapidly changing industry, are subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate. The slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of digital asset systems may adversely affect an investment in our securities.Digital assets such as bitcoin, that may be used, among other things, to buy and sell goods and services are a new and rapidly evolving industry. The growth of the digital asset industry in general, and the digital asset networks of bitcoin in particular, are highly uncertain. The factors affecting the further development of the digital asset industry, as well as the digital asset networks, include:•continued worldwide growth in the adoption and use of bitcoins and other digital assets;17Table of Contents•government and quasi-government regulation of bitcoins and other digital assets and their use, or restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation of the digital asset network or similar digital assets systems;•the maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of the Bitcoin network;•changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;•the availability and popularity of other forms or methods of buying and selling goods and services, including new means of using fiat currencies;•general economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to digital assets;•the impact of regulators focusing on digital assets and digital securities and the costs associated with such regulatory oversight; and•a decline in the popularity or acceptance of the digital asset networks of bitcoin, or similar digital asset systems, could adversely affect an investment in our securities.The open-source structure of the Bitcoin network protocol means the contributors to the protocol are generally not directly compensated for their contributions in maintaining and developing the protocol. A failure to properly monitor and upgrade the protocol could damage the Bitcoin network and an investment in our securities. Digital asset networks are open-source projects and, although there is an influential group of leaders in, for example, the Bitcoin network community known as the “Core Developers,” there is no official developer or group of developers that formally controls the Bitcoin network. As an open-source project, Bitcoin is not represented by an official organization or authority. The Bitcoin network protocol is not sold and contributors are generally not compensated for maintaining and updating the Bitcoin network protocol. The lack of guaranteed financial incentive for contributors to maintain or develop the Bitcoin network and the lack of guaranteed resources to adequately address emerging issues with the Bitcoin network may reduce incentives to address the issues adequately or in a timely manner. Changes to a digital asset network in which we are directing our mining efforts may adversely affect an investment in our securities.The acceptance of digital asset network software patches or upgrades by a significant, but not overwhelming, percentage of the users and miners in any digital asset network could result in a “fork” in the respective blockchain, resulting in the operation of two separate networks until such time as the forked blockchains are merged. The temporary or permanent existence of forked blockchains could adversely impact an investment in our securities.Due to Bitcoin’s open-source project, any individual can download the Bitcoin network software and make any desired modifications, which are proposed to users and miners on the Bitcoin network through software downloads and upgrades, and typically posted to the Bitcoin development forum on GitHub.com. A substantial majority of miners and Bitcoin users must consent to those software modifications by downloading the altered software or upgrade that implements the changes. If not, the changes do not become a part of the Bitcoin network. Since the Bitcoin network’s inception, changes to the Bitcoin network have been accepted by the vast majority of users and miners, ensuring that the Bitcoin network remains a coherent economic system. However, a developer or group of developers could potentially propose a modification to the Bitcoin network that is not accepted by a vast majority of miners and users, but that is nonetheless accepted by a substantial population of participants in the Bitcoin network. In such a case, and if the modification is material and/or not backwards compatible with the prior version of Bitcoin network software, a fork in the blockchain could develop and two separate Bitcoin networks could result with one running the pre-modification software program and the other running the modified version (i.e., a second “Bitcoin” network). Such a fork in the blockchain is typically addressed by community-led efforts to merge the forked blockchains, and several prior forks have been so merged. This kind of split in the Bitcoin network could materially and adversely impact an investment in our securities and harm the sustainability of the Bitcoin network’s economy. As the number of digital assets awarded for solving a block in the blockchain decreases, the incentive for miners to continue to contribute processing power to the respective digital asset network will transition from a set reward to transaction fees. Either the requirement from miners of higher transaction fees in exchange for recording transactions in the blockchain or a software upgrade that automatically charges fees for all transactions may decrease demand for digital assets and prevent the expansion of the digital asset networks to retail merchants and 18Table of Contentscommercial businesses, resulting in a reduction in the price of digital assets that could adversely impact an investment in our securities. In order to incentivize miners to continue to contribute processing power to any digital asset network, such network may either formally or informally transition from a set reward to transaction fees earned upon solving for a block. This transition could be accomplished either by miners independently electing to record in the blocks they solve only those transactions that include payment of a transaction fee or by the digital asset network adopting software upgrades that require the payment of a minimum transaction fee for all transactions. If transaction fees paid for digital asset transactions become too high, the marketplace may be reluctant to accept digital assets as a means of payment and existing users may be motivated to switch from one digital asset to another digital asset or back to fiat currency. Decreased use and demand for bitcoins that we have accumulated may adversely affect its value and may adversely impact an investment in it. To the extent that any miners cease to record transactions in solved blocks, transactions that do not include the payment of a transaction fee will not be recorded on the blockchain until a block is solved by a miner who does not require the payment of transaction fees. Any widespread delays in the recording of transactions could result in a loss of confidence in that digital asset network, which could adversely impact an investment in our securities.To the extent that any miners cease to record transaction in solved blocks, such transactions will not be recorded on the blockchain. Currently, there are no known incentives for miners to actively not record transactions in solved blocks. However, to the extent that any such incentives arise (e.g., a collective movement among miners or one or more mining pools forcing bitcoin users to pay transaction fees as a substitute for or in addition to the award of new bitcoins upon the solving of a block), actions of miners solving a significant number of blocks could delay the recording and confirmation of transactions on the blockchain. Any systemic delays in the recording and confirmation of transactions on the blockchain could result in greater exposure to double-spending transactions and a loss of confidence in certain or all digital asset networks, which could adversely impact an investment in our securities. If a malicious actor or botnet obtains control in excess of 50% of the processing power active on any digital asset network, including the Bitcoin network, it is possible that such actor or botnet could manipulate the blockchain in a manner that adversely affects an investment in our securities.If a malicious actor or botnet (a volunteer or hacked collection of computers controlled by networked software coordinating the actions of the computers) obtains a majority of the processing power dedicated to mining on any digital asset network, it may be able to alter the blockchain by constructing alternate blocks if it is able to solve for such blocks faster than the remainder of the miners on the blockchain can add valid blocks. Within the alternate blocks, the malicious actor or botnet could control, exclude or modify the ordering of transaction. However, it could not generate new digital assets or transactions using such control. Using alternate blocks, the malicious actor or botnet could “double-spend” its own digital assets (i.e., spend the same digital assets in more than one transaction) and prevent the confirmation of other users’ transactions for so long as it maintains control. To the extent that such malicious actor or botnet does not yield its majority control of the processing power or the digital asset community does not reject the fraudulent blocks as malicious, reversing any changes made to the blockchain may not be possible. Such changes could adversely affect an investment in our securities.The approach towards and possible crossing of the 50% threshold indicates a greater risk that a single mining pool could exert authority over the validation of digital asset transactions. To the extent that the digital assets ecosystems do not act to ensure greater decentralization of digital asset mining processing power, the feasibility of a malicious actor obtaining in excess of 50% of the processing power on any digital asset network (e.g., through control of a large mining pool or through hacking such a mining pool) will increase, which may adversely impact an investment in our securities.Bitcoin is subject to halving, and as such the reward for successfully solving a block will halve several times in the future and its value may not adjust to compensate us for the reduction in the rewards we receive from our mining efforts, which could cause us to cease our mining operations altogether and investors could suffer a complete loss of their investment.Halving is a process designed to control the overall supply and reduce the risk of inflation in digital assets using a Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm. In an event referred to as bitcoin “halving,” the bitcoin reward for mining any block is cut in half. For example, the mining reward for bitcoin declined from 12.5 to 6.25 bitcoin on May 11, 2020. This process is scheduled to occur once every 210,000 blocks. It is estimated that bitcoin will next halve in April 2024 and then approximately every four years thereafter, until the total amount of bitcoin rewards issued reaches 21.0 million, and the theoretical supply of new Bitcoin is exhausted, which is expected to occur around 2140. Once 21.0 million bitcoin are generated, the network will stop producing more. Currently, there are more than 19.0 million bitcoin in circulation. While bitcoin prices have had a history of price fluctuations around halving events, there is no 19Table of Contentsguarantee that any such price change will be favorable or would compensate for the reduction in mining reward. If a corresponding and proportionate increase in the price of bitcoin does not follow these anticipated halving events, the revenue from our mining operations would decrease, and we may not have an adequate incentive to continue mining and may cease mining operations altogether, which may adversely affect an investment in our securities and investors could suffer a complete loss of their investment.Furthermore, such reductions in bitcoin rewards for uncovering blocks may result in a reduction in the aggregate hash rate of the bitcoin network as the incentive for miners decreases. Miners ceasing operations would reduce the collective processing power on the network, which would adversely affect the confirmation process for transactions and make the bitcoin network more vulnerable to malicious actors or botnets obtaining control in excess of 50% of the processing power active on the blockchain. Such events may adversely affect our activities and an investment in our securities.To the extent that the profit margins of digital asset mining operations are not high, operators of digital asset mining operations are more likely to immediately sell their digital assets earned by mining in the digital asset exchange market, resulting in a reduction in the price of digital assets that could adversely impact an investment in our securities.Over the past two years, digital asset mining operations have evolved from individual users mining with computer processors, graphics processing units and first-generation mining rigs. Currently, new processing power brought onto the digital asset networks is predominantly added by “professionalized” mining operations. Professionalized mining operations may use proprietary hardware or sophisticated machines.Professionalized mining operations require:•the investment of significant capital for the acquisition of such hardware; •the leasing of operating space (often in data centers or warehousing facilities); •incurring of electricity costs; and •the employment of technicians to operate the mining farms. As a result, professionalized mining operations are of a greater scale than prior miners and have more defined, regular expenses and liabilities. These regular expenses and liabilities require professionalized mining operations to more immediately sell digital assets earned from mining operations on the digital asset exchange market. To the contrary, it is believed that past individual miners were more likely to hold mined digital assets for more extended periods. The immediate selling of newly mined digital assets greatly increases the supply of digital assets on the digital asset exchange market, creating downward pressure on the price of each digital asset.The extent to which the value of digital assets mined by a professionalized mining operation exceeds the allocable capital and operating costs determines the profit margin of such operation. A professionalized mining operation may be more likely to sell a higher percentage of its newly mined digital assets rapidly if it is operating at a low profit margin—and it may partially or completely stop operations if its profit margin is negative. In a low profit margin environment, a higher percentage could be sold into the digital asset exchange market more rapidly, potentially reducing digital asset prices. Lower digital asset prices may result in further tightening of profit margins, particularly for professionalized mining operations with higher costs and more limited capital reserves, creating a network effect that may further reduce the price of digital assets until mining operations with higher operating costs become unprofitable and remove mining power from the respective digital asset network. The network effect of reduced profit margins resulting in greater sales of newly mined digital assets could result in a reduction in the price of digital assets that could adversely impact an investment in our securities.Our reliance on immersion-cooling exposes us to additional risks. Our business is also active in Bitcoin-related projects related to the technological development of immersion-cooling, an emerging technology in bitcoin mining, which is not in wide-spread use in the bitcoin mining industry, and has yet to be deployed in large scale. As such, there is a risk we may not succeed in developing or deploying immersion-cooling at such a large scale to achieve sufficient cooling performance. Our bitcoin miners that utilize immersion-cooling technology do not primarily rely on the use of water. All Bitcoin mining infrastructure, including immersion-cooling and air-cooling, is an evolving study. Cooling of bitcoin miners in general is a risk to achieving full potential from our hash rate. 20Table of ContentsThe loss or destruction of a private key required to access a digital asset may be irreversible. Our loss of access to our private keys or a data loss relating to our digital assets could adversely affect an investment in our securities. Digital assets are controllable only by the possessor of both the unique public key and private key relating to the local or online digital wallet which hold the digital assets. We are required by the operators of digital asset networks to publish the public key relating to a digital wallet in use once we first verify a spending transaction from that digital wallet and broadcast such information into the respective network. We safeguard the private keys relating to our digital assets by relying on three custody providers, including New York Digital Investment Group LLC’s (“NYDIG”), relying on 100% cold-storage custody solutions held in purpose-built physically-secure environments based on established, industry best practices to safeguard digital assets from theft, loss, destruction or other issues relating to hackers and technological attack. To the extent a private key is lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised and no backup of the private key is accessible, we will be unable to access the digital assets and the private key will not be capable of being restored by the respective digital asset network. Any loss of private keys relating to digital wallets used to store our digital assets could adversely affect an investment in our securities.Security threats to our business could result in, a loss of our digital assets, or damage to our reputation and our brand, each of which could adversely affect an investment in our securities.Security breaches, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have been a prevalent concern in the digital asset exchange markets. A security breach caused by hacking, could include, but is not limited to: •efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems;•efforts to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment; and•the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses.A security breach by hacking could harm our operations or result in loss of our digital assets. Any breach of our and our partners’ infrastructure could result in reputational harm and erode the trust of our partners and stockholders, which could adversely affect an investment in our securities. Furthermore, as our assets grow, we may become a more appealing target for security threats such as hackers and malware.We rely on third-party custody providers’ 100% cold-storage custody solutions held in a purpose-built physically secure environments based on established, industry best practices to safeguard digital assets from theft, loss, destruction or other issues relating to hackers and technological attack. Notwithstanding the safeguards implemented to protect our assets, the third-party security systems may not be impenetrable or free from defect, and any loss due to a security breach, software defect or event outside of our control will be borne by us.The security system and operational infrastructure may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, error or malfeasance of an employee, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our private keys, data or bitcoins. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce our employees to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our infrastructure. Despite our efforts, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures since the hacking techniques used are often not recognized until launched against a target. If an actual or perceived breach of our security system occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our controls could be harmed, which could adversely affect an investment in our securities.Further, in the event of a security breach, we may be subject to litigation forced to cease operations, or suffer a reduction in assets, the occurrence of each of which could adversely affect an investment in our securities.Our ability to adopt technology in response to changing security needs or trends and our reliance on, third-party custody providers, poses a challenge to the safekeeping of our digital assets.The history of digital asset exchanges has shown that exchanges and large holders of digital assets must adapt to technological change in order to secure and safeguard their digital assets. We rely on third-party custody providers’ 100% cold-storage custody solutions held in a purpose-built physically secure environment based on established, industry best practices to safeguard digital assets from theft, loss, destruction or other issues relating to hackers and technological attack. We believe we may become a more appealing target of security threats as the size of our bitcoin holdings grow. To the extent that we, or any of our third-party custody providers, are unable to identify, mitigate or stop new security threats, our digital assets may be subject to theft, loss, destruction or other attack, which could adversely affect an 21Table of Contentsinvestment in our securities. To the extent that our third-party custody providers are no longer able to safeguard our assets due to the current banking crisis, we would be at risk of loss if safeguarding protocols fail.Digital asset transactions are irrevocable and stolen or incorrectly transferred digital assets may be irretrievable. As a result, any incorrectly executed digital asset transactions could adversely affect an investment in our securities.Digital asset transactions are not, from an administrative perspective, reversible without the consent and active participation of the recipient of the transaction or, in theory, control or consent of a majority of the processing power on that digital asset network. Once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to the blockchain, an incorrect transfer of digital assets or a theft of digital assets generally will not be reversible, and we may not be capable of seeking compensation for any such transfer or theft. Although we regularly transfer digital assets to or from vendors, consultants, services providers, it is possible that, through computer or human error, or through theft or criminal action, such assets could be transferred in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties. To the extent we are unable to seek a corrective transaction to identify the third party which has received our digital assets through error or theft, we will be unable to revert or otherwise recover the impacted digital assets, and any such loss could adversely affect an investment in our securities.The limited rights of legal recourse against us, and our lack of insurance protection expose us and our stockholders to the risk of loss of our digital assets for which no person is liable.Our digital assets are not insured. If our digital assets are lost, stolen or destroyed under circumstances rendering a party liable to us, the responsible party may not have the financial resources sufficient to satisfy our claim. For example, as to a particular event of loss, the only source of recovery for us might be limited to the extent identifiable, other responsible third parties (e.g., a thief or terrorist), any of which may not have the financial resources (including liability insurance coverage) to satisfy a valid claim. Furthermore, bitcoin is not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protection, which is the protection afforded to depositors at banking institutions. Therefore, a loss may be suffered with respect to our digital assets for which no recourse is available, which could adversely affect our operations and, consequently, an investment in our securities.If we or our third-party service providers experience a security breach or cyberattack and unauthorized parties obtain access to our bitcoin, we may lose some or all of our bitcoin and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Security breaches and cyberattacks are of particular concern with respect to our bitcoin. Bitcoin and other blockchain-based digital assets have been, and may in the future be, subject to security breaches, cyberattacks, or other malicious activities. A successful security breach or cyberattack could result in a partial or total loss of our bitcoin in a manner that may not be covered by insurance or indemnity provisions of the custody agreement with a custodian who holds our bitcoin. Such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We rely on third-party hosting, and as such, our operations could be adversely affected by the actions or inactions of such third-parties. Additionally, third-party hosting, among other things, often requires us to give the hosting company, a first lien on the mining rigs installed on the site and creates business risk for us. We do not self-host our mining rigs and rely upon third-party hosting facilities to power our mining rigs. Our third-party hosting operators host approximately 193,000 of our bitcoin miners or 23.91 of our operational hash rate capacity. Our operations and ability to mine bitcoin could be adversely affected if operators we rely on to operate our bitcoin miners experience general incompetence in performing their duties, experience financial difficulties or bankruptcy, or otherwise cannot operate our bitcoin miners in accordance with their contractual obligations. We are dependent upon the financial viability of our third-party hosting operators, and in 2022, several large publicly traded hosting companies met severe financial issues, including bankruptcies. For example, our largest hosting partner, Compute North, filed for bankruptcy in 2022, and as a result, we recorded an impairment charge in the amount of $55.7 million. Currently, about 90% of our third-party hosting is operated by APLD and Hut 8. As a result, our operations are highly dependent on these third-parties and could be adversely affected by the actions or inactions of our third-party hosting operators.Furthermore, in most hosting contracts, there is a requirement that the miner agrees to permit the hosting company to place a lien on the actual mining machines being hosted. If the hosting company files for bankruptcy, it may take 22Table of Contentsmonths for the liens to be lifted, while the bankruptcy court and parties litigate these contracts and resolves issues as to ownership of assets and related areas. In these contracts, we are often required to make significant deposits against future mining fees. If the hosting party utilizes the deposits, we could risk loss of the deposits and be left with an unsecured claim in the bankruptcy. Lastly, as the bankruptcy process includes an automatic stay in favor of the debtor company, until the stay is lifted or a bankruptcy plan approved, we may not be able to move our mining rigs to a different location, even if the debtor rejects our hosting contract.Intellectual property rights claims may adversely affect the operation of some or all digital asset networks. Third parties may assert intellectual property claims relating to the holding and transfer of digital assets and their source code. Regardless of the merit of any intellectual property or other legal action, any threatened action that reduces confidence in some or all digital asset networks’ long-term viability or the ability of end-users to hold and transfer digital assets may adversely affect an investment in our securities. Additionally, a meritorious intellectual property claim could prevent us and other end-users from accessing some or all digital asset networks or holding or transferring our digital assets. As a result, an intellectual property claim against us or other large digital asset network participants could adversely affect an investment in our securities.Variability in intellectual property laws may adversely affect our intellectual property position. Intellectual property laws, and patent laws and regulations in particular, have been subject to significant variability either through administrative or legislative changes to such laws or regulations or changes or differences in judicial interpretation, and it is expected that such variability will continue to occur. Additionally, intellectual property laws and regulations differ among states, and countries. Variations in patent laws and regulations or in interpretations of patent laws and regulations in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property and may change the impact of third-party intellectual property on our business. Accordingly, we cannot predict the scope of patents that may be granted to us, the extent to which we will be able to enforce our patents against third parties, or the extent to which third parties may be able to enforce their patents against us. We may seek to internally develop additional new inventions and intellectual property, which would take time and be costly. Moreover, the failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights for such inventions would lead to the loss of our investments in such activities. We may in the future seek to engage in commercial business ventures or seek internal development of new inventions or intellectual property. These activities would require significant amounts of financial, managerial and other resources and would take time to achieve. Such activities could also distract our management team from our present business initiatives, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business. There is also the risk that such initiatives may not yield any viable new business or revenue, inventions or technology, which would lead to a loss of investment in such activities. In addition, even if we are able to internally develop new inventions, in order for those inventions to be viable and to compete effectively, we would need to develop and maintain a proprietary position with respect to such inventions and intellectual property. However, there are significant risks associated with any such intellectual property we may develop principally including the following:•patent applications we may file may not result in issued patents or may take longer than we expect to result in issued patents;•we may be subject to interference proceedings;•we may be subject to opposition proceedings in the United States or foreign countries;•any patents that are issued to us may not provide meaningful protection;•we may not be able to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;•other companies may challenge patents issued to us;•other companies may have independently developed and/or patented (or may in the future independently develop and patent) similar or alternative technologies, or duplicate our technologies;•other companies may design around technologies we have developed; and•enforcement of our patents would be complex, uncertain and very expensive. 23Table of ContentsWe cannot be certain that patents, once issued, will provide us with adequate protection from competing products. For example, issued patents may be circumvented or challenged, declared invalid or unenforceable or narrowed in scope. In addition, since publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we will be the first to make our additional new inventions or to file patent applications covering those inventions. It is also possible that others may have or may obtain issued patents that could prevent us from commercializing our products or require us to obtain licenses requiring the payment of significant fees or royalties in order to enable us to conduct our business. As to those patents that we may acquire, our continued rights will depend on meeting any obligations to the seller and we may be unable to do so. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights for our inventions would lead to the loss of our investments in such activities, which would have a material adverse effect on our securities. Moreover, patent application delays could cause delays in recognizing revenue from our internally generated patents and could cause us to miss opportunities to license patents before other competing technologies are developed or introduced into the market. We are not actively pursuing any commercialization opportunities or internally generated patents. Our future success depends on our ability to expand our organization to match the growth of our activities. As our operations grow, the administrative demands and scaling demands upon us will grow, and our success will depend upon our ability to meet those demands. Both Marathon and each of our subsidiaries require certain financial, managerial and other resources, which could create challenges to our ability to successfully manage our subsidiaries and operations and impact our ability to assure compliance with our policies, practices and procedures. These demands include, but are not limited to, increased executive, accounting, management, legal services, staff support and general office services. We may need to hire additional qualified personnel to meet these demands, the cost and quality of which is dependent in part upon market factors outside of our control. Further, we will need to effectively manage the training and growth of our staff to maintain an efficient and effective workforce, and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business and operating results. Currently, we have limited personnel in our organization to meet our organizational and administrative demands. We are highly dependent on the continued services of our small team of executives.  We are dependent upon the efforts and services of our small executive team. While we have a preliminary plan for succession of certain key executive, the loss of any one of our key executives could have an adverse effect on our operations. We have engaged in, and in the future may engage in, strategic acquisitions and other arrangements that could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our stockholders, reduce our financial resources and harm our operating results.We have previously engaged in strategic transactions, including acquisitions of companies, miners, and bitcoin mining sites, such as our recent business acquisitions of two currently operational Bitcoin mining sites, totaling 390 megawatts of capacity, located in Granbury, Texas and Kearney, Nebraska, and, as part of our growth strategy, in the future, we may seek additional opportunities to grow our mining operations, including through purchases of miners, data centers and other facilities from other operating companies, including companies in financial distress. Our ability to grow through future acquisitions will depend on the availability of, and our ability to identify, suitable acquisition and investment opportunities at an acceptable cost, our ability to compete effectively to attract those opportunities and the availability of financing to complete acquisitions. Future acquisitions may require us to issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders’ percentage ownership, assume or otherwise be subject to liabilities of an acquired company, record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges, incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets, incur large acquisition and integration costs, immediate write-offs, and restructuring and other related expenses and become subject to litigation. The benefits of an acquisition or our expansion into may also take considerable time to develop, and we cannot be certain that any particular acquisition will produce the intended benefits in a timely manner or to the extent anticipated or at all. We may experience difficulties integrating the operations, technologies and personnel of an acquired company or be subjected to liability for the target’s pre-acquisition activities or operations as a successor in interest. Such integration may divert management’s attention from normal daily operations of our business. Future acquisitions may also expose us to potential risks, including risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience, especially when competitors in such markets have stronger market positions, the possibility of insufficient revenues to offset the expenses we incur in connection with an acquisition and the potential loss of, or harm to, our relationships with employees and suppliers as a result of integration of new businesses. 24Table of ContentsAdditionally, we may be unable to pursue our current acquisition strategy in the future. In addition to mining and holding bitcoin, and such related acquisitions, we have explored, and we may in the future explore, opportunities to become more involved in businesses that expand or supplement those directly related to the self-mining of bitcoin as favorable market conditions and opportunities arise. We cannot be certain that such opportunities will produce the intended benefits in a timely manner or to the extent anticipated or at all. These opportunities could also expose us to similar risks associated with our strategic acquisitions, as discussed above.Increased scrutiny and changing expectations from stockholders with respect to our environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) practices and the impacts of climate change may result in additional costs or risks.Companies across many industries are facing increasing scrutiny related to their ESG practices. Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds and other influential investors are also increasingly focused on ESG practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the non-financial impacts of their investments. In May 2021, the SEC proposed rule changes that would require public companies to include certain climate-related disclosures in their periodic reports, including information about climate-related risks that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on their business, results of operations, or financial condition, and certain climate-related financial statement metrics in a note to their audited financial statements. The SEC noted that such rule changes were proposed in response to investor demands for consistent and comparable data on climate change. Furthermore, increased public awareness and concern regarding environmental risks, including global climate change, may result in increased public scrutiny of our business and our industry, and our management team may divert significant time and energy away from our operations and towards responding to such scrutiny and reassuring our employees. In addition, the physical risks of climate change may impact the availability and cost of materials and natural resources, sources and supplies of energy, and demand for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and could increase our insurance and other operating costs, including, potentially, to repair damage incurred as a result of extreme weather events or to renovate or retrofit facilities to better withstand extreme weather events. If environmental laws or regulations or industry standards are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements on our operations, or if our operations are disrupted due to physical impacts of climate change, our business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position could be negatively impacted.Our business could be harmed by prolonged power and internet outages, shortages, or capacity constraints.Our operations require a significant amount of electrical power and access to high-speed internet to be successful. If we are unable to secure sufficient electrical power, or if we lose internet access for a prolonged period, we may be required to reduce our operations or cease them altogether. If this occurs, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. We may have further restrictions on our liquidity due to unique risks which we could face in 2024. The risks to our liquidity outlook would include the following: •deteriorating macroeconomic conditions such as the impact of inflation and increased interest rates and the corresponding impact on our ability to borrow funds or refinance existing indebtedness;•additional challenges arising from catastrophic events (such the FTX collapse and multiple bankruptcies of bitcoin mining companies in 2022 and 2023) that would adversely affect the credibility of, and therefore investor confidence in, companies engaged in the digital assets space;•additional declines in bitcoin prices and/or production, and increases in electricity costs which could adversely impact both the value of our bitcoin holdings and our ongoing profitability; and•further instability in the banking system and the possible collapse of more banking institutions which could put the liquidity and cash assets of third parties with which we do business such as miner hosting entities and suppliers and us, if we bank in the future with an institution which subsequently collapses.The termination of the $200.0 million in loan facilities with Silvergate Bank did not have a material impact on our operations or forecasts with regard to liquidity. The loans were fully collateralized by our holdings of bitcoin and as such, we were only permitted to borrow up to 65% of the value of the bitcoin held as collateral. Specific percentages and conditions are set forth in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under the caption, Bitcoin held as collateral for loans (“Digital assets, restricted”).25Table of ContentsIn response to the disruptions in the crypto markets and rising interest rates during the fourth quarter of 2022, we decided to move away from leverage and instead chose to rely on increased levels of cash and higher balances of unrestricted bitcoin holdings, which as of January 2023, we are now selling periodically as a means of generating cash for our operations. By selling bitcoin outright, we can realize 100% of the then value of our bitcoin when addressing liquidity needs. Refer to the disclosure under the caption “Liquidity and Capital Resources Outlook” in the section entitled (“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”) for further disclosure regarding our liquidity analysis. In measuring our prospective liquidity forecasts, we did not include loan availability given the loans were collateralized. In addition, we believe that with the consistently higher bitcoin mining levels which we have achieved, selling bitcoin is a more conservative and sustainable methodology for providing liquidity given current market conditions and interest rates. We believe that with the increased cash, access to our 2023 ATM and our intended 2024 ATM, as needed, our bitcoin holdings, and with periodic access to capital markets, we will have sufficient liquidity to fund operations and growth initiatives, including our investment in the ADGM Entity.In response to the closure of Signature Bank, we moved all of our cash to other FDIC insured institutions and did not suffer any loss of funds from this event. In order to help mitigate and avoid concentration risk with a single bank, we have diversified our cash holdings and now maintain cash management relationships at four commercial banking institutions. In addition, as a result of the current elevated risk of possible insolvency of banks, we have implemented a policy of purchasing short-term U.S. treasury bills as an additional means of risk mitigation for periods when our cash balances are higher than our near-term anticipated and planned operating cash flow needs.We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and may identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, which may result in material misstatements of our financial statements or cause us to fail to meet periodic reporting obligations.We are required to comply with certain provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404 requires that we document and test our internal control over financial reporting and issue management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. We assessed the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control — Integrated Framework. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Based on our assessment, as of December 31, 2023, we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting contained material weaknesses. To remediate these material weaknesses, our management has been implementing and continues to implement measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively.We believe that these actions will remediate such material weaknesses. However, the remediation cannot be deemed successful until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and our management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. If we fail to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, there may be materially adverse effects as to the accuracy and timeliness of the filing of our annual and quarterly reports, and it could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of customers, reduce our ability to obtain financing and require additional expenditures to comply with these requirements, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We have unresolved Staff comments.As stated in Item 1B of this Annual Report, we have unresolved Staff comments. For example, the Staff commented on our revenue recognition policy in our capacity as a pool operator and as a pool participant, with specific attention on our previous net recognition of revenue as an operator of a pool. In our restated financial results, we have revised our revenue to include gross revenue earned as a pool operator with any amounts remitted to third-party pool participants as cost of revenue. The Staff further commented on our accounting convention to recognize our noncash (bitcoin) revenue using fair value that is not at contract inception. We have evaluated the difference between our current accounting policy and fair value at contract inception and have determined that any differences in revenue are not material for all periods stated. We also received Staff comments relating to impairment of bitcoin, accounting for investment fund, statements of comprehensive income (loss) presentation, embedded leases in hosting and power 26Table of Contentsarrangements, investments, risk factors, and bitcoin as collateral. While we have restated our financial statements based on comments received to date and determinations reached with our auditors, these comments remain unresolved and are subject to further review and comment by the Staff. While we believe we have addressed all of the Staff’s concerns, until the Staff has completed its review, we have no assurance that unresolved comments, or additional comments from the Staff, will not result in the need for additional restatements of our previously issued financial statements. While we do not believe this is a likely result, if this were the case, we could be subject to a further restatement, which could result in loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, an adverse effect on the price of our common stock, and we could become subject to private litigation or to investigations or enforcement actions by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, all of which could require our expenditure of additional financial and management resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to raise capital. Risks Related to Governmental Regulation and EnforcementRegulatory changes or actions may restrict the use of bitcoins or the operation of the Bitcoin network in a manner that adversely affects an investment in our securities.Until recently, little or no regulatory attention has been directed toward bitcoin and the Bitcoin network by U.S. federal and state governments, foreign governments and self-regulatory agencies. As bitcoin has grown in popularity and in market size, the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Congress and certain U.S. agencies (e.g., the CFTC, the SEC, FinCEN and the Federal Bureau of Investigation) have begun to examine the operations of the Bitcoin network, bitcoin users and the bitcoin exchange market.Digital assets currently face an uncertain regulatory landscape in not only the United States but also in many foreign jurisdictions such as the European Union, China and Russia. While certain governments such as Germany, where the Ministry of Finance has declared bitcoin to be “Rechnungseinheiten” (a form of private money that is recognized as a unit of account, but not recognized in the same manner as fiat currency), have issued guidance as to how to treat bitcoin, most regulatory bodies have not yet issued official statements regarding intention to regulate or determinations on regulation of bitcoin, the Bitcoin network and bitcoin users. The effect of any future regulatory change on us, bitcoins, or other digital assets is impossible to predict, but such change could be substantial and adverse to us and could adversely affect an investment in our securities.Furthermore, one or more countries such as China and Russia may take regulatory actions in the future that severely restricts the right to acquire, own, hold, sell or use digital assets or to exchange digital assets for fiat currency. Such an action may also result in the restriction of ownership, holding or trading in the Company’s securities.Due to the unregulated nature and lack of transparency surrounding the operations of many bitcoin trading venues, they may experience fraud, security failures or operational problems, which may adversely affect the value of our bitcoin. Bitcoin trading venues are relatively new and, in some cases, unregulated. Furthermore, there are many bitcoin trading venues which do not provide the public with significant information regarding their ownership structure, management teams, corporate practices and regulatory compliance. As a result, the marketplace may lose confidence in bitcoin trading venues, including prominent exchanges that handle a significant volume of bitcoin trading. Negative perception, a lack of stability in the broader bitcoin markets and the closure or temporary shutdown of bitcoin trading venues due to fraud, business failure, hackers or malware, or government-mandated regulation may reduce confidence in bitcoin and result in greater volatility in the prices of bitcoin. To the extent investors view our common stock as linked to the value of our bitcoin holdings, such a negative perception of bitcoin trading venues could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock.  If regulatory changes or interpretations require the regulation of bitcoins under the Securities Act and Investment Company Act by the SEC, we may be required to register and comply with such regulations. To the extent that we decide to continue operations, the required registrations and regulatory compliance steps may result in extraordinary, non-recurring expenses to us. We may also decide to cease certain operations. Any disruption of our operations in response to the changed regulatory circumstances may be at a time that is disadvantageous to investors. This would likely have a material adverse effect on us and investors may lose their investment. Current and future legislation and the SEC rulemaking and other regulatory developments, including interpretations released by a regulatory authority, may impact the manner in which bitcoins are treated for classification and clearing purposes. The SEC’s July 25, 2017 Report expressed its view that digital assets may be securities depending on the facts and circumstances. As of the date of this Annual Report, the Company is not aware of any rules that have been proposed to regulate bitcoins as securities. We cannot be certain as to how future regulatory 27Table of Contentsdevelopments will impact the treatment of bitcoins under the law. Such additional registrations may result in extraordinary, non-recurring expenses, thereby materially and adversely impacting an investment in our common stock. If we determine not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, we may seek to cease certain of our operations. Any such action may adversely affect an investment in our securities. To the extent that digital assets including bitcoins and other digital assets we own or may own are deemed by the SEC to fall within the definition of a security, we may be required to register and comply with additional regulation under the Investment Act, including additional periodic reporting and disclosure standards and requirements and our registration as an investment company. Additionally, although we are not engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities, and we do not hold ourselves out as being engaged in those activities, we could inadvertently be deemed an investment company under the Investment Act. If we inadvertently are deemed an investment company and cannot rely on one of the exclusions under the Investment Act, then we would be required to register with the SEC.Furthermore, one or more states may conclude bitcoins and other digital assets we own or may own are a security under state securities laws which would require registration under state laws including merit review laws which would adversely impact us since we would likely not comply. As stated earlier in this Annual Report, some states including California define the term “investment contract” more strictly than the SEC. Such additional registrations, whether from regulatory developments or an inadvertent classification as an investment company, may result in extraordinary, non-recurring expenses for us, thereby materially and adversely impacting an investment in our securities. If we determine not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, we may seek to cease all or certain parts of our operations. Any such action would likely adversely affect an investment in our securities and investors may suffer a complete loss of their investment.  Our bitcoin holdings could subject us to regulatory scrutiny. Several bitcoin investment vehicles have attempted to list their shares on a U.S. national securities exchange to permit them to function in the manner of an ETF with continuous share creation and redemption at NAV. To date, the SEC has declined to approve any such listing, citing concerns over the surveillance of trading in markets for the underlying bitcoin as well as concerns about fraud and manipulation in bitcoin trading markets. Even though we do not function in the manner of an ETF, nor do we offer continuous share creation and redemption at NAV, it is possible that we could nevertheless face regulatory scrutiny from the SEC, as a company with securities traded on Nasdaq. In addition, as digital assets, including bitcoin, have grown in popularity and market size, there has been increasing focus on the extent to which digital assets can be used to launder the proceeds of illegal activities or fund criminal or terrorist activities, or entities subject to sanctions regimes. While we continue to maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to promote compliance with applicable anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and regulations and take care to only acquire our bitcoin through entities subject to anti-money laundering regulation and related compliance rules in the United States, if we are found to have purchased any of our bitcoin from bad actors that have used bitcoin to launder money or persons subject to sanctions, we may be subject to regulatory proceedings and further transactions or dealings in bitcoin may be restricted or prohibited. If regulatory changes or interpretations of our activities require us to register as a money services business (“MSB”) under the regulations promulgated by FinCEN under the authority of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, we may be required to register and comply with such regulations. If regulatory changes or interpretations of our activities require the licensing or other registrations as a money transmitter (or equivalent designation) under state law in any state in which we operate, we may be required to seek licensure or otherwise register and comply with such state law. In the event of any such requirement, to the extent we decide to continue, the required registrations, licensure and regulatory compliance steps may result in extraordinary, non-recurring expenses to us. We may also decide to cease our operations. Any termination of certain of our operations in response to the changed regulatory circumstances may be at a time that is disadvantageous to investors. To the extent that any of our activities cause us to be deemed an MSB, we may be required to comply with FinCEN regulations, including those that would mandate us to implement anti-money laundering programs, make certain reports to FinCEN and maintain certain records. To the extent that our activities cause us to be deemed a “money transmitter” (“MT”) or equivalent designation, under state law in any state in which we operate, we may be required to seek a license or otherwise register with a state regulator and comply with state regulations that may include the implementation of anti-money laundering programs, maintenance of certain records and other operational requirements. Currently, the NYSDFS has finalized its “BitLicense” framework for businesses that conduct “virtual currency business activity,” the Conference of State 28Table of ContentsBank Supervisors has proposed a model form of state level “virtual currency” regulation and additional state regulators including those from California, Idaho, Virginia, Kansas, Texas, South Dakota and Washington have made public statements indicating that virtual currency businesses may be required to seek licenses as money transmitters. In July 2016, North Carolina updated the law to define “virtual currency” and the activities that trigger licensure in a business-friendly approach that encourages companies to use virtual currency and blockchain technology. Specifically, the North Carolina law does not require miners or software providers to obtain a license for multi-signature software, smart contract platforms, smart property, colored coins and non-hosted, non-custodial wallets. Starting January 1, 2016, New Hampshire requires anyone who exchanges a digital asset for another currency must become a licensed and bonded money transmitter. In numerous other states, including Connecticut and New Jersey, legislation is being proposed or has been introduced regarding the treatment of bitcoin and other digital assets. We will continue to monitor for developments in such legislation, guidance or regulations.  Such additional federal or state regulatory obligations may cause us to incur extraordinary expenses, possibly affecting an investment our securities in a material and adverse manner. Furthermore, we and our service providers may not be capable of complying with certain federal or state regulatory obligations applicable to MSBs and MTs. If we are deemed to be subject to such obligations, and determine not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, we may act to dissolve and liquidate. Any such action may adversely affect an investment in our securities or result in a complete loss for our investors. Current interpretations require the regulation of bitcoins under the CEA by the CFTC, we may be required to register and comply with such regulations. To the extent that we decide to continue operations, the required registrations and regulatory compliance steps may result in extraordinary, non-recurring expenses to us. We may also decide to cease certain operations. Any disruption of our operations in response to the changed regulatory circumstances may be at a time that is disadvantageous to investors. Current and future legislation, CFTC and other regulatory developments, including interpretations released by a regulatory authority, may impact the manner in which bitcoins are treated for classification and clearing purposes. In particular, bitcoin derivatives are not excluded from the definition of “commodity future” by the CFTC. We cannot be certain as to how future regulatory developments will impact the treatment of bitcoins under the law. Bitcoins have been deemed to fall within the definition of a commodity, and we may be required to register and comply with additional regulations under the CEA, including additional periodic reports and disclosure standards and requirements. Moreover, we may be required to register as a commodity pool operator and to register the Company as a commodity pool with the CFTC through the National Futures Association. Such additional registrations may result in extraordinary, non-recurring expenses, thereby materially and adversely impacting an investment in our securities. If we determine not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, we may seek to cease certain aspects of our operations. Any such action may adversely affect an investment in our securities. If federal or state legislatures or agencies initiate or release tax determinations that change the classification of bitcoins as property for tax purposes (in the context of when such bitcoins are held as an investment), such determination could have a negative tax consequence on us or our stockholders. Current IRS guidance indicates that digital assets such as bitcoin should be treated and taxed as property, and that transactions involving the payment of bitcoin for goods and services should be treated as barter transactions. While this treatment creates a potential tax reporting requirement for any circumstance where the ownership of a bitcoin passes from one person to another, usually by means of bitcoin transactions (including off-blockchain transactions), it preserves the right to apply capital gains treatment to those transactions which may adversely affect an investment in our securities.Our interactions with the bitcoin network may expose us to specially designated nationals (“SDN”) or blocked persons or cause us to violate provisions of law that did not contemplate distributed ledger technology.The Office of Financial Assets Control (“OFAC”) of the U.S. Department of Treasury requires us to comply with its sanction program and not conduct business with persons named on its SDN list. However, because of the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions we may inadvertently and without our knowledge engage in transactions with persons named on OFAC’s SDN list. Our policy prohibits any transactions with such SDN individuals, and we take all commercially reasonable steps to avoid such transactions, but we may not be adequately capable of determining the ultimate identity of the individual with whom we transact with respect to selling cryptocurrency assets. Moreover, there is a risk that some bad actors will continue to attempt to use cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, as a potential means of avoiding federally imposed sanctions, such as those imposed in connection with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 29Table of ContentsWe are unable to predict the nature or extent of new and proposed legislation and regulation affecting the cryptocurrency industry, or the potential impact of the use of cryptocurrencies by SDN or other blocked or sanctioned persons, which could have material adverse effects on our business and our industry more broadly. Further, we may be subject to investigation, administrative or court proceedings, and civil or criminal monetary fines and penalties as a result of any regulatory enforcement actions, all of which could harm our reputation and affect the value of our common stock.Changing environmental regulation and public energy policy may expose our business to new risks.Our bitcoin mining operations require a substantial amount of power and can only be successful, and ultimately profitable, if the costs we incur, including for electricity, are lower than the revenue we generate from our operations. As a result, any mine we establish can only be successful if we can obtain sufficient electrical power for that mine on a cost-effective basis, and our establishment of new mines requires us to find locations where that is the case. For instance, our plans and strategic initiatives for expansion are based, in part, on our understanding of current environmental and energy regulations, policies and initiatives enacted by federal and state regulators. If new regulations are imposed, or if existing regulations are modified, the assumptions we made underlying our plans and strategic initiatives may be inaccurate, and we may incur additional costs to adapt our planned business, if we are able to adapt at all, to such regulations. In addition, there continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty for our business because the bitcoin mining industry, with its high energy demand, may become a target for future environmental and energy regulation. New legislation and increased regulation regarding climate change could impose significant costs on us and our suppliers, including costs related to increased energy requirements, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting, and other costs to comply with such regulations. Further, any future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. For example, some bitcoin miners operating primarily in the State of Texas have recently received a mandatory survey from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (the “EIA”), seeking extensive information regarding our facilities’ use of electricity, and certain information regarding operations. It is possible that mandatory surveys such as this will be used by the EIA to generate negative reports regarding the bitcoin mining industry’s use of power and other resources, which could spur additional negative public sentiment and adverse legislative and regulatory action against us or the Bitcoin mining industry as a whole. Surveys and other regulatory actions could increase our cost of operations or otherwise make it more difficult for us to operate are our current locations. Given the political significance and uncertainty around the impact of climate change and how it should be addressed, we cannot predict how legislation and regulation will affect our financial condition and results of operations. Further, even without such regulation, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about potential impacts on climate change by us or other companies in our industry could harm our reputation. Any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.We have commenced doing business overseas, and different countries have differing degrees of political, legal and fiscal stability. This exposes us to a wide range of political developments that could result in changes to contractual terms, laws and regulations. In addition, we, and our joint arrangements and associates, face the risk of litigation and disputes worldwide. Developments in politics, laws and regulations can and do affect our operations. Potential impacts include: •forced divestment of assets;•expropriation of property;•cancellation or forced renegotiation of contract rights;•additional taxes including windfall taxes; •restrictions on deductions and retroactive tax claims;•antitrust claims;•changes to trade compliance regulations; •price controls; 30Table of Contents•local content requirements; •foreign exchange controls; •changes to environmental regulations; •changes to regulatory interpretations and enforcement; and •changes to disclosure requirements. Any of these, individually or in aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition. From time to time, social and political factors play a role in unprecedented and unanticipated judicial outcomes that could adversely affect our business. Non-compliance with policies and regulations could result in regulatory investigations, litigation and, ultimately, sanctions. Certain governments and regulatory bodies have, in our opinion, exceeded their constitutional authority by: •attempting unilaterally to amend or cancel existing agreements or arrangements; •failing to honor existing contractual commitments; and •seeking to adjudicate disputes between private litigants. Additionally, certain governments have adopted laws and regulations that could potentially force us to violate other countries’ laws and regulations, therefore potentially subjecting us to both criminal and civil sanctions. Such developments and outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.We are subject to an extensive, highly evolving and uncertain regulatory and business landscape and any adverse changes to, or our failure to comply with, any laws and regulations, and adverse business reactions from counterparties could adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, operating results, and financial condition.Our business is subject to: •extensive laws; •rules, regulations; •policies;•orders; •determinations; •directives; •treaties; •legal and regulatory interpretations and guidance; and•counterparty risk in the markets in which we operate.Counterparty risk in the markets in which we operate includes:•regulatory aspects from financial services;•federal energy and other regulators; •the SEC; 31Table of Contents•the CFTC; •credit, crypto asset custody; •exchange, and transfer;•cross-border and domestic money and crypto asset transmission;•consumer and commercial lending;•usury; •foreign currency exchange; •privacy; •data governance; •data protection; •cybersecurity; •fraud detection; •antitrust and competition; •bankruptcy;•tax; •anti-bribery; •economic and trade sanctions; •anti-money laundering, and counter-terrorist financing; •the same regulatory risks applicable to counterparties which are most notably hosting businesses; and•the recent economic issues and bankruptcies befalling some in this industry. Many of these legal and regulatory regimes were adopted prior to the advent of the internet, mobile technologies, crypto assets, and related technologies. As a result, some applicable laws and regulations do not contemplate or address unique issues associated with the crypto economy, are subject to significant uncertainty, and vary widely across U.S. federal, state, and local and international jurisdictions. These legal and regulatory regimes, including the laws, rules, and regulations thereunder, evolve frequently and may be modified, interpreted, and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another, and may conflict with one another. Moreover, the complexity and evolving nature of our business and the significant uncertainty surrounding the regulation of the crypto economy requires us to exercise our judgment as to whether certain laws, rules, and regulations apply to us, and it is possible that governmental bodies and regulators may disagree with our conclusions. To the extent we have not complied with such laws, rules, and regulations, we could be subject to significant fines, revocation of licenses, limitations on our products and services, reputational harm, and other regulatory consequences, each of which may be significant and could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.Additionally, various governmental and regulatory bodies, including legislative and executive bodies, in the United States and in other countries may adopt new laws and regulations, the direction and timing of which may be influenced by changes in the governing administrations and major events in the crypto economy. For example, following the failure of several prominent crypto trading venues and lending platforms, such as FTX, Celsius Networks, Voyager and Three Arrows Capital in 2022 (even though these do not directly affect our business), the 32Table of ContentsU.S. Congress expressed the need for both greater federal oversight of the crypto economy and comprehensive cryptocurrency legislation. In the near future, various governmental and regulatory bodies, including in the United States, may introduce new policies, laws, and regulations relating to crypto assets, the crypto economy, and crypto asset platforms. The failures of risk management and other control functions at other companies that played a role in these events could accelerate an existing regulatory trend toward stricter oversight of crypto asset platforms and the crypto economy.Due to our business activities, we may be subject to ongoing examinations, oversight, and reviews and currently are, and expect to be, subject to investigations and inquiries, by U.S. federal and state regulators, many of which have broad discretion to audit and examine our business. Moreover, new laws, regulations, or interpretations may result in additional litigation, regulatory investigations, and enforcement or other actions, including preventing or delaying it from offering certain products or services offered by our competitors or could impact how we offer such products and services. Adverse changes to, or our failure to comply with, any laws and regulations have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, operating results, and financial condition.Risks Relating to Our Common Stock Our stock price is volatile. The market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:•changes in our industry including changes which adversely affect bitcoin and other digital assets;•changes in bitcoin pricing;•competitive pricing pressures;•our ability to obtain working capital financing;•additions or departures of key personnel;•sales of our common stock;•our ability to execute our business plan;•operating results that fall below expectations;•loss of any strategic relationship;•regulatory developments; and•economic and other external factors.In addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.Exercise or conversion of warrants and other convertible securities, along with new issuances of our common stock, will dilute our stockholder’s percentage of ownership. We have issued convertible securities, options and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock to our officers, directors, consultants and certain stockholders. In the future, we may grant additional options, warrants and convertible securities. The exercise, conversion or exchange of options, warrants or convertible securities, including for other securities, will dilute the percentage ownership of our stockholders. The dilutive effect of the exercise or conversion of these securities may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional capital. The holders of these securities may be expected to exercise or convert such options, warrants and convertible securities at a time when it would be able to obtain additional equity capital on terms more favorable than such securities or when our common stock is trading at a price higher than the exercise or conversion price of the securities. The exercise or conversion of outstanding warrants, options and convertible securities will have a dilutive effect on the securities held by our 33Table of Contentsstockholders. We have in the past, and may in the future, exchange outstanding securities for other securities on terms that are dilutive to the securities held by other stockholders not participating in such exchange. Additionally, our stockholders have experienced dilution through the issuance of our common stock under the 2022 ATM and the 2023 ATM, and in the event we sell any shares of our common stock under the 2024 ATM, our stockholders will continue to experience dilution. Because there has been limited precedent set for financial accounting of bitcoin and other cryptocurrency assets, the determination that we have made for how to account for cryptocurrency assets transactions may be subject to change.Because there has been limited precedent set for the financial accounting of cryptocurrencies and related revenue recognition, it is unclear how companies may in the future be required to account for cryptocurrency transactions and assets and related revenue recognition. A change in regulatory or financial accounting standards could result in the necessity to change our accounting methods and restate our financial statements. Such a restatement could adversely affect the accounting for our newly mined cryptocurrency rewards and more generally negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Such circumstances would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations as well as and potentially the value of any cryptocurrencies we hold or expect to acquire for our own account and harm our investors.We have never paid nor do we expect in the near future to pay cash dividends. We have never paid cash dividends on our capital stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. While it is possible that we may declare a dividend after a large settlement, investors should not rely on such a possibility, nor should they rely on an investment in our securities if they require income generated from dividends paid on our capital stock. Any income derived from our common stock would only come from rise in the market price of our common stock, which is uncertain and unpredictable. Offers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline. If our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market upon the expiration of any statutory holding period or lockup agreements, under Rule 144, or issued upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or other convertible securities, it could create a circumstance commonly referred to as an “overhang” and in anticipation of which the market price of our common stock could fall. The existence of an overhang, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could make more difficult our ability to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that it deems reasonable or appropriate. The shares of our restricted common stock will be freely tradable upon the earlier of: (i) effectiveness of a registration statement covering such shares; and (ii) the date on which such shares may be sold without registration pursuant to Rule 144 (or other applicable exemption) under the Securities Act of 1933. "
1,MARA,MARATHON PATENT GROUP INC,2017-04-05,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS There are numerous and varied risks, known and unknown, that may prevent us from achieving our goals. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operation may be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment. Risks Related to Our Company We have changed the focus of our business to acquiring patents and patent rights and monetizing the value of those assets through enforcement campaigns that are expected to generate revenue.  We may not be able to successfully monetize the patents that we acquire and thus we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions. There is no assurance that we will be able to continue to successfully acquire, develop or monetize our patent portfolio. The acquisition of patents could fail to produce anticipated benefits or there could be other adverse effects that we do not currently foresee. Failure to successfully monetize our patents would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the acquisition of patent portfolios is subject to a number of risks, including, but not limited to the following: ·                  There is a significant time lag between acquiring a patent portfolio and recognizing revenue from such patent asset. During such time lag, substantial amounts of costs are likely to be incurred that could have a negative effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position;·                  The monetization of a patent portfolio is a time consuming and expensive process that may disrupt our operations. If our monetization efforts are not successful, our results of operations could be harmed. In addition, we may not achieve anticipated synergies or other benefits from such acquisition; and·                  We may encounter unforeseen difficulties with our business or operations in the future that may deplete our capital resources more rapidly than anticipated. As a result, we may be required to obtain additional working capital in the future through public or private debt or equity financings, borrowings or otherwise. If we are required to raise additional working capital in the future, such financing may be unavailable to us on favorable terms, if at all, or may be dilutive to our existing stockholders. If we fail to obtain additional working capital, as and when needed, such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Therefore, there is no assurance that the monetization of our patent portfolios will generate enough revenue to recoup our investment. We presently rely upon the patent assets we acquire from other patent owners. If we are unable to monetize such assets and generate revenue and profit through those assets or by other means, there is a significant risk that our business would fail. When we commenced our current line of business in 2012, we acquired a portfolio of patent assets from Sampo IP, LLC (Sampo), a company affiliated with our Chief Executive Officer, Douglas Croxall, from which we have generated revenue from enforcement activities and for which we plan to continue to generate enforcement related revenue.  On April 16, 2013, we acquired a patent from Mosaid Technologies Incorporated, a Canadian corporation. On April 22, 2013, we acquired a patent portfolio through a merger between our wholly-owned subsidiary, CyberFone Acquisition Corp., a Texas corporation and CyberFone Systems LLC, a Texas limited liability company (CyberFone Systems). In June 2013, in connection with the closing of a licensing agreement with Siemens Technology, we acquired a patent portfolio from that company.  In September 2013, we acquired a portfolio from TeleCommunication Systems and an additional portfolio from Intergraph Corporation.  In October 2013, we acquired a patent portfolio from TT IP, LLC.  In December 2013, we engaged in three transactions: (i) in connection with a licensing agreement with Zhone, we acquired a portfolio of patents from that company; (ii) we acquired a patent portfolio from Delphi Technologies, Inc.; and (iii) in connection with a settlement and license agreement, we agreed to settle and release a defendant for past and future use of our patents, whereby the defendant agreed to assign and transfer two U.S. patents and rights to us.  In May 2014, we acquired ownership rights of Dynamic Advances, LLC, a Texas limited liability company, IP Liquidity Ventures, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and Sarif Biomedical, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, all of which hold patent portfolios or contract rights to the revenue generated from patent portfolios. In June 2014, we acquired Selene Communication Technologies, LLC, which holds multiple patents in the search and network intrusion field.  In August 2014, we acquired patents from Clouding IP LLC, with such patents related to network and data management technology. In September 2014, we acquired TLI Communications, which owns a single patent in the telecommunication field. In October 2014, we acquired three patent portfolios from MedTech Development, LLC, which owns medical technology patents. In June 2016, we acquired two patent portfolios from Siemens covering W-CDMA and GSM cellular technology. In July 2016, we acquired a patent portfolio from Siemens covering internet-of-things technology. In August 2016, entered into two transactions.  In the first, we acquired a patent portfolio from CPT IP Holdings, LLC covering battery technology and in the second, we entered into a Patent Funding and Exclusive License Agreement with a Fortune 50 company to monetize more than 10,000 patents in a single industry vertical. In September 2016, we acquired a patent from Cirrex Systems, LLC covering LED technology. We plan to generate revenues from our acquired patent portfolios.  However, if our efforts to generate revenue from these assets fail, we will have incurred significant losses and may be unable to acquire additional assets. If this occurs, our business would likely fail. 5Table of Contents We have economic interests in patent portfolios that the Company does not control and the decision regarding the timing and amount of licenses are held by third parties, which could lead to outcomes materially different than what the Company intended. The Company owns contract rights to two patent portfolios over which it does not exercise control and cannot determine when and if, and if so, for how much, the patent owner licenses the patents.  This could lead to situations where we have dedicated resources, time and money to portfolios that, despite the best interests of the Company, provide little or no return on our investment.  In these situations, the Company would record a loss on its investment and incur losses that contribute to the overall performance of the Company and could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition. Failure to effectively manage our growth could place strains on our managerial, operational and financial resources and could adversely affect our business and operating results. Our growth has placed, and is expected to continue to place, a strain on our limited managerial, operational and financial resources and systems. Further, as our subsidiary companies businesses grow, we will be required to continue to manage multiple relationships. Any further growth by us or our subsidiary companies, or an increase in the number of our strategic relationships, may place additional strain on our managerial, operational and financial resources and systems. Although we may not grow as we expect, if we fail to manage our growth effectively or to develop and expand our managerial, operational and financial resources and systems, our business and financial results would be materially harmed. We initiate legal proceedings against potentially infringing companies in the normal course of our business and we believe that extended litigation proceedings would be time-consuming and costly, which may adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to operate our business. To monetize our patent assets, we generally initiate legal proceedings against potential infringing companies, pursuant to which we may allege that such companies infringe on one or more of our patents. Our viability could be highly dependent on the outcome of the litigation, and there is a risk that we may be unable to achieve the results we desire from such litigation, which failure would substantially harm our business.  In addition, the defendants in the litigations are likely to be much larger than us and have substantially more resources than we do, which could make our litigation efforts more difficult and impact the duration of the litigation which would require us to devote our limited financial, managerial and other resources to support litigation that may be disproportionate to the anticipated recovery. We anticipate that these legal proceedings may continue for several years and may require significant expenditures for legal fees and other expenses. Disputes regarding the assertion of patents and other intellectual property rights are highly complex and technical. Once initiated, we may be forced to litigate against others to enforce or defend our patent rights or to determine the validity and scope of other partys patent rights. The defendants or other third parties involved in the lawsuits in which we are involved may allege defenses and/or file counterclaims or commence re-examination proceedings by patenting issuance authorities in an effort to avoid or limit liability and damages for patent infringement, or declare our patents to be invalid or non-infringed. If such defenses or counterclaims are successful, they may preclude our ability to derive monetization revenue from the patents we own. A negative outcome of any such litigation, or an outcome which affects one or more claims contained within any such litigation, could materially and adversely impact our business. Additionally, we anticipate that our legal fees and other expenses will be material and will negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations and may result in our inability to continue our business. Variability in intellectual property laws may adversely affect our intellectual property position. Intellectual property laws, and patent laws and regulations have been subject to significant variability either through administrative or legislative changes to such laws or regulations or changes or differences in judicial interpretation, and it is expected that such variability will continue to occur. Additionally, intellectual property laws and regulations differ among countries. Variations in the patent laws and regulations or in interpretations of patent laws and regulations in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property and may change the impact of third-party intellectual property on us. Accordingly, we cannot predict the scope of patents that may be granted to us, the extent to which we will be able to enforce our patents against third parties, or the extent to which third parties may be able to enforce their patents against us. 6Table of Contents We may seek to internally develop additional new inventions and intellectual property, which would take time and be costly. Moreover, the failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights for such inventions would lead to the loss of our investments in such activities. We may in the future seek to engage in commercial business ventures or seek internal development of new inventions or intellectual property. These activities would require significant amounts of financial, managerial and other resources and would take time to achieve. Such activities could also distract our management team from its present business initiatives, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business. There is also the risk that such initiatives may not yield any viable new business or revenue, inventions or technology, which would lead to a loss of our investment in such activities. In addition, even if we are able to internally develop new inventions, in order for those inventions to be viable and to compete effectively, we would need to develop and maintain, and we would be heavily reliant upon, a proprietary position with respect to such inventions and intellectual property. However, there are significant risks associated with any such intellectual property we may develop principally including the following: ·                                          patent applications we may file may not result in issued patents or may take longer than we expect to result in issued patents;·                                          we may be subject to interference proceedings;·                                          we may be subject to opposition proceedings in the U.S. or foreign countries;·                                          any patents that are issued to us may not provide meaningful protection;·                                          we may not be able to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;·                                          other companies may challenge patents issued to us;·                                          other companies may have independently developed and/or patented (or may in the future independently develop and patent) similar or alternative technologies, or duplicate our technologies;·                                          other companies may design around technologies we have developed; and·                                          enforcement of our patents would be complex, uncertain and very expensive. We cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any future patent applications, or that any of our patents, once issued, will provide us with adequate protection from competing products. For example, issued patents may be circumvented or challenged, declared invalid or unenforceable or narrowed in scope. In addition, since publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we will be the first to make our additional new inventions or to file patent applications covering those inventions. It is also possible that others may have or may obtain issued patents that could prevent us from commercializing our products or require us to obtain licenses requiring the payment of significant fees or royalties in order to enable us to conduct our business. As to those patents that we may acquire, our continued rights will depend on meeting any obligations to the seller and we may be unable to do so. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights for our inventions would lead to the loss of our investments in such activities, which would have a material adverse effect on us. Moreover, patent application delays could cause delays in recognizing revenue from our internally generated patents and could cause us to miss opportunities to license patents before other competing technologies are developed or introduced into the market. Our future success depends on our ability to expand our organization to match the growth of our activities. As our operations grow, the administrative demands upon us will grow, and our success will depend upon our ability to meet those demands. We are organized as a holding company, with numerous subsidiaries. Both the parent company and each of our subsidiaries require certain financial, managerial and other resources, which could create challenges to our ability to successfully manage our subsidiaries and operations and impact our ability to assure compliance with our policies, practices and procedures. These demands include, but are not limited to, increased executive, accounting, management, legal services, staff support and general office services. We may need to hire additional qualified personnel to meet these demands, the cost and quality of which is dependent in part upon market factors outside of our control. Further, we will need to effectively manage the training and growth of our staff to maintain an efficient and effective workforce, and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business and operating results. Potential acquisitions may present risks, and we may be unable to achieve the financial or other goals intended at the time of any potential acquisition. Our future growth depends in part on our ability to acquire patented technologies, patent portfolios or companies holding such patented technologies and patent portfolios. Accordingly, we have engaged in acquisitions to expand our patent portfolios and we intend to continue to explore such acquisitions. Such acquisitions are subject to numerous risks, including, but not limited to the following: ·                                          our inability to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to any potential acquisition, or if we are able to enter into such agreement, our inability to consummate the potential acquisition; 7Table of Contents ·                                        difficulty integrating the operations, technology and personnel of the acquired entity including achieving anticipated synergies;·                                          our inability to achieve the anticipated financial and other benefits of the specific acquisition;·                                          difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during the transition and monetization process;·                                          diversion of our managements attention from other business concerns; and·                                          failure of our due diligence process to identify significant issues, including issues with respect to patented technologies and patent portfolios and other legal and financial contingencies. If we are unable to manage these risks effectively as part of any acquisition, our business could be adversely affected. Our revenues are unpredictable, and this may harm our financial condition. From November 12, 2012 to the present, our operating subsidiaries have executed our business strategy of acquiring patent portfolios and accompanying patent rights and monetizing the value of those assets.  As of December 31, 2016, on a consolidated basis, our operating subsidiaries owned 515 patents and had economic rights to over 10,000 additional patents, both of which include U.S. patents and certain foreign counterparts, covering technologies used in a wide variety of industries. These acquisitions continue to expand and diversify our revenue generating opportunities. However, due to the nature of our patent monetization business and uncertainties regarding the amount and timing of the receipt of funds from the monetization of our patent assets resulting in part from uncertainties regarding the outcome of enforcement actions, rates of adoption of our patented technologies, outlook for the businesses for defendants, and certain other factors, our revenues may vary substantially from quarter to quarter, which could make our business difficult to manage, adversely affect our business and operating results, cause our quarterly results to fall below expectations and adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock. Our patent monetization cycle is lengthy and costly, and our marketing, legal and administrative efforts may be unsuccessful. We expect significant marketing, legal and administrative expenses prior to generating revenue from monetization efforts.  We will also spend considerable time and resources educating defendants on the benefits of a settlement, prior to or during litigation, that may include issuing a license to our patents and patent rights.  As such, we may incur significant losses in any particular period before revenue streams commence. If our efforts to convince defendants of the benefits of a settlement arrangement prior to litigation are unsuccessful, we may need to continue with the litigation process or other enforcement action to protect our patent rights and to realize revenue from those rights.  We may also need to litigate to enforce the terms of existing license agreements, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Enforcement proceedings are typically protracted and complex. The costs are typically substantial, and the outcomes are unpredictable. Enforcement actions will divert our managerial, technical, legal and financial resources from business operations. Our exposure to uncontrollable risks, including new legislation, court rulings or actions by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), could adversely affect our activities including our revenues, expenses and results of operations. Our patent acquisition and monetization business is subject to numerous risks including new legislation, regulations and rules. If new legislation, regulations or rules are implemented either by Congress, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the executive branch, or the courts, that impact the patent application process, the patent enforcement process, the rights of patent holders, or litigation practices, such changes could materially and negatively affect our revenue and expenses and, therefore, our results of operations and the overall success of our Company.  On March 16, 2013, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act or the America Invents Act became effective. The America Invents Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. In general, the legislation attempts to address issues surrounding the enforceability of patents and the increase in patent litigation by, among other things, establishing new procedures for patent litigation. For example, the America Invents Act changes the way that parties may be joined in patent infringement actions, increasing the likelihood that such actions will need to be brought against individual allegedly-infringing parties by their respective individual actions or activities. In addition, the America Invents Act enacted a new inter-partes review, or IPR, process at the USPTO which can be used by defendants, and other individuals and entities, to separately challenge the validity of any patent. At this time, it is not clear what, if any, impact the America Invents Act will have on the operation of our patent monetization and enforcement business. However, the America Invents Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of our patented technologies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.  Patents from nine of our portfolios are currently the subject of inter-partes reviews. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm expresses substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Our auditors have indicated in their report on the Companys financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 that conditions exist that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to our recurring losses from operations and substantial decline in our working capital. A going concern opinion could impair our ability to finance our operations through the sale of equity, incurring debt, or other financing alternatives. Our ability to continue as a going concern will depend upon the availability and terms of future funding, continued growth in product orders and shipments, improved operating margins and our ability to profitably meet our after-sale service commitments with existing customers.  If we are unable to achieve these goals, our business would be jeopardized and the Company may not be able to continue. 8Table of Contents  In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice, or the DOJ, has conducted reviews of the patent system to evaluate the impact of patent assertion entities on industries in which those patents relate. It is possible that the findings and recommendations of the DOJ could impact the ability to effectively monetize and enforce standards-essential patents and could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of any such patented technologies. Also, the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, has published its intent to initiate a proposed study under Section 6(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act to evaluate the patent assertion practice and market impact of Patent Assertion Entities, or PAEs.  The FTCs notice and request for public comment relating to the PAE study appeared in the Federal Register on October 3, 2013. The FTC solicited information from the Company regarding its portfolios and activities, and the Company complied with the FTC request for such information. The results of the PAE study by the FTC were provided to Congress and other agencies, such as the DOJ, who could take action, including legislative proposals, based on the results of the study. Finally, new rules regarding the burden of proof in patent enforcement actions could substantially increase the cost of our enforcement actions and new standards or limitations on liability for patent infringement could negatively impact our revenue derived from such enforcement actions. Changes in patent laws could adversely impact our business. Patent laws may continue to change and may alter the historically consistent protections afforded to owners of patent rights. Such changes may not be advantageous for us and may make it more difficult for us to obtain adequate patent protection to enforce our patents against infringing parties. Increased focus on the growing number of patent-related lawsuits may result in legislative changes that increase our costs and related risks of asserting patent enforcement actions. Trial judges and juries often find it difficult to understand complex patent enforcement litigation, and as a result, we may need to appeal adverse decisions by lower courts in order to successfully enforce our patent rights. It is difficult to predict the outcome of litigation, particularly patent enforcement litigation. It is often difficult for juries and trial judges to understand complex, patented technologies and, as a result, there is a higher rate of successful appeals in patent enforcement litigation than more standard business litigation. Such appeals are expensive and time consuming, resulting in increased costs and delayed final non-appealable judgments that can require payment of damages to the Company. Although we diligently pursue enforcement litigation, we cannot predict with significant reliability the decisions that may be made by juries and trial courts. More patent applications are filed each year resulting in longer delays in getting patents issued by the USPTO. We hold and continue to acquire pending patents in the application or review phase. We believe there is a trend of increasing patent applications each year, which we believe is resulting in longer delays in obtaining approval of pending patent applications. The application delays could cause delays in monetizing such patents which could cause us to miss opportunities to license patents before other competing technologies are developed or introduced into the market. The length of time required time to litigate an enforcement action is increasing. Our patent enforcement actions are almost exclusively prosecuted in federal court. Federal trial courts that hear our patent enforcement actions also hear criminal and other cases. Criminal cases always take priority over our actions. As a result, it is difficult to predict the length of time it will take to complete an enforcement action. Moreover, we believe there is a trend in increasing numbers of civil and criminal proceedings and, as a result, we believe that the risk of delays in our patent enforcement actions has grown and will continue to grow and will increasingly affect our business in the future unless this trend changes. Any reductions in the funding of the USPTO could have an adverse impact on the cost of processing pending patent applications and the value of those pending patent applications. Our ownership or acquisition of pending patent applications before the USPTO is subject to funding and other risks applicable to a government agency. The value of our patent portfolio is dependent, in part, on the issuance of patents in a timely manner, and any reductions in the funding of the USPTO could negatively impact the value of our assets. Further, reductions in funding from Congress could result in higher patent application filing and maintenance fees charged by the USPTO, causing an unexpected increase in our expenses. Our acquisitions of patent assets may be time consuming, complex and costly, which could adversely affect our operating results. Acquisitions of patent or other intellectual property assets, are often time consuming, complex and costly to consummate. We may utilize many different transaction structures in our acquisitions and the terms of such acquisition agreements tend to be heavily negotiated. As a result, we expect to incur significant operating expenses and may be required to raise capital during the negotiations even if the acquisition is ultimately not consummated. Even if we are able to acquire particular patent assets, there is no guarantee that we will generate sufficient revenue related to those patent assets to offset the acquisition costs. While we will seek to conduct sufficient due diligence on the patent assets we are considering for acquisition, we may acquire patent assets from a seller who does not have proper title to those assets. In those cases, we may be required to spend significant resources to defend our ownership interest in the patent assets and, if we are not successful, our acquisition may be invalid, in which case we could lose part or all of our investment in the assets. 9Table of Contents We may also identify patent or other patent assets that cost more than we are prepared to spend. We may incur significant costs to organize and negotiate a structured acquisition that does not ultimately result in an acquisition of any patent assets or, if consummated, proves to be unprofitable for us. These higher costs could adversely affect our operating results and, if we incur losses, the value of our securities will decline. In addition, we may acquire patents and technologies that are in the early stages of adoption in the commercial, industrial and consumer markets. Demand for some of these technologies will likely be untested and may be subject to fluctuation based upon the rate at which our companies may adopt our patented technologies in their products and services. As a result, there can be no assurance as to whether technologies we acquire or develop will have value that we can monetize. In certain acquisitions of patent assets, we may seek to defer payment or finance a portion of the acquisition price. This approach may put us at a competitive disadvantage and could result in harm to our business. We have limited capital and may seek to negotiate acquisitions of patent or other intellectual property assets where we can defer payments or finance a portion of the acquisition price. These types of debt financing or deferred payment arrangements may not be as attractive to sellers of patent assets as receiving the full purchase price for those assets in cash at the closing of the acquisition. As a result, we might not compete effectively against other companies in the market for acquiring patent assets, many of whom have substantially greater cash resources than we have. In addition, any failure to satisfy any debt repayment obligations that we may incur, may result in adverse consequences to our operating results. Any failure to maintain or protect our patent assets could significantly impair our return on investment from such assets and harm our brand, our business and our operating results. Our ability to operate our business and compete in the patent market largely depends on the superiority, uniqueness and value of our acquired patent assets.  To protect our proprietary rights, we rely on and will rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements, common interest agreements and agreements with our employees and third parties, and protective contractual provisions. No assurances can be given that any of the measures we undertake to protect and maintain the value of our assets will be successful. Following the acquisition of patent assets, we will likely be required to spend significant time and resources to maintain the effectiveness of such assets by paying maintenance fees and making filings with the USPTO. We may acquire patent assets, including patent applications that require us to spend resources to prosecute such patent applications with the USPTO. Moreover, there is a material risk that patent related claims (such as, for example, infringement claims (and/or claims for indemnification resulting therefrom), unenforceability claims or invalidity claims) will be asserted or prosecuted against us, and such assertions or prosecutions could materially and adversely affect our business. Regardless of whether any such claims are valid or can be successfully asserted, defending such claims could cause us to incur significant costs and could divert resources away from our core business activities. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, any of the following or similar occurrences may reduce the value of our intellectual property: ·                  our patent applications, trademarks and copyrights may not be granted and, if granted, may be challenged or invalidated;·                  issued trademarks, copyrights, or patents may not provide us with any competitive advantages when compared to potentially infringing other properties;·                  our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights may not be effective in preventing misappropriation of our technology; or·                  our efforts may not prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to or competitive with, or superior to those we acquire and/or prosecute. Moreover, we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in certain foreign countries where we may do business in the future or from which competitors may operate. If we fail to maintain, defend or prosecute our patent assets properly, the value of those assets would be reduced or eliminated, and our business would be harmed. 10Table of Contents Weak global economic conditions may cause infringing parties to delay entering into settlement and licensing agreements, which could prolong our litigation and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Our business depends significantly on worldwide economic conditions, and the United States and world economies have recently experienced weak economic conditions. Uncertainty about global economic conditions poses a risk as businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news and declines in income or asset values. This response could have a material adverse effect on the willingness of parties infringing on our assets to enter into settlements or other revenue generating agreements voluntarily. Entering into such agreements is critical to our business and our failure to do so could cause material harm to our business. If we are unable to adequately protect our patent assets, we may not be able to compete effectively. Our ability to compete depends in part upon the strength of the patents and patent rights that we own or may hereafter acquire. We rely on a combination of U.S. and foreign patents, copyrights, trademark, trade secret laws and other types of agreements to establish and protect our patent, intellectual property and proprietary rights. The efforts we take to protect our patents, intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective at stopping unauthorized use of our patents, intellectual property and proprietary rights. In addition, effective trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available or cost-effective in every country in which our services are made available. There may be instances where we are not able to fully protect or utilize our patent and other intellectual property in a manner that maximizes competitive advantage. If we are unable to protect our patent assets and intellectual property and proprietary rights from unauthorized use, the value of those assets may be reduced, which could negatively impact our business. Our inability to obtain appropriate protections for our intellectual property may also allow competitors to enter markets and produce or sell the same or similar products. In addition, protecting our patents and patent rights is expensive and diverts critical managerial resources. If any of the foregoing were to occur, or if we are otherwise unable to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. If we are forced to resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights, the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive. In addition, our patent rights could be at risk if we are unsuccessful in, or cannot afford to pursue, those proceedings. We also rely on trade secrets and contract law to protect some of our patent rights and proprietary technology. We will enter into confidentiality and invention agreements with our employees and consultants. Nevertheless, these agreements may not be honored and they may not effectively protect our right to our un-patented trade secrets and know-how. Moreover, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and know-how. We expect that we will be substantially dependent on a concentrated number of customers. If we are unable to establish, maintain or replace our relationships with customers and develop a diversified customer base, our revenues may fluctuate and our growth may be limited. A significant portion of our revenues will be generated from a limited number of customers and licenses to such customers. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the five largest licenses accounted for approximately 97% of our total revenue. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to obtain additional licenses for the Companys patents, or if we are able to generate additional licenses, that those licenses will be of the same or larger size allowing us to sustain or grow our revenue levels, respectively. If we are not able to generate licenses from the limited group of prospective customers that we anticipate may generate a substantial majority of our revenues in the future, or if they do not generate revenues at the levels or at the times that we anticipate, our ability to maintain or grow our revenues and our results of operations will be adversely affected. We acquired the rights to market and license a patent analytics tool from IP Navigation Group, LLC and will dedicate resources and incur costs in an effort to generate revenues.  We may not be able to generate revenues and there is a risk that the time spent marketing and licensing the tool will distract management from the enforcement of the Companys patent portfolios. We expect to dedicate resources and incur costs in the marketing and licensing of Opus Analytics, the patent analytics tool, in order to generate revenue, but there are no assurances that our efforts will be successful.  We may not generate any revenues from the licensing of Opus Analytics or may not generate enough license revenue to exceed our costs.  Our efforts therefore could lead to losses and could have a material adverse effect on our income, expenses or results of operations. In addition, the time and effort spent marketing and licensing Opus Analytics could distract the Company and its officers from the management of the balance of the Companys business and have a deleterious effect on results from the enforcement of the Companys patents and patent rights.  This could lead to either sub-par returns from the patent and patent right enforcement efforts or even total losses of the value of such patents and patent rights, leading to considerable losses. 11Table of Contents The Company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to which could increase the Companys costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the Companys business. The Company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas. These U.S. and foreign laws and regulations affect the Companys activities and compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation, could individually or in the aggregate impact the Companys revenue, margins and profits or cause the Company to change or limit its business practices. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Companys employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Companys policies and procedures. The Companys business is subject to the risks of international operations. The Company derives an increasing portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations. Compliance with applicable U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, such as anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, environmental laws, labor laws and anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations, a violation by the Companys employees, contractors, or agents could nevertheless occur. The Company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including, but not limited to, economic and labor conditions, foreign exchange fluctuations, increased duties, taxes and other costs and political instability. The Company is subject to the risk of certain fees and penalties. Under certain circumstances, the Company would be subject to the payment of fees and penalties in the event that it was to lose an enforcement action, with the fees and penalties payable either or both to the defendants or the courts.  While the Company endeavors to avoid such fees and penalties with high level of diligence of new enforcement actions, there can be no guarantee that the Company may lose one or more enforcement campaigns and be subject to such penalties or fees. In order to satisfy a judgment against defendants, the Company may be required to post a bond and there is no certainty that the Company will have the resources do so. In certain jurisdictions, the Company would be required to post a bond in order to effectuate a judgement against one or more defendants.  There is no certainty that the Company will have the resources to do so, which would put at risk the judgment against the defendants and cost the Company to be unable to affect its case. Risks Related to Our Indebtedness Our cash flows and capital resources may be insufficient to make required payments on our indebtedness and future indebtedness. As of December 31, 2016, we have $17,832,509 of indebtedness outstanding, net of discounts. Our indebtedness could have important consequences to our shareholders. For example, it could: ·                make it difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations;·                make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;·                limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements;·                expose us to interest rate fluctuations because the interest rate on the debt under our existing credit facility is variable;·                  require us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for operations and other purposes;·                limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and·                  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that may have proportionately less debt and greater financial resources. In addition, our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations depends on our successful financial and operating performance, cash flows and capital resources, which in turn depend upon prevailing economic conditions and certain financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among others: ·          economic and demand factors affecting our industry;·          pricing pressures;·          increased operating costs;·          competitive conditions; and·          other operating difficulties. 12Table of Contents If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt. In the event that we are required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations, the value realized on such assets or operations will depend on market conditions and the availability of buyers. Accordingly, any such sale may not, among other things, be for a sufficient dollar amount. Our obligations pursuant to our loan agreement with Fortress (as defined below) are secured by a security interest in all of our assets, exclusive of intellectual property. The foregoing encumbrances may limit our ability to dispose of material assets or operations. We also may not be able to restructure our indebtedness on favorable economic terms, if at all. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including pursuant to the Fortress Documents (as defined herein). Our incurrence of additional indebtedness would intensify the risks described above. The Fortress Documents contain various covenants limiting the discretion of our management in operating our business. On January 29, 2015, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a series of agreements including a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Fortress Purchase Agreement) and a Subscription Agreement with DBD Credit Funding, LLC (DBD), an affiliate of Fortress Credit Corp., pursuant to which the Company sold to the purchasers: (i) $15,000,000 original principal amount of Senior Secured Notes (the Fortress Notes), (ii) a right to receive a portion of certain proceeds from monetization net revenues received by the Company (after receipt by the Company of $15,000,000 of monetization net revenues and repayment of the Fortress Notes), (iii) a five-year warrant (the Fortress Warrant) to purchase 100,000 shares of the Companys Common Stock exercisable at $7.44 per share, subject to adjustment; and (iv) 134,409 shares of the Companys Common Stock.  Pursuant to the Fortress Purchase Agreement, as security for the payment and performance in full of the secured obligations, the Company and certain subsidiaries executed and delivered in favor of the purchasers a Security Agreement and a Patent Security Agreement, including a pledge of the Companys interests in certain of its subsidiaries (together with the Fortress Purchase Agreement, the Fortress Notes and the Fortress Warrant, the Fortress Documents).  On February 12, 2015, the Company exercised its right to require the purchasers to purchase an additional $5,000,000 of Notes from the Company. On January 10, 2017, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries (each a Subsidiary and collectively with the Issuer, the Company) entered into an amended and restated revenue sharing and securities purchase agreement (the ARRSSPA) with DBD, an affiliate of Fortress Credit Corp. (Fortress), under which the Company and DBD amended and restated the Revenue Sharing and Securities Purchase Agreement dated January 29, 2015 (the Original Agreement) pursuant to which (i) Fortress purchased $20,000,000 in promissory notes, (ii) an interest in the Companys revenues from certain activities and (iii) warrants to purchase 100,000 shares of the Companys common stock.  As of the close of the restructuring on January 10, 2017, there was $20,131,158 in outstanding principal and PIK interest accrued. The Fortress Documents contain, subject to certain carve-outs, various restrictive covenants that limit our managements discretion in operating our business. In particular, these instruments limit our ability to, among other things: ·          incur additional debt;·          grant liens on assets;·          dispose assets outside the ordinary course of business; and·          make fundamental business changes. If we fail to comply with the restrictions in the Fortress Documents, a default may allow the creditors under the relevant instruments to accelerate the related debt and to exercise their remedies under these agreements, which will typically include the right to declare the principal amount of that debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other related amounts, immediately due and payable, to exercise any remedies the creditors may have to foreclose on assets that are subject to liens securing that debt and to terminate any commitments they had made to supply further funds. The rights of the holders of the Companys Common Stock will be subordinate to our creditors. On October 16, 2014, we issued convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of $5,550,000, which mature on October 16, 2018, of which, $500,000 remains outstanding as of December 31, 2016. On January 29, 2015 and February 12, 2015, we issued to DBD notes in the principal amounts of $15,000,000 and $5,000,000, respectively, and on January 10, 2017, we entered into an amendment of the agreement with DBD whereby we restructured the principal amortization scheduled. At the close of the restructuring, the outstanding principal and accrued PIK interest under the mended and restated revenue sharing and securities purchase agreement (the ARRSSPA) was $20,131,158. 13Table of Contents Accordingly, the holders of Common Stock will rank junior to such indebtedness, as well as to other non-equity claims on the Company and our assets, including claims upon liquidation. Risks Relating to Our Stock Our management will be able to exert significant influence over us to the detriment of minority stockholders. Our executive officers and directors beneficially own approximately 25.8% of our outstanding Common Stock as of March 15, 2017. As a result, our management could exert significant influence over our business and affairs and all matters requiring stockholder approval, including mergers or other fundamental corporate transactions. The concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and could affect the market price of our Common Stock. Exercise of warrants will dilute stockholders percentage of ownership. We have issued options and warrants to purchase shares of our Common Stock to our officers, directors, consultants and certain shareholders.  In the future, we may grant additional options, warrants and convertible securities. The exercise or conversion of options, warrants or convertible securities will dilute the percentage ownership of our stockholders. The dilutive effect of the exercise or conversion of these securities may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional capital. The holders of these securities may be expected to exercise or convert such options, warrants and convertible securities at a time when we would be able to obtain additional equity capital on terms more favorable than such securities or when our common stock is trading at a price higher than the exercise or conversion price of the securities. The exercise or conversion of outstanding warrants, options and convertible securities will have a dilutive effect on the securities held by our stockholders. Our Common Stock may be delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market (NASDAQ) if we fail to comply with continued listing standards. Our Common Stock is currently traded on NASDAQ under the symbol MARA.  If we fail to meet any of the continued listing standards of NASDAQ, our Common Stock could be delisted from NASDAQ.  These continued listing standards include specifically enumerated criteria, such as: ·                  a $1.00 minimum closing bid price;·                  stockholders equity of $2.5 million;·                  500,000 shares of publicly-held Common Stock with a market value of at least $1 million;·                  300 round-lot stockholders; and·                  compliance with NASDAQs corporate governance requirements, as well as additional or more stringent criteria that may be applied in the exercise of NASDAQs discretionary authority. We could fail in future financing efforts or be delisted from NASDAQ if we fail to receive stockholder approval when required. Under the NASDAQ rules, we are required to obtain stockholder approval for any issuance of additional equity securities that would comprise 20% or more of the total shares of our Common Stock outstanding before the issuance of such securities sold at a discount to the greater of book or market value in an offering that is not deemed to be a public offering by NASDAQ.  Funding of our operations and acquisitions of assets may require issuance of additional equity securities at a discount that would comprise 20% or more of the total shares of our Common Stock outstanding, but we might not be successful in obtaining the required stockholder approval for such an issuance.  If we are unable to obtain financing due to stockholder approval difficulties, such failure may have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations. Our Common Stock may be affected by limited trading volume and price fluctuations, which could adversely impact the value of our Common Stock. There has been limited trading in our Common Stock and there can be no assurance that an active trading market in our Common Stock will either develop or be maintained. Our Common Stock has experienced, and is likely to experience in the future, significant price and volume fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock without regard to our operating performance. In addition, we believe that factors such as quarterly fluctuations in our financial results and changes in the overall economy or the condition of the financial markets could cause the price of our Common Stock to fluctuate substantially. These fluctuations may also cause short sellers to periodically enter the market in the belief that we will have poor results in the future. We cannot predict the actions of market participants and, therefore, can offer no assurances that the market for our common stock will be stable or appreciate over time. 14Table of Contents Holders of the Companys Common Stock will experience immediate and substantial dilution upon the conversion of the Companys outstanding preferred stock, convertible note and the exercise of the Companys outstanding options and warrants including the warrants for which the underlying shares are being registered herein. As of December 31, 2016: ·                  3,516,136 shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options having a weighted average exercise price of $4.46 per share;·                  466,078 shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants with a weighted average exercise price of $3.79;·                  782,004 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of 782,004 outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock; and·                  66,667 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of $500,000 in outstanding convertible notes. Assuming full conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock and the convertible notes and exercise of all outstanding options and warrants, the number of shares of our Common Stock outstanding will increase 4,830,885 shares from 19,302,472 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of March 15, 2017 to 24,133,357 shares of Common Stock outstanding. Our stock price may be volatile. The market price of our Common Stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following: ·                  changes in our industry;·                  competitive pricing pressures;·                  our ability to obtain working capital financing;·                  additions or departures of key personnel;·                  sales of our Common Stock;·                  our ability to execute our business plan;·                  operating results that fall below expectations;·                  loss of any strategic relationship;·                  regulatory developments; and·                  economic and other external factors. In addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock. We have never paid nor do we expect in the near future to pay cash dividends. On November 19, 2014, we declared a stock dividend pursuant to which holders of our common stock as of the close of business on December 15, 2014 received one additional share of Common Stock for each share of common stock held by such holders. Other than as described herein, we have never paid cash dividends on our capital stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Common Stock for the foreseeable future.  While it is possible that we may declare a dividend after a large settlement, investors should not rely on such a possibility, nor should they rely on an investment in us if they require income generated from dividends paid on our capital stock.  Any income derived from our Common Stock would only come from rise in the market price of our Common Stock, which is uncertain and unpredictable. Offers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock may cause the price of our Common Stock to decline. If our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our Common Stock in the public market upon the expiration of any statutory holding period or lockup agreements, under Rule 144, or issued upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or other convertible securities, it could create a circumstance commonly referred to as an overhang and in anticipation of which the market price of our Common Stock could fall.  The existence of an overhang, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could make more difficult our ability to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.  The shares of our restricted Common Stock will be freely tradable upon the earlier of: (i) effectiveness of a registration statement covering such shares and (ii) the date on which such shares may be sold without registration pursuant to Rule 144 (or other applicable exemption) under the Securities Act. 15Table of Contents Because we became a public company by means of a reverse merger, we may not be able to attract the attention of major brokerage firms. There may be risks associated with us because we became a public company through a reverse merger. Securities analysts of major brokerage firms may not provide coverage of us since there is no incentive to brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our Common Stock.  No assurance can be given that brokerage firms will, in the future, want to conduct any secondary offerings on our behalf. Investor relations activities, nominal float and supply and demand factors may affect the price of our stock. We expect to utilize various techniques such as non-deal road shows and investor relations campaigns in order to generate investor awareness.  These campaigns may include personal, video and telephone conferences with investors and prospective investors in which our business practices are described.  We may provide compensation to investor relations firms and pay for newsletters, websites, mailings and email campaigns that are produced by third parties based upon publicly-available information concerning us. We do not intend to review or approve the content of such analysts reports or other materials based upon analysts own research or methods.  Investor relations firms should generally disclose when they are compensated for their efforts, but whether such disclosure is made or complete is not under our control. In addition, investors  may, from time to time, also take steps to encourage investor awareness through similar activities that may be undertaken at the expense of the investors.  Investor awareness activities may also be suspended or discontinued which may impact the trading market our Common Stock. If we lose key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully manage our business and achieve our objectives. We believe our future success will depend upon our ability to retain our key management, including Doug Croxall, our Chief Executive Officer. The loss of Mr. Croxall or any other key members of management would have a material adverse effect on our operations.  We have entered into an amendment to the employment agreement with Mr. Croxall, which extends the term of his employment agreement to November 2017.  In addition, Erich Spangenberg, the founder and former Chief Executive Officer and principal of IP Nav and a significant stockholder of the Company, is also important to the success of our Company.  We do not have any agreement with Mr. Spangenberg related to services he is to perform for IP Nav or the Company. We may not be successful in attracting, assimilating and retaining our employees in the future.  We are competing for employees against companies that are more established than we are and that have the ability to pay more cash compensation than we do.  As of the date hereof, we have not experienced problems hiring employees. If we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of internal control, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately and timely or to prevent fraud. Any inability to report and file our financial results accurately and timely could harm our reputation and adversely impact the trading price of our Common Stock. Effective internal control is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, we may not be able to manage our business as effectively as we would if an effective control environment existed, and our business and reputation with investors may be harmed. As a result, our small size and any future internal control deficiencies may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operation and access to capital. We have not performed an in-depth analysis to determine if historical un-discovered failures of internal controls exist, and may in the future discover areas of our internal control that need improvement. As a result of its internal control assessment, the Company determined there is a material weakness with respect to the financial reporting and closing process from lack of segregation of duties and evidence of control review. The Company determined that there is a material weakness in its internal controls with respect to the financial reporting and closing process, resulting from a lack of segregation of duties and evidence of control review.  Since the Company (not including its subsidiary 3D Nano) has ten employees, most of whom have no involvement in our financial controls and reporting, we are unable to sufficiently distribute reporting and accounting to tasks across enough individuals to ensure that the Company does not have a material weakness in its financial reporting system. "

Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as “expects,” “plans,” “will,” “forecasts,” “projects,” “intends,” “estimates,” and other words of similar meaning. One can identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements are likely to address our growth strategy, financial results and product and development programs. One must carefully consider any such statement and should understand that many factors could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements. These factors may include inaccurate assumptions and a broad variety of other risks and uncertainties, including some that are known and some that are not. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual future results may vary materially.     These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the risks in the section entitled “Risk Factors
” and the risks set out below, any of which may cause our or our industry’s actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks include, by way of example and not in limitation: •The uncertainty of profitability;•Risks related to failure to obtain adequate financing on a timely basis and on acceptable terms; and•Other risks and uncertainties related to our business plan and business strategy. This list is not an exhaustive list of the factors that may affect any of our forward-looking statements. These and other factors should be considered carefully and readers should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Forward looking statements are made based on management’s beliefs, estimates and opinions on the date the statements are made and we undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements if these beliefs, estimates and opinions or other circumstances should change. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.     Information regarding market and industry statistics contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is included based on information available to us that we believe is accurate. It is generally based on industry and other publications that are not produced for purposes of securities offerings or economic analysis. We have not reviewed or included data from all sources. Forecasts and other forward-looking information obtained from these sources are subject to the same qualifications and the additional uncertainties accompanying any estimates of future market size, revenue and market acceptance of products and services. As a result, investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.     As used in this annual report, the terms “we”, “us”, “our”, the “Company”, “Marathon Patent Group, Inc.” and “MARA” mean Marathon Patent Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated.   -1-Table of ContentsPART IITEM 1. BUSINESS     We acquire patents and patent rights from owners or other ventures and seek to monetize the value of the patents through litigation and licensing strategies, alone or with others.    Part of our acquisition strategy is to acquire or invest in patents and patent rights that cover a wide-range of subject matter which allows us to seek the benefits of a diversified portfolio of assets in differing industries and countries.  Generally, the patents and patent rights that we seek to acquire have large identifiable targets who are or have been using technology that we believe infringes our patents and patent rights.  We generally monetize our portfolio of patents and patent rights by entering into license discussions, and if that is unsuccessful, initiating enforcement activities against any infringing parties with the objective of entering into comprehensive settlement and license agreements that may include the granting of non-exclusive retroactive and future rights to use the patented technology, a covenant not to sue, a release of the party from certain claims, the dismissal of any pending litigation and other terms.  Our strategy has been developed with the expectation that it will result in a long-term, diversified revenue stream for the Company. As of December 31, 2014, we owned 378 U.S. and foreign patents and patent rights and 22 patent applications.      Our principal office is located at 11100 Santa Monica Blvd., Suite 380, Los Angeles, CA 90225. Our telephone number is (703) 232-1701.     We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 23, 2010 under the name “Verve Ventures, Inc.” On December 7, 2011, we changed our name to “American Strategic Minerals Corporation” and were engaged in exploration and potential development of uranium and vanadium minerals business. During June 2012, we discontinued our minerals business and began to invest in real estate properties in Southern California. In November 2012, we discontinued our real estate business.  Industry Overview and Market Opportunity     Under U.S. law, an inventor or patent owner has the right to seek to exclude others from making, selling or using their patented invention and seeking damages. Unfortunately, it is often the case that infringers are unwilling, at least initially, to negotiate or pay reasonable royalties for their unauthorized use of patents and some prefer to fight allegations of patent infringement. Inventors and/or patent holders, without sufficient legal, financial and/or expert technical resources to commence or continue legal action, are at a disadvantage as they may be perceived to lack credibility in dealing with potential licensees and as a result, are often ignored. As a result of the common reluctance of patent infringers to negotiate and ultimately take a patent license for the use of patented technologies, patent licensing and enforcement often begins with the filing of patent enforcement litigation. However, the majority of patent infringement litigations settle out of court based on the strength of the patent claims, validity, and persuasive evidence and clarity that the patent is being infringed.Business Model and Strategy – Overview     Our business encompasses two main elements: (1) the identification, analysis and acquisition of patents and patent rights; and (2) the generation of revenue from the acquired patents or patent rights.  Typically, we compensate the patent seller with cash, equity, earn-out or debt upon the acquisition of the patents or patent rights or resolution of claims.  Key Factors of Our Business ModelDiversification     As of December 31, 2014, we owned 378 U.S. and foreign patents and patent rights and 22 patent applications across a broad array of technologies and markets.  We intend to add more patents and patent applications for the purpose of generating additional revenues from assertion against infringers.  By owning multiple patent assets, we seek to continue to be diversified in both the types of patents that we own as well as the frequency and size of the monetization revenue generated.  This diversification prevents us from having to rely on a single patent, or patent family, to generate our revenue. Additionally, by commencing multiple settlement and licensing campaigns with our different patent assets, we intend to generate frequent revenue events through the execution of multiple settlement and licensing agreements.  Our diversification of patent assets and revenue generation allows us to avoid the binary risk that can be associated with owning a single patent asset that typically generates a single stream of licensing revenue.   -2-Table of ContentsPatent Acquisition Opportunities     We have worked to establish a supply of patent acquisition opportunities with patent brokers and dealers, with individual inventors and patent owners, as well as with large corporations (including Fortune 500 corporations) who own patents.  Service providers, such as patent prosecution and litigation attorneys and patent licensing professionals, have also become key providers of patent opportunities.  We maintain an important relationship with IP Navigation Group LLC (“IP Nav”), and have received a significant amount of our patent acquisition opportunities from our relationship with IP Nav.  Affiliates of IP Nav maintain a significant ownership interest in our Company, as well as participating with us in revenue from various asset monetization efforts.  We intend to continue to expand our relationships for patent acquisitions, and expand the industries to which our patents apply. Patent Portfolio Evaluation     We follow a disciplined due diligence approach when analyzing potential patent acquisitions.  Each opportunity to acquire a patent can vary based on the amount and type of patent assets, the complexity of the underlying inventions, and the analysis of the industries in which the invention is being used.Opus Analytics     During September 2014 we acquired a limited field of use exclusive license to market Opus Analytics from IP Nav.  Opus Analytics is a proprietary patent analytics tool that we use extensively to review and analyze patent acquisition opportunities.  Opus Analytics is also a SAAS (Software as a Service) tool that we offer to third-parties to generate additional revenue streams from financial professionals, investors, patent licensing and monetization companies, and legal and investment professionals.     Our potential patent acquisition opportunities are entered into Opus Analytics to evaluate patent decisions.  The algorithm underlying Opus is comprised of approximately 120 factors, and it has been continuously updated using actual observations.  After evaluation of the patents by Opus Analytics, the Company reviews subtleties in the language of a patent’s recorded interactions with the patent office and evaluates prior art and literature. This evaluation can make significant differences in the potential monetization revenue derived from a patent or patent portfolio. We have developed proprietary processes and procedures for identifying problem areas and evaluating the strength of a patent portfolio before the decision is made to allocate resources to an acquisition or to launch an effective monetization effort, using the judgment and skill of our personnel.     We may also seek to use third-party experts in the evaluation and due diligence of patent assets.  The combination of our management team and third-party patent attorneys, intellectual property licensing experts, and technology engineers allow us to conduct our tailored patent acquisition and evaluation processes and procedures.   We evaluate both the types and strength of the claims of the patent as well as the file history of the patent.     Finally, we identify potential infringers; industries within which the potential infringers exist; longevity of the patented technology; and a variety of other factors that directly impact the magnitude and potential success of a licensing and enforcement program. Competition     While there has been a noticeable proliferation of patent monetization firms seeking to enter the business in the past few years, both public and private, there also has emerged competition from aggregators and commercial enterprises seeking to extend non-litigation licensing or membership approaches to patent disputes, which is a further source of competition to our business.   We also compete with venture capital enterprises and funds, strategic buyers, lawyers and various industry leaders for patents and patent rights.  There also is strong competition for experts, engineers and attorneys who are important for successful monetization campaigns when litigation ensues.  Most of these competitors have substantially greater financial and human resources than we do.  As the market matures, we expect more companies entering the market to pursue similar opportunities, which may reduce our market share and opportunities.   -3-Table of ContentsOur Customers     Currently, we define customers as those companies that procure licenses to our patents, to satisfy legal claims of infringement against commercial products or services they produce or sell. Our licensees generally obtain non-recurring, non-exclusive, non-assignable license agreements in return for a single payment at signing.  However, in certain cases, such as the licenses for our Medtech portfolio, we may enter into licenses with recurring royalty payments that continue for a defined period of time. Intellectual Property and Patent Rights     Our intellectual property is primarily comprised of issued patents, patent applications and contract rights to patents.  We began to generate revenue from patents during the second quarter of 2013.  As of December 31, 2014, the median expiration date for patents in our portfolio is August 6, 2017, and the latest expiration date for a patent in our portfolio is July 29, 2029.  A summary of our patent portfolios is as follows: SubsidiaryNumber of PatentsEarliest Expiration Date Median Expiration DateLatest Expiration DateSubject MatterBismarck IP Inc.1409/15/1609/15/1501/22/18Communication and PBX equipmentClouding Corp.70Expired10/05/2103/29/29Network and data managementCRFD Research, Inc.409/17/2108/11/2208/19/23Web page content translator and device-to-device transfer systemCyberfone Systems, LLC38Expired09/15/1511/11/17Telephony and data transactionsDynamic Advances, LLC4Expired10/02/1703/06/23Natural language interfaceE2E Processing, Inc.404/27/2011/17/2307/18/24Manufacturing schedules using adaptive learningHybrid Sequence IP, Inc.211/14/1509/09/1607/17/17Asynchronous communicationsIP Liquidity Ventures, LLC6Expired06/06/1507/26/20Pharmaceuticals / tire pressure systemsLoopback Technologies, Inc.10Expired09/25/1708/27/22AutomotiveMedtech Group Acquisition Corp.169Expired06/01/1807/29/29Medical technologyRelay IP, Inc.1ExpiredExpiredExpiredMulticastingSampo IP, LLC303/13/1803/13/1811/16/23Centrifugal communicationsSarif Biomedical LLC5ExpiredExpiredExpiredMicrosurgery equipmentSelene Communication Technologies, LLC305/05/1811/23/2011/28/21CommunicationsSignal IP, Inc.703/10/1412/01/1508/06/22AutomotiveTLI Communications, LLC106/17/1706/17/1706/17/17TelecommunicationsVantage Point Technology, Inc.37Expired12/21/1603/09/18Computer networking and operations   -4-Table of Contents Patent Enforcement Litigation     We are involved in numerous ongoing patent enforcement proceedings alleging infringement in numerous jurisdictions, both within the United States and abroad.  As of December 31, 2014, we were involved in enforcement actions against approximately 77 defendants, as set forth below: United States  District of Delaware 25 Eastern District of Texas 18 Central District of California 12 Northern District of California 8 Eastern District of Michigan 2 Northern District of New York 1    Foreign  Germany 11  Research and Development     We have not expended funds for research and development costs.Employees     As of December 31, 2014, we had 8 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee.   We believe our employee relations to be good.ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSThere are numerous and varied risks, known and unknown, that may prevent us from achieving our goals. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operation may be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment.Risks Related to Our CompanyWe have changed the focus of our business to acquiring patents and patent rights and monetizing the value of those assets through enforcement campaigns that are expected to generate revenue.  We may not be able to successfully monetize the patents that we acquire and thus we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions.There is no assurance that we will be able to continue to successfully acquire, develop or monetize our patent portfolio. The acquisition of patents could fail to produce anticipated benefits or we could have other adverse effects that we do not currently foresee. Failure to successfully monetize our patents would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   -5-Table of Contents     In addition, the acquisition of patent portfolios is subject to a number of risks, including, but not limited to the following:●There is a significant time lag between acquiring a patent portfolio and recognizing revenue from those patent assets. During that time lag, substantial amounts of costs are likely to be incurred that could have a negative effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position;●The monetization of a patent portfolio will be a time consuming and expensive process that may disrupt our operations. If our monetization efforts are not successful, our results of operations could be harmed. In addition, we may not achieve anticipated synergies or other benefits from such acquisition; and●We may encounter unforeseen difficulties with our business or operations in the future that may deplete our capital resources more rapidly than anticipated. As a result, we may be required to obtain additional working capital in the future through public or private debt or equity financings, borrowings or otherwise. If we are required to raise additional working capital in the future, such financing may be unavailable to us on favorable terms, if at all, or may be dilutive to our existing stockholders. If we fail to obtain additional working capital, as and when needed, such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.     Therefore, there is no assurance that the monetization of our patent portfolios will generate enough revenue to recoup our investment.We are presently reliant on the patent assets we acquire from other patent owners. If we are unable to monetize such assets and generate revenue and profit through those assets or by other means, there is a significant risk that our business would fail.     At the commencement of our current line of business in 2012, we acquired a portfolio of patent assets from Sampo IP, LLC (“Sampo”), a company affiliated with our Chief Executive Officer, Douglas Croxall, from which we have generated revenue from enforcement activities and for which we plan to continue to generate enforcement related revenue.  On April 16, 2013, we acquired a patent from Mosaid Technologies Incorporated, a Canadian corporation. On April 22, 2013, we acquired a patent portfolio through a merger between CyberFone Acquisition Corp., a Texas corporation and our wholly owned subsidiary and CyberFone Systems LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“CyberFone Systems”). In June 2013, in connection with the closing of a licensing agreement with Siemens Technology, we acquired a patent portfolio from that company.  In September 2013, we acquired a portfolio from TeleCommunication Systems and an additional portfolio from Intergraph Corporation.  In October 2013, we acquired a patent portfolio from TT IP, LLC.  In December 2013 we had three transactions: (i) in connection with a licensing agreement with Zhone, we acquired a portfolio of patents from that company; (ii) we acquired a patent portfolio from Delphi Technologies, Inc.; and (iii) in connection with a settlement and license agreement, we agreed to settle and release another defendant for past and future use of our patents, whereby the defendant agreed to assign and transfer 2 U.S. patents and rights to us.  In May 2014, we acquired ownership rights of Dynamic Advances, LLC, a Texas limited liability company, IP Liquidity Ventures, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and Sarif Biomedical, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, all of which hold patent portfolios or contract rights to the revenue generated from the patent portfolios. In June 2014, we acquired Selene Communication Technologies, LLC, which holds multiple patents in the search and network intrusion field. In August 2014, we acquired patents from Clouding IP LLC, with such patents related to network and data management technology.  In September 2014, we acquired TLI Communications, which owns a single patent in the telecommunication field.  In October 2014, we acquired three patent portfolios from MedTech Development, LLC, which owns medical technology patents. We plan to generate revenues from our acquired patent portfolios.  However, if our efforts to generate revenue from these assets fail, we will have incurred significant losses and may be unable to acquire additional assets. If this occurs, our business would likely fail.    -6-Table of Contents  We have economic interests in portfolios that the Company does not control and the decision regarding the timing and amount of licenses are held by third parties, which could lead to outcomes materially different than what the Company intended.    The Company owns contract rights to two portfolios over which it does not exercise control and cannot determine when and if, and if so, for how much, the patent owner licenses the patents.  This could lead to situations where we have dedicated resources, time and money to portfolios that despite the best interests of the Company provide little or no return on our investment.  In these situations, the Company would record a loss on its investment and incur losses that contribute to the overall performance of the company.Failure to effectively manage our growth could place strains on our managerial, operational and financial resources and could adversely affect our business and operating results.     Our growth has placed, and is expected to continue to place, a strain on our managerial, operational and financial resources and systems which are limited. Further, as our subsidiary companies’ businesses grow, we will be required to continue to manage multiple relationships. Any further growth by us or our subsidiary companies, or an increase in the number of our strategic relationships, may place additional strain on our managerial, operational and financial resources and systems. Although we may not grow as we expect, if we fail to manage our growth effectively or to develop and expand our managerial, operational and financial resources and systems, our business and financial results would be materially harmed. We initiate legal proceedings against potentially infringing companies in the normal course of our business and we believe that extended litigation proceedings would be time-consuming and costly, which may adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to operate our business.     To monetize our patent assets, we generally initiate legal proceedings against likely infringing companies, pursuant to which we may allege that such companies infringe on one or more of our patents. Our viability could be highly dependent on the outcome of the litigation, and there is a risk that we may be unable to achieve the results we desire from such litigation, which failure would substantially harm our business.  In addition, the defendants in the litigations are likely to be much larger than us and have substantially more resources than we do, which could make our litigation efforts more difficult and impact the duration of the litigation which would require us to devote our limited financial, managerial and other resources to support litigation that may be disproportionate to the anticipated recovery.     We anticipate that these legal proceedings may continue for several years and may require significant expenditures for legal fees and other expenses. Disputes regarding the assertion of patents and other intellectual property rights are highly complex and technical. Once initiated, we may be forced to litigate against others to enforce or defend our patent rights or to determine the validity and scope of other party’s patent rights. The defendants or other third parties involved in the lawsuits in which we are involved may allege defenses and/or file counterclaims or commence re-examination proceedings by patenting issuance authorities in an effort to avoid or limit liability and damages for patent infringement, or declare our patents to be invalid or non-infringed. If such defenses or counterclaims are successful, they may preclude our ability to derive monetization revenue from the patents. A negative outcome of any such litigation, or affecting one or more claims contained within any such litigation, could materially and adversely impact our business. Additionally, we anticipate that our legal fees and other expenses will be material and will negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations and may result in our inability to continue our business.We may seek to internally develop additional new inventions and intellectual property, which would take time and be costly. Moreover, the failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights for such inventions would lead to the loss of our investments in such activities.     We may in the future seek to engage in commercial business ventures or seek internal development of new inventions or intellectual property.  These activities would require significant amounts of financial, managerial and other resources and would take time to achieve. Such activities could also distract our management team from its present business initiatives, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business. There is also the risk that such initiatives may not yield any viable new business or revenue, inventions or technology, which would lead to a loss of our investment in such activities.   -7-Table of Contents     In addition, even if we are able to internally develop new inventions, in order for those inventions to be viable and to compete effectively, we would need to develop and maintain, and we would be heavily reliant upon, a proprietary position with respect to such inventions and intellectual property. However, there are significant risks associated with any such intellectual property we may develop principally including the following:  ●patent applications we may file may not result in issued patents or may take longer than we expect to result in issued patents;    ●we may be subject to interference proceedings;    ●we may be subject to opposition proceedings in the U.S. or foreign countries;    ●any patents that are issued to us may not provide meaningful protection;    ●we may not be able to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;    ●other companies may challenge patents issued to us;    ●other companies may have independently developed and/or patented (or may in the future independently develop and patent) similar or alternative technologies, or duplicate our technologies;    ●other companies may design around technologies we have developed; and    ●enforcement of our patents would be complex, uncertain and very expensive.     We cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any future patent applications, or that any of our patents, once issued, will provide us with adequate protection from competing products. For example, issued patents may be circumvented or challenged, declared invalid or unenforceable, or narrowed in scope. In addition, since publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we will be the first to make our additional new inventions or to file patent applications covering those inventions. It is also possible that others may have or may obtain issued patents that could prevent us from commercializing our products or require us to obtain licenses requiring the payment of significant fees or royalties in order to enable us to conduct our business. As to those patents that we may acquire, our continued rights will depend on meeting any obligations to the seller and we may be unable to do so. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights for our inventions would lead to the loss of our investments in such activities, which would have a material adverse effect on us.     Moreover, patent application delays could cause delays in recognizing revenue from our internally generated patents and could cause us to miss opportunities to license patents before other competing technologies are developed or introduced into the market.Our future success depends on our ability to expand our organization to match the growth of our activities.     As our operations grow, the administrative demands upon us will grow, and our success will depend upon our ability to meet those demands. We are organized as a holding company, with numerous subsidiaries, each of which will require their own needs for financial, managerial and other resources to be satisfied, and the parent operating company will have its own requirements for financial, managerial and other resources, which could create challenges to our ability to successfully manage our subsidiaries and operations and which could impact our ability to assure compliance with our policies, practices and procedures. These demands include increased executive, accounting, management, legal services, staff support, and general office services. We may need to hire additional qualified personnel to meet these demands, the cost and quality of which is dependent in part upon market factors outside of our control. Further, we will need to effectively manage the training and growth of our staff to maintain an efficient and effective workforce, and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business and operating results.   -8-Table of Contents Potential acquisitions may present risks, and we may be unable to achieve the financial or other goals intended at the time of any potential acquisition.     Our future growth depends, in part, on our ability to acquire patented technologies, patent portfolios, or companies holding such patented technologies and patent portfolios. Accordingly, we have engaged in acquisitions to expand our patent portfolios and we intend to continue to explore such acquisitions. Such acquisitions are subject to numerous risks, including the following: oour inability to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to any potential acquisition, or if we are able to enter into such agreement, our inability to consummate the potential acquisition;odifficulty integrating the operations, technology and personnel of the acquired entity;oour inability to achieve the anticipated financial and other benefits of the specific acquisition;odifficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during the transition and monetization process;odiversion of our management’s attention from other business concerns; andofailure of our due diligence process to identify significant issues, including issues with respect to patented technologies and patent portfolios, and other legal and financial contingencies.      If we are unable to manage these risks effectively as part of any acquisition, our business could be adversely affected.Our revenues are unpredictable, and this may harm our financial condition.     From November 12, 2012 to the present, our operating subsidiaries have executed our business strategy of acquiring patent portfolios and accompanying patent rights and monetizing the value of those assets.  As of December 31, 2014, on a consolidated basis, our operating subsidiaries owned, controlled or had economic rights to 378 patent assets, which include U.S. patents and certain foreign counterparts, covering technologies used in a wide variety of industries. These acquisitions continue to expand and diversify our revenue generating opportunities. However, due to the nature of our patent monetization business and uncertainties regarding the amount and timing of the receipt of funds from the monetization of our patent assets resulting in part from uncertainties regarding the outcome of enforcement actions, rates of adoption of our patented technologies, outlook for the businesses for defendants, and certain other factors, our revenues may vary substantially from quarter to quarter, which could make our business difficult to manage, adversely affect our business and operating results, cause our quarterly results to fall below expectations and adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.Our patent monetization cycle is lengthy and costly, and our marketing, legal and administrative efforts may be unsuccessful.     We expect significant marketing, legal and administrative expenses prior to generating revenue from monetization efforts.  We will also spend considerable time and resources educating defendants on the benefits of a settlement, prior to or during litigation, that may include a license of our patent rights.  As such, we may incur significant losses in any particular period before any associated revenue stream begins.     If our efforts to convince defendants of the benefits of a settlement arrangement prior to litigation are unsuccessful, we may need to continue with the litigation process or other enforcement action to protect our patent rights and to realize revenue from those rights.  We may also need to litigate to enforce the terms of existing agreements, protect our trade secrets, or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Enforcement proceedings are typically protracted and complex. The costs are typically substantial, and the outcomes are unpredictable. Enforcement actions will divert our managerial, technical, legal and financial resources from business operations.    -9-Table of Contents Our exposure to uncontrollable risks, including new legislation, court rulings or actions by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, could adversely affect our activities including our revenues, expenses and results of operations.     Our patent acquisition and monetization business is subject to numerous risks, including the following:     New legislation, regulations or rules related to obtaining patents or enforcing patents could significantly increase our operating costs and reduce our revenue and results of operations.     If new legislation, regulations or rules are implemented either by Congress, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the executive branch, or the courts, that impact the patent application process, the patent enforcement process, the rights of patent holders, or litigation practices, such changes could materially and negatively affect our revenue and expenses and, therefore, our results of operations and the overall success of our company.  Recently, United States patent laws were amended with the enactment of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the America Invents Act, which took effect on March 16, 2013. The America Invents Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. In general, the legislation attempts to address issues surrounding the enforceability of patents and the increase in patent litigation by, among other things, establishing new procedures for patent litigation. For example, the America Invents Act changes the way that parties may be joined in patent infringement actions, increasing the likelihood that such actions will need to be brought against individual allegedly-infringing parties by their respective individual actions or activities. In addition, the America Invents Act enacted a new inter-partes review, or IPR, process at the USPTO which can be used by defendants, and other individuals and entities, to separately challenge the validity of any patent. At this time, it is not clear what, if any, impact the America Invents Act will have on the operation of our patent monetization and enforcement business. However, the America Invents Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of our patented technologies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.  Patents from nine of our portfolios are currently the subject of inter-partes reviews.     In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice, or the DOJ, has conducted reviews of the patent system to evaluate the impact of patent assertion entities on industries in which those patents relate. It is possible that the findings and recommendations of the DOJ could impact the ability to effectively monetize and enforce standards-essential patents and could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of any such patented technologies. Also, the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, has published its intent to initiate a proposed study under Section 6(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act to evaluate the patent assertion practice and market impact of Patent Assertion Entities, or PAEs.  The FTC’s notice and request for public comment relating to the PAE study appeared in the Federal Register on October 3, 2013.  The FTC has solicited information from the Company regarding its portfolios and activities, and the Company is currently in the process of complying with the FTC request for such information. It is expected that the results of the PAE study by the FTC will be provided to Congress and other agencies, such as the DOJ, who could take action, including legislative proposals, based on the results of the study.     Finally, new rules regarding the burden of proof in patent enforcement actions could substantially increase the cost of our enforcement actions and new standards or limitations on liability for patent infringement could negatively impact our revenue derived from such enforcement actions.Changes in patent law could adversely impact our business.     Patent laws may continue to change and may alter the historically consistent protections afforded to owners of patent rights. Such changes may not be advantageous for us and may make it more difficult to obtain adequate patent protection to enforce our patents against infringing parties. Increased focus on the growing number of patent-related lawsuits may result in legislative changes that increase our costs and related risks of asserting patent enforcement actions. For instance, in December 2013, the United States House of Representatives passed a bill that would require non-practicing entities that bring patent infringement lawsuits to pay legal costs of the defendants, if the lawsuits are unsuccessful and certain standards are not met. Trial judges and juries often find it difficult to understand complex patent enforcement litigation, and as a result, we may need to appeal adverse decisions by lower courts in order to successfully enforce our patent rights.     It is difficult to predict the outcome of litigation, particularly patent enforcement litigation. It is often difficult for juries and trial judges to understand complex, patented technologies and, as a result, there is a higher rate of successful appeals in patent enforcement litigation than more standard business litigation. Such appeals are expensive and time consuming, resulting in increased costs and delayed final non-appealable judgments that can require payment of damages to the Company. Although we diligently pursue enforcement litigation, we cannot predict with significant reliability the decisions that may be made by juries and trial courts.   -10-Table of Contents More patent applications are filed each year resulting in longer delays in getting patents issued by the USPTO.     We hold and continue to acquire pending patents in the application or review phase. We believe there is a trend of increasing patent applications each year, which we believe is resulting in longer delays in obtaining approval of pending patent applications. The application delays could cause delays in monetizing such patents which could cause us to miss opportunities to license patents before other competing technologies are developed or introduced into the market. Patent enforcement litigation is taking longer.     Our patent enforcement actions are almost exclusively prosecuted in federal court. Federal trial courts that hear our patent enforcement actions also hear criminal and other cases. Criminal cases always take priority over our actions. As a result, it is difficult to predict the length of time it will take to complete an enforcement action. Moreover, we believe there is a trend in increasing numbers of civil and criminal proceedings and, as a result, we believe that the risk of delays in our patent enforcement actions has grown and will continue to grow and will increasingly affect our business in the future unless this trend changes. Any reductions in the funding of the USPTO could have an adverse impact on the cost of processing pending patent applications and the value of those pending patent applications.     Our ownership or acquisition of pending patent applications before the USPTO is subject to funding and other risks applicable to a government agency. The value of our patent portfolio is dependent, in part, on the issuance of patents in a timely manner, and any reductions in the funding of the USPTO could negatively impact the value of our assets. Further, reductions in funding from Congress could result in higher patent application filing and maintenance fees charged by the USPTO, causing an unexpected increase in our expenses.Our acquisitions of patent assets may be time consuming, complex and costly, which could adversely affect our operating results.     Acquisitions of patent or other intellectual property assets, are often time consuming, complex and costly to consummate. We may utilize many different transaction structures in our acquisitions and the terms of such acquisition agreements tend to be heavily negotiated. As a result, we expect to incur significant operating expenses and may be required to raise capital during the negotiations even if the acquisition is ultimately not consummated. Even if we are able to acquire particular patent assets, there is no guarantee that we will generate sufficient revenue related to those patent assets to offset the acquisition costs. While we will seek to conduct sufficient due diligence on the patent assets we are considering for acquisition, we may acquire patent assets from a seller who does not have proper title to those assets. In those cases, we may be required to spend significant resources to defend our ownership interest in the patent assets and, if we are not successful, our acquisition may be invalid, in which case we could lose part or all of our investment in the assets.     We may also identify patent or other patent assets that cost more than we are prepared to spend with our own capital resources. We may incur significant costs to organize and negotiate a structured acquisition that does not ultimately result in an acquisition of any patent assets or, if consummated, proves to be unprofitable for us. These higher costs could adversely affect our operating results and, if we incur losses, the value of our securities will decline.     In addition, we may acquire patents and technologies that are in the early stages of adoption in the commercial, industrial and consumer markets. Demand for some of these technologies will likely be untested and may be subject to fluctuation based upon the rate at which our companies may adopt our patented technologies in their products and services. As a result, there can be no assurance as to whether technologies we acquire or develop will have value that we can monetize.     -11-Table of ContentsIn certain acquisitions of patent assets, we may seek to defer payment or finance a portion of the acquisition price. This approach may put us at a competitive disadvantage and could result in harm to our business.     We have limited capital and may seek to negotiate acquisitions of patent or other intellectual property assets where we can defer payments or finance a portion of the acquisition price. These types of debt financing or deferred payment arrangements may not be as attractive to sellers of patent assets as receiving the full purchase price for those assets in cash at the closing of the acquisition. As a result, we might not compete effectively against other companies in the market for acquiring patent assets, many of whom have substantially greater cash resources than we have. In addition, any failure to satisfy any debt repayment obligations that we may incur, may result in adverse consequences to our operating results.Any failure to maintain or protect our patent assets could significantly impair our return on investment from such assets and harm our brand, our business and our operating results.     Our ability to operate our business and compete in the patent market largely depends on the superiority, uniqueness and value of our acquired patent assets.  To protect our proprietary rights, we rely on and will rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements, common interest agreements and agreements with our employees and third parties, and protective contractual provisions. No assurances can be given that any of the measures we undertake to protect and maintain the value of our assets will have any measure of success.     Following the acquisition of patent assets, we will likely be required to spend significant time and resources to maintain the effectiveness of those assets by paying maintenance fees and making filings with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We may acquire patent assets, including patent applications that require us to spend resources to prosecute such patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Further, there is a material risk that patent related claims (such as, for example, infringement claims (and/or claims for indemnification resulting therefrom), unenforceability claims, or invalidity claims) will be asserted or prosecuted against us, and such assertions or prosecutions could materially and adversely affect our business. Regardless of whether any such claims are valid or can be successfully asserted, defending such claims could cause us to incur significant costs and could divert resources away from our core business activities.     Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, any of the following or similar occurrences may reduce the value of our intellectual property:oour patent applications, trademarks and copyrights may not be granted and, if granted, may be challenged or invalidated;oissued trademarks, copyrights, or patents may not provide us with any competitive advantages when compared to potentially infringing other properties;oour efforts to protect our intellectual property rights may not be effective in preventing misappropriation of our technology; oroour efforts may not prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to or competitive with, or superior to those we acquire and/or prosecute.     Moreover, we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in certain foreign countries where we may do business in the future or from which competitors may operate. If we fail to maintain, defend or prosecute our patent assets properly, the value of those assets would be reduced or eliminated, and our business would be harmed.Weak global economic conditions may cause infringing parties to delay entering into settlement and licensing agreements, which could prolong our litigation and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.     Our business depends significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the United States and world economies have recently experienced weak economic conditions. Uncertainty about global economic conditions poses a risk as businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news and declines in income or asset values. This response could have a material adverse effect on the willingness of parties infringing on our assets to enter into settlements or other revenue generating agreements voluntarily. Entering into such agreements is critical to our business, and our failure to do so could cause material harm to our business.   -12-Table of ContentsIf we are unable to adequately protect our patent assets, we may not be able to compete effectively.     Our ability to compete depends in part upon the strength of the patents and patent rights that we own or may hereafter acquire. We rely on a combination of U.S. and foreign patents, copyrights, trademark, trade secret laws and other types of agreements to establish and protect our patent, intellectual property and proprietary rights. The efforts we take to protect our patents, intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective at stopping unauthorized use of our patents, intellectual property and proprietary rights. In addition, effective trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available or cost-effective in every country in which our services are made available. There may be instances where we are not able to fully protect or utilize our patent and other intellectual property in a manner that maximizes competitive advantage. If we are unable to protect our patent assets and intellectual property and proprietary rights from unauthorized use, the value of those assets may be reduced, which could negatively impact our business. Our inability to obtain appropriate protections for our intellectual property may also allow competitors to enter markets and produce or sell the same or similar products. In addition, protecting our patents and patent rights is expensive and diverts critical managerial resources. If any of the foregoing were to occur, or if we are otherwise unable to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.     If we are forced to resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights, the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive. In addition, our patent rights could be at risk if we are unsuccessful in, or cannot afford to pursue, those proceedings. We also rely on trade secrets and contract law to protect some of our patent rights and proprietary technology. We will enter into confidentiality and invention agreements with our employees and consultants. Nevertheless, these agreements may not be honored and they may not effectively protect our right to our un-patented trade secrets and know-how. Moreover, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and know-how.We expect that we will be substantially dependent on a concentrated number of customers. If we are unable to establish, maintain or replace our relationships with customers and develop a diversified customer base, our revenues may fluctuate and our growth may be limited.     A significant portion of our revenues will be generated from a limited number of customers and licenses to those customers. For the year ended December 31, 2014, five licenses with two licensees accounted for approximately 88% of our revenue. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to obtain additional licenses for the Company’s patents, or if we able to do so, that the licenses will be of the same or larger size allowing us to sustain or grow our revenue levels, respectively. If we are not able to generate licenses from the limited group of prospective customers that we anticipate may generate a substantial majority of our revenues in the future, or if they do not generate revenues at the levels or at the times that we anticipate, our ability to maintain or grow our revenues and our results of operations will be adversely affected.We acquired the rights to market and license a patent analytics tool from IP Navigation Group, LLC and will dedicate resources and incur costs in an effort to generate revenues.  We may not be able to generate revenues and there is a risk that the time spent marketing and licensing the tool will distract management from the enforcement of the Company’s patent portfolios.     We expect to dedicate resources and incur costs in the marketing and licensing of the patent analytics tool, named Opus Analytics, in order to generate revenue, but there are no assurances that our efforts will be successful.  We may not generate any revenues from the licensing of the tool or may not generate enough license revenue to exceed our costs.  Our efforts therefore could lead to losses and could have a material adverse affect on our income, expenses or results of operations.     In addition, the time and effort spent marketing and licensing Opus Analytics could distract the Company and its officers from the management of the balance of the Company’s business and have a deleterious effect on results from the enforcement of the Company’s patents and patent rights.  This could lead to either sub-par returns from the patent and patent right enforcement efforts or even total losses of the value of such patents and patent rights, leading to considerable losses.   -13-Table of ContentsRisks Related to Our IndebtednessOur cash flows and capital resources may be insufficient to make required payments on our indebtedness and future indebtedness.     As of December 31, 2014 and March 18, 2015, we have $22,488,065 and $29,488,065 of indebtedness outstanding. Our indebtedness could have important consequences to you. For example, it could:   •make it difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations;  •make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;  •limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements;  •expose us to interest rate fluctuations because the interest rate on the debt under the Credit Facility is variable;  •require us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for operations and other purposes;  •limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and  •place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that may have proportionately less debt and greater financial resources.     In addition, our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations depends on our successful financial and operating performance, cash flows and capital resources, which in turn depend upon prevailing economic conditions and certain financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among others:   •economic and demand factors affecting our industry;  •pricing pressures;  •increased operating costs;  •competitive conditions; and  •other operating difficulties.     If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt. In the event that we are required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations, the value realized on such assets or operations will depend on market conditions and the availability of buyers. Accordingly, any such sale may not, among other things, be for a sufficient dollar amount. Our obligations pursuant to the Loan Agreement are secured by a security interest in all of our assets, exclusive of intellectual property. The foregoing encumbrances may limit our ability to dispose of material assets or operations. We also may not be able to restructure our indebtedness on favorable economic terms, if at all.     We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including pursuant to the Fortress Documents (as defined herein). Our incurrence of additional indebtedness would intensify the risks described above.    -14-Table of Contents The Fortress Documents contain various covenants limiting the discretion of our management in operating our business. On January 29, 2015, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a series of Agreements including a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Fortress Purchase Agreement”) and a Subscription Agreement with DBD Credit Funding, LLC (“DBD”), an affiliate of Fortress Credit Corp., under which the Company sold to the purchasers: (i) $15,000,000 original principal amount of Senior Secured Notes (the “Fortress Notes”), (ii) a right to receive a portion of certain proceeds from monetization net revenues received by the Company (after receipt by the Company of $15,000,000 of monetization net revenues and repayment of the Fortress Notes), (iii) a five-year warrant (the “Fortress Warrant”) to purchase 100,000 shares of the Issuer’s Common Stock exercisable at $7.44 per share, subject to adjustment; and (iv) 134,409 shares of the Issuer’s Common Stock.  Pursuant to the Fortress Purchase Agreement, as security for the payment and performance in full of the secured obligations, the Company and certain subsidiaries executed and delivered in favor of the purchasers a Security Agreement and a Patent Security Agreement, including a pledge of the Company’s interests in certain of its subsidiaries (together with the Fortress Purchase Agreement, the Fortress Notes and the Fortress Warrant, the “Fortress Documents”).     The Fortress Documents contains, subject to certain carve-outs, various restrictive covenants that limit our management's discretion in operating our business. In particular, these instruments limit our ability to, among other things:   •incur additional debt;  •grant liens on assets;  •dispose assets outside the ordinary course of business; and   •make fundamental business changes.     If we fail to comply with the restrictions in the Fortress Documents, a default may allow the creditors under the relevant instruments to accelerate the related debt and to exercise their remedies under these agreements, which will typically include the right to declare the principal amount of that debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other related amounts, immediately due and payable, to exercise any remedies the creditors may have to foreclose on assets that are subject to liens securing that debt and to terminate any commitments they had made to supply further funds.The rights of the holders of the Company’s Common Stock will be subordinate to our creditors.     On May 2, 2014, we issued three promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 (which increased to $6,000,000 as the promissory notes were not paid in full on or prior to June 30, 2014) and preferred stock and warrants.  On October 13, 2014, we issued a note in the amount of $9,000,000 and assumed existing indebtedness in the amount of $5,500,000, both pursuant to the acquisition of three patent portfolios from MedTech Development, LLC. On October 16, 2014, we issued Convertible Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $5,550,000, which mature on October 16, 2018. On January 29, 2015 and February 12, 2015, we issued to DBD notes in the principal amounts of $15,000,000 and $5,000,000, respectively.     Accordingly, the holders of Common Stock will rank junior to such indebtedness, as well as to other non-equity claims on the Company and our assets, including claims in our liquidation.Risks Relating to Our Stock Our management will be able to exert significant influence over us to the detriment of minority stockholders.     Our executive officers and directors beneficially own approximately 12.1% of our outstanding Common Stock as of March 18, 2015. As a result, our management could exert significant influence over our business and affairs and all matters requiring stockholder approval, including mergers or other fundamental corporate transactions. The concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and could affect the market price of our Common Stock.   -15-Table of Contents Exercise of warrants will dilute stockholders’ percentage of ownership.     We have issued options and warrants to purchase our Common Stock to our officers, directors, consultants and certain shareholders.   In the future, we may grant additional options, warrants and convertible securities. The exercise or conversion of options, warrants or convertible securities will dilute the percentage ownership of our stockholders. The dilutive effect of the exercise or conversion of these securities may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional capital. The holders of these securities may be expected to exercise or convert them when we would be able to obtain additional equity capital on terms more favorable than these securities. Our Common Stock may be delisted from The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC if we fail to comply with continued listing standards.     Our Common Stock is currently traded on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC under the symbol “MARA.”  If we fail to meet any of the continued listing standards of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, our Common Stock could be delisted from The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC.  These continued listing standards include specifically enumerated criteria, such as: ●a $1.00 minimum closing bid price;●stockholders’ equity of $2.5 million;●500,000 shares of publicly-held Common Stock with a market value of at least $1 million;●300 round-lot stockholders; and●compliance with NASDAQ’s corporate governance requirements, as well as additional or more stringent criteria that may be applied in the exercise of NASDAQ’s discretionary authority. We could fail in future financing efforts or be delisted from NASDAQ if we fail to receive stockholder approval when needed.     We are required under the NASDAQ rules to obtain stockholder approval for any issuance of additional equity securities that would comprise 20% or more of the total shares of our Common Stock outstanding before the issuance of such securities sold at a discount to the greater of book or market value in an offering that is not deemed to be a “public offering” by NASDAQ.  Funding of our operations and acquisitions of assets may require issuance of additional equity securities at a discount that would comprise 20% or more of the total shares of our Common Stock outstanding, but we might not be successful in obtaining the required stockholder approval for such an issuance.  If we are unable to obtain financing due to stockholder approval difficulties, such failure may have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations.Our Common Stock may be affected by limited trading volume and price fluctuations, which could adversely impact the value of our Common Stock.     There has been limited trading in our Common Stock and there can be no assurance that an active trading market in our Common Stock will either develop or be maintained. Our Common Stock has experienced, and is likely to experience in the future, significant price and volume fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock without regard to our operating performance. In addition, we believe that factors such as quarterly fluctuations in our financial results and changes in the overall economy or the condition of the financial markets could cause the price of our Common Stock to fluctuate substantially. These fluctuations may also cause short sellers to periodically enter the market in the belief that we will have poor results in the future. We cannot predict the actions of market participants and, therefore, can offer no assurances that the market for our Common Stock will be stable or appreciate over time.    -16-Table of ContentsIn connection with the issuance of preferred stock, convertible notes and warrants in 2014 and subsequently, holders of the Company’s Common Stock will experience immediate and substantial dilution upon the conversion of such preferred stock and the exercise of such warrants.     On May 1, 2014, we issued 2,047,158 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, 782,000 shares of our par value $0.0001 Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series B Preferred Stock”) and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 511,790 shares of Common Stock.   In addition, pursuant to a consulting agreement entered into in September 2014, we issued 100,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock on September 17, 2014 and 16,666 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock on October 17, 2014, November 17, 2014 and December 17, 2014.  We issued Convertible Notes and Warrants to purchase 258,998 shares of Common Stock on October 16, 2014.  Finally, we issued a five-year warrant to purchase 100,000 shares of our common stock exercisable at $7.44 per share, and 134,409 shares of Common Stock to DBD Credit Funding, LLC (“DBD”) on January 29, 2015. While all of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock was automatically converted pursuant to the terms of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation during the year ended December 31, 2014 and Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $5,050,000 have been redeemed in February, 2015, upon conversion of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, the remaining Convertible Notes (if converted) and exercise of the warrants, you will experience dilution.  As of March 18, 2015, we have 13,918,177 shares of Common Stock outstanding.  Assuming full conversion of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, the Convertible Notes, after giving effect to the repayment of the Notes and the exercise of the warrants issued on May 1, 2014, October 16, 2014 and January 29, 2015, the number of shares of our Common Stock outstanding will increase 1,919,455 shares from 13,918,177 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of March 18, 2015 to 15,837,632 shares of Common stock outstanding.Our stock price may be volatile.     The market price of our Common Stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:ochanges in our industry; ocompetitive pricing pressures;oour ability to obtain working capital financing;oadditions or departures of key personnel;osales of our Common Stock;oour ability to execute our business plan;ooperating results that fall below expectations;oloss of any strategic relationship;oregulatory developments; andoeconomic and other external factors.      In addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.We have never paid nor do we expect in the near future to pay cash dividends.     On November 19, 2014, we declared a stock dividend pursuant to which holders of our common stock, par value $0.0001 as of the close of business of the record date of December 15, 2014 shall receive one additional share of common stock for each share of common stock held by such holders. Other than as described herein, we have never paid cash dividends on our capital stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Common Stock for the foreseeable future.  While it is possible that we may declare a dividend after a large settlement, investors should not rely on such a possibility, nor should they rely on an investment in us if they require income generated from dividends paid on our capital stock.  Any income derived from our Common Stock would only come from rise in the market price of our Common Stock, which is uncertain and unpredictable.   -17-Table of ContentsOffers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock may cause the price of our Common Stock to decline.     If our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our Common Stock in the public market upon the expiration of any statutory holding period or lockup agreements, under Rule 144, or issued upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or other convertible securities, it could create a circumstance commonly referred to as an ""overhang"" and in anticipation of which the market price of our Common Stock could fall.  The existence of an overhang, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could make more difficult our ability to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.  The shares of our restricted Common Stock will be freely tradable upon the earlier of: (i) effectiveness of a registration statement covering such shares and (ii) the date on which such shares may be sold without registration pursuant to Rule 144 (or other applicable exemption) under the Securities Act.Because we became public by means of a reverse merger, we may not be able to attract the attention of major brokerage firms.     There may be risks associated with us becoming public through a “reverse merger.” Securities analysts of major brokerage firms may not provide coverage of us since there is no incentive to brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our Common Stock.  No assurance can be given that brokerage firms will, in the future, want to conduct any secondary offerings on our behalf. Investor relations activities, nominal “float” and supply and demand factors may affect the price of our stock.     We expect to utilize various techniques such as non-deal road shows and investor relations campaigns in order to create investor awareness for us.  These campaigns may include personal, video and telephone conferences with investors and prospective investors in which our business practices are described.  We may provide compensation to investor relations firms and pay for newsletters, websites, mailings and email campaigns that are produced by third parties based upon publicly-available information concerning us. We do not intend to review or approve the content of such analysts’ reports or other materials based upon analysts’ own research or methods.  Investor relations firms should generally disclose when they are compensated for their efforts, but whether such disclosure is made or complete is not under our control.   In addition, investors in us may, from time to time, also take steps to encourage investor awareness through similar activities that may be undertaken at the expense of the investors.  Investor awareness activities may also be suspended or discontinued which may impact the trading market our Common Stock. If we lose key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully manage our business and achieve our objectives.     We believe our future success will depend upon our ability to retain our key management, including Doug Croxall, our Chief Executive Officer.  In addition, Erich Spangenberg, the founder and former Chief Executive Officer and principal of IP Nav and a significant stockholder of the Company, is also important to the success of our Company.  We do not have any agreement with Mr. Spangenberg related to services he is to perform for IP Nav or the Company.  We may not be successful in attracting, assimilating and retaining our employees in the future.  The loss of Mr. Croxall would have a material adverse effect on our operations.  We have entered into an amendment to the employment agreement with Mr. Croxall, which extends the term of his employment agreement to November 2017.  We are competing for employees against companies that are more established than we are and have the ability to pay more cash compensation than we do.  As of the date hereof, we have not experienced problems hiring employees.If we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of internal control, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately and timely or to prevent fraud. Any inability to report and file our financial results accurately and timely could harm our reputation and adversely impact the trading price of our Common Stock.     Effective internal control is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, we may not be able to manage our business as effectively as we would if an effective control environment existed, and our business and reputation with investors may be harmed. As a result, our small size and any future internal control deficiencies may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operation and access to capital. We have not performed an in-depth analysis to determine if historical un-discovered failures of internal controls exist, and may in the future discover areas of our internal control that need improvement.    -18-Table of ContentsAs a result of its internal control assessment, the Company determined there is a material weakness with respect to segregation of duties.     The Company determined that there is a material weakness in its internal controls with respect to the segregation of duties.  Since the Company currently has six employees, most of whom have no involvement in our financial controls and reporting, we are unable to sufficiently distribute reporting and accounting to tasks across enough individuals to insure that the Company does not have a material weakness in its financial reporting system. "
