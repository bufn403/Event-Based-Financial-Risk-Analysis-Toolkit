17,CFR,CULLEN/FROST BANKERS INC,2006-02-03,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS"" -->ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS     An investment in the Corporations common stock is subjectto risks inherent to the Corporations business. Thematerial risks and uncertainties that management believes affectthe Corporation are described below. Before making an investmentdecision, you should carefully consider the risks anduncertainties described below together with all of the otherinformation included or incorporated by reference in thisreport. The risks and uncertainties described below are not theonly ones facing the Corporation. Additional risks anduncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on orthat management currently deems immaterial may also impair theCorporations business operations. This report is qualifiedin its entirety by these risk factors.     If any of the following risks actually occur, theCorporations financial condition and results of operationscould be materially and adversely affected. If this were tohappen, the value of the Corporations common stock coulddecline significantly, and you could lose all or part of yourinvestment.Risks Related To The Corporations BusinessThe Corporation Is Subject To Interest Rate Risk     The Corporations earnings and cash flows are largelydependent upon its net interest income. Net interest income isthe difference between interest income earned oninterest-earning assets such as loans and securities andinterest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such asdeposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitiveto many factors that are beyond the Corporations control,including general economic conditions and policies of variousgovernmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, theBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Changes inmonetary policy, including changes in interest rates, couldinfluence not only the interest the Corporation receives onloans and securities and the amount of interest it pays ondeposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect(i) the Corporations ability to originate loans andobtain deposits, (ii) the fair value of theCorporations financial assets and liabilities, and(iii) the average duration of the Corporationsmortgage-backed securities portfolio. If the interest rates paidon deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate thanthe interest rates received on loans and other investments, theCorporations net interest income, and therefore earnings,could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adverselyaffected if the interest rates received on loans and otherinvestments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid ondeposits and other borrowings.     Although management believes it has implemented effective assetand liability management strategies, including the use ofderivatives as hedging instruments, to reduce the potentialeffects of changes in interest rates on the Corporationsresults of operations, any substantial, unexpected, prolongedchange in market interest rates could have a material adverseeffect on the Corporations financial condition and resultsof operations. See the section captioned Net InterestIncome in Item 7. Managements Discussion andAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operationslocated elsewhere in this report for further discussion relatedto the Corporations management of interest rate risk.The Corporation Is Subject To Lending Risk     There are inherent risks associated with the Corporationslending activities. These risks include, among other things, theimpact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economicconditions in the markets14Table of Contentswhere the Corporation operates as well as those across the Stateof Texas and the United States. Increases in interest ratesand/or weakening economic conditions could adversely impact theability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value ofthe collateral securing these loans. The Corporation is alsosubject to various laws and regulations that affect its lendingactivities. Failure to comply with applicable laws andregulations could subject the Corporation to regulatoryenforcement action that could result in the assessment ofsignificant civil money penalties against the Corporation.     As of December 31, 2005, approximately 80% of theCorporations loan portfolio consisted of commercial andindustrial, construction and commercial real estate loans. Thesetypes of loans are generally viewed as having more risk ofdefault than residential real estate loans or consumer loans.These types of loans are also typically larger than residentialreal estate loans and consumer loans. Because theCorporations loan portfolio contains a significant numberof commercial and industrial, construction and commercial realestate loans with relatively large balances, the deteriorationof one or a few of these loans could cause a significantincrease in non-performing loans. An increase in non-performingloans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans,an increase in the provision for possible loan losses and anincrease in loan charge-offs, all of which could have a materialadverse effect on the Corporations financial condition andresults of operations. See the section captionedLoans in Item 7. Managements Discussionand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operationslocated elsewhere in this report for further discussion relatedto commercial and industrial, construction and commercial realestate loans.The Corporations Allowance For Possible Loan Losses May    Be Insufficient     The Corporation maintains an allowance for possible loan losses,which is a reserve established through a provision for possibleloan losses charged to expense, that representsmanagements best estimate of probable losses that havebeen incurred within the existing portfolio of loans. Theallowance, in the judgment of management, is necessary toreserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loanportfolio. The level of the allowance reflects managementscontinuing evaluation of industry concentrations; specificcredit risks; loan loss experience; current loan portfolioquality; present economic, political and regulatory conditionsand unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio.The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance forpossible loan losses inherently involves a high degree ofsubjectivity and requires the Corporation to make significantestimates of current credit risks and future trends, all ofwhich may undergo material changes. Changes in economicconditions affecting borrowers, new information regardingexisting loans, identification of additional problem loans andother factors, both within and outside of the Corporationscontrol, may require an increase in the allowance for possibleloan losses. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodicallyreview the Corporations allowance for loan losses and mayrequire an increase in the provision for possible loan losses orthe recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgmentsdifferent than those of management. In addition, if charge-offsin future periods exceed the allowance for possible loan losses,the Corporation will need additional provisions to increase theallowance for possible loan losses. Any increases in theallowance for possible loan losses will result in a decrease innet income and, possibly, capital, and may have a materialadverse effect on the Corporations financial condition andresults of operations. See the section captioned Allowancefor Possible Loan Losses in Item 7. ManagementsDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results ofOperations located elsewhere in this report for furtherdiscussion related to the Corporations process fordetermining the appropriate level of the allowance for possibleloan losses.The Corporation Is Subject To Environmental Liability Risk    Associated With Lending Activities     A significant portion of the Corporations loan portfoliois secured by real property. During the ordinary course ofbusiness, the Corporation may foreclose on and take title toproperties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a riskthat hazardous or toxic substances could be found on theseproperties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, theCorporation may be liable for remediation costs, as well as forpersonal injury and property damage. Environmental laws mayrequire the Corporation to incur substantial expenses and maymaterially reduce the affected propertys value or limitthe Corporations ability to use or sell the affectedproperty. In addition, future laws or more stringentinterpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existinglaws may increase the Corporations exposure toenvironmental liability. Although the Corporation15Table of Contentshas policies and procedures to perform an environmental reviewbefore initiating any foreclosure action on real property, thesereviews may not be sufficient to detect all potentialenvironmental hazards. The remediation costs and any otherfinancial liabilities associated with an environmental hazardcould have a material adverse effect on the Corporationsfinancial condition and results of operations.The Corporations Profitability Depends Significantly On    Economic Conditions In The State Of Texas     The Corporations success depends primarily on the generaleconomic conditions of the State of Texas and the specific localmarkets in which the Corporation operates. Unlike largernational or other regional banks that are more geographicallydiversified, the Corporation provides banking and financialservices to customers primarily in the Texas metropolitan areasof Austin, Boerne, Corpus Christi, Dallas, Fort Worth,Galveston, Harlingen, Houston, McAllen, New Braunfels,San Antonio and San Marcos. The local economicconditions in these areas have a significant impact on thedemand for the Corporations products and services as wellas the ability of the Corporations customers to repayloans, the value of the collateral securing loans and thestability of the Corporations deposit funding sources. Asignificant decline in general economic conditions, caused byinflation, recession, acts of terrorism, outbreak of hostilitiesor other international or domestic occurrences, unemployment,changes in securities markets or other factors could impactthese local economic conditions and, in turn, have a materialadverse effect on the Corporations financial condition andresults of operations.The Corporation Operates In A Highly Competitive Industry and    Market Area     The Corporation faces substantial competition in all areas ofits operations from a variety of different competitors, many ofwhich are larger and may have more financial resources. Suchcompetitors primarily include national, regional, and communitybanks within the various markets the Corporation operates.Additionally, variousout-of-state banks havebegun to enter or have announced plans to enter the market areasin which the Corporation currently operates. The Corporationalso faces competition from many other types of financialinstitutions, including, without limitation, savings and loans,credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurancecompanies, factoring companies and other financialintermediaries. The financial services industry could becomeeven more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory andtechnological changes and continued consolidation. Banks,securities firms and insurance companies can merge under theumbrella of a financial holding company, which can offervirtually any type of financial service, including banking,securities underwriting, insurance (both agency andunderwriting) and merchant banking. Also, technology has loweredbarriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offerproducts and services traditionally provided by banks, such asautomatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of theCorporations competitors have fewer regulatory constraintsand may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to theirsize, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scaleand, as a result, may offer a broader range of products andservices as well as better pricing for those products andservices than the Corporation can.     The Corporations ability to compete successfully dependson a number of factors, including, among other things:      The ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term    customer relationships based on top quality service, high    ethical standards and safe, sound assets.       The ability to expand the Corporations market position.       The scope, relevance and pricing of products and services    offered to meet customer needs and demands.       The rate at which the Corporation introduces new products and    services relative to its competitors.       Customer satisfaction with the Corporations level of    service.       Industry and general economic trends.16Table of Contents     Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantlyweaken the Corporations competitive position, which couldadversely affect the Corporations growth andprofitability, which, in turn, could have a material adverseeffect on the Corporations financial condition and resultsof operations.The Corporation Is Subject To Extensive Government Regulation    and Supervision     The Corporation, primarily through Cullen/Frost, Frost Bank andcertain non-bank subsidiaries, is subject to extensive federaland state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations areprimarily intended to protect depositors funds, federaldeposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, notshareholders. These regulations affect the Corporationslending practices, capital structure, investment practices,dividend policy and growth, among other things. Congress andfederal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws,regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes tostatutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changesin interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations orpolicies, could affect the Corporation in substantial andunpredictable ways. Such changes could subject the Corporationto additional costs, limit the types of financial services andproducts the Corporation may offer and/or increase the abilityof non-banks to offer competing financial services and products,among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations orpolicies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civilmoney penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have amaterial adverse effect on the Corporations business,financial condition and results of operations. While theCorporation has policies and procedures designed to prevent anysuch violations, there can be no assurance that such violationswill not occur. See the section captioned Supervision andRegulation in Item 1. Business andNote 12  Regulatory Matters in the notes toconsolidated financial statements included in Item 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, which are locatedelsewhere in this report.The Corporations Controls and Procedures May Fail or Be    Circumvented     Management regularly reviews and updates the Corporationsinternal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, andcorporate governance policies and procedures. Any system ofcontrols, however well designed and operated, is based in parton certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, notabsolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met.Any failure or circumvention of the Corporations controlsand procedures or failure to comply with regulations related tocontrols and procedures could have a material adverse effect onthe Corporations business, results of operations andfinancial condition.New Lines of Business or New Products and Services May    Subject The Corporation to Additional Risks     From time to time, the Corporation may implement new lines ofbusiness or offer new products and services within existinglines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertaintiesassociated with these efforts, particularly in instances wherethe markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketingnew lines of business and/or new products and services theCorporation may invest significant time and resources. Initialtimetables for the introduction and development of new lines ofbusiness and/or new products or services may not be achieved andprice and profitability targets may not prove feasible. Externalfactors, such as compliance with regulations, competitivealternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impactthe successful implementation of a new line of business or a newproduct or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/ornew product or service could have a significant impact on theeffectiveness of the Corporations system of internalcontrols. Failure to successfully manage these risks in thedevelopment and implementation of new lines of business or newproducts or services could have a material adverse effect on theCorporations business, results of operations and financialcondition.Cullen/Frost Relies On Dividends From Its Subsidiaries For    Most Of Its Revenue     Cullen/Frost is a separate and distinct legal entity from itssubsidiaries. It receives substantially all of its revenue fromdividends from its subsidiaries. These dividends are theprincipal source of funds to pay dividends on theCorporations common stock and interest and principal onCullen/Frosts debt. Various federal and/or state laws andregulations limit the amount of dividends that Frost Bank andcertain non-bank subsidiaries may pay to Cullen/Frost. Also,Cullen/Frosts right to participate in a distribution ofassets upon17Table of Contentsa subsidiarys liquidation or reorganization is subject tothe prior claims of the subsidiarys creditors. In theevent Frost Bank is unable to pay dividends to Cullen/Frost,Cullen/Frost may not be able to service debt, pay obligations orpay dividends on the Corporations common stock. Theinability to receive dividends from Frost Bank could have amaterial adverse effect on the Corporations business,financial condition and results of operations. See the sectioncaptioned Supervision and Regulation in Item 1.Business and Note 12  Regulatory Matters in thenotes to consolidated financial statements included inItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, whichare located elsewhere in this report.Potential Acquisitions May Disrupt The Corporations    Business and Dilute Stockholder Value     The Corporation seeks merger or acquisition partners that areculturally similar and have experienced management and possesseither significant market presence or have potential forimproved profitability through financial management, economiesof scale or expanded services. Acquiring other banks,businesses, or branches involves various risks commonlyassociated with acquisitions, including, among other things:      Potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the    target company.       Exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company.       Difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and    personnel of the target company.       Potential disruption to the Corporations business.       Potential diversion of the Corporations managements    time and attention.       The possible loss of key employees and customers of the target    company.       Difficulty in estimating the value of the target company.       Potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may    affect the target company.     The Corporation regularly evaluates merger and acquisitionopportunities and conducts due diligence activities related topossible transactions with other financial institutions andfinancial services companies. As a result, merger or acquisitiondiscussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place andfuture mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt or equitysecurities may occur at any time. Acquisitions typically involvethe payment of a premium over book and market values, and,therefore, some dilution of the Corporations tangible bookvalue and net income per common share may occur in connectionwith any future transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize theexpected revenue increases, cost savings, increases ingeographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefitsfrom an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on theCorporations financial condition and results of operations.     During 2005, the Corporation acquired Horizon Capital Bank(Houston market area) and announced definitive agreements toacquire Texas Community Bancshares, Inc. (Dallas market area)and Alamo Corporation of Texas (Rio Grande Valley market area).Details of these transactions are presented inNote 2  Mergers and Acquisitions in the notes toconsolidated financial statements included in Item 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, which is locatedelsewhere in this report.The Corporation May Not Be Able To Attract and Retain SkilledPeople     The Corporations success depends, in large part, on itsability to attract and retain key people. Competition for thebest people in most activities engaged in by the Corporation canbe intense and the Corporation may not be able to hire people orto retain them. The unexpected loss of services of one or moreof the Corporations key personnel could have a materialadverse impact on the Corporations business because oftheir skills, knowledge of the Corporations market, yearsof industry experience and the difficulty of promptly findingqualified replacement personnel. The Corporation does notcurrently have employment agreements or non-competitionagreements with any of its senior officers.18Table of ContentsThe Corporations Information Systems May Experience An    Interruption Or Breach In Security     The Corporation relies heavily on communications and informationsystems to conduct its business. Any failure, interruption orbreach in security of these systems could result in failures ordisruptions in the Corporations customer relationshipmanagement, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems.While the Corporation has policies and procedures designed toprevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption orsecurity breach of its information systems, there can be noassurance that any such failures, interruptions or securitybreaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will beadequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures,interruptions or security breaches of the Corporationsinformation systems could damage the Corporationsreputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject theCorporation to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose theCorporation to civil litigation and possible financialliability, any of which could have a material adverse effect onthe Corporations financial condition and results ofoperations.The Corporation Continually Encounters Technological    Change     The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapidtechnological change with frequent introductions of newtechnology-driven products and services. The effective use oftechnology increases efficiency and enables financialinstitutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. TheCorporations future success depends, in part, upon itsability to address the needs of its customers by usingtechnology to provide products and services that will satisfycustomer demands, as well as to create additional efficienciesin the Corporations operations. Many of theCorporations competitors have substantially greaterresources to invest in technological improvements. TheCorporation may not be able to effectively implement newtechnology-driven products and services or be successful inmarketing these products and services to its customers. Failureto successfully keep pace with technological change affectingthe financial services industry could have a material adverseimpact on the Corporations business and, in turn, theCorporations financial condition and results of operations.The Corporation Is Subject To Claims and Litigation    Pertaining To Fiduciary Responsibility     From time to time, customers make claims and take legal actionpertaining to the Corporations performance of itsfiduciary responsibilities. Whether customer claims and legalaction related to the Corporations performance of itsfiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded, if suchclaims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorableto the Corporation they may result in significant financialliability and/or adversely affect the market perception of theCorporation and its products and services as well as impactcustomer demand for those products and services. Any financialliability or reputation damage could have a material adverseeffect on the Corporations business, which, in turn, couldhave a material adverse effect on the Corporationsfinancial condition and results of operations.Severe Weather, Natural Disasters, Acts Of War Or Terrorism    and Other External Events Could Significantly Impact The    Corporations Business     Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism andother adverse external events could have a significant impact onthe Corporations ability to conduct business. Such eventscould affect the stability of the Corporations depositbase, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstandingloans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, causesignificant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/orcause the Corporation to incur additional expenses. For example,during 2005, hurricanes Katrina and Rita made landfall andsubsequently caused extensive flooding and destruction along thecoastal areas of the Gulf of Mexico, including communities wherethe Corporation conducts business. Operations in several of theCompanys markets were disrupted by both the evacuation oflarge portions of the population as well as damage and or lackof access to the Companys banking and operationfacilities. While the impact of these hurricanes did notsignificantly affect the Corporation, other severe weather ornatural disasters, acts of war or terrorism or other adverseexternal events may occur in the future. Although management hasestablished disaster recovery policies and procedures, theoccurrence of any such event could have a material adverseeffect on the Corporations business, which, in turn, couldhave a material adverse effect on the Corporationsfinancial condition and results of operations.19Table of ContentsRisks Associated With The Corporations Common StockThe Corporations Stock Price Can Be Volatile     Stock price volatility may make it more difficult for you toresell your common stock when you want and at prices you findattractive. The Corporations stock price can fluctuatesignificantly in response to a variety of factors including,among other things:      Actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of    operations.       Recommendations by securities analysts.       Operating and stock price performance of other companies that    investors deem comparable to the Corporation.       News reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in    the financial services industry.       Perceptions in the marketplace regarding the Corporation and/or    its competitors.       New technology used, or services offered, by competitors.       Significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic    partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or    involving the Corporation or its competitors.       Failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated    benefits from acquisitions.       Changes in government regulations.       Geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or    military conflicts.     General market fluctuations, industry factors and generaleconomic and political conditions and events, such as economicslowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or credit losstrends, could also cause the Corporations stock price todecrease regardless of operating results.The Trading Volume In The Corporations Common Stock Is    Less Than That Of Other Larger Financial Services Companies     Although the Corporations common stock is listed fortrading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the tradingvolume in its common stock is less than that of other largerfinancial services companies. A public trading market having thedesired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderlinessdepends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers andsellers of the Corporations common stock at any giventime. This presence depends on the individual decisions ofinvestors and general economic and market conditions over whichthe Corporation has no control. Given the lower trading volumeof the Corporations common stock, significant sales of theCorporations common stock, or the expectation of thesesales, could cause the Corporations stock price to fall.An Investment In The Corporations Common Stock Is Not    An Insured Deposit     The Corporations common stock is not a bank deposit and,therefore, is not insured against loss by the Federal DepositInsurance Corporation (FDIC), any other deposit insurance fundor by any other public or private entity. Investment in theCorporations common stock is inherently risky for thereasons described in this Risk Factors
 section andelsewhere in this report and is subject to the same marketforces that affect the price of common stock in any company. Asa result, if you acquire the Corporations common stock,you may lose some or all of your investment.The Corporations Articles Of Incorporation,    By-Laws and Shareholders Rights Plan As Well As Certain Banking    Laws May Have An Anti-Takeover Effect     Provisions of the Corporations articles of incorporationand by-laws, federal banking laws, including regulatory approvalrequirements, and the Corporations stock purchase rightsplan could make it more20Table of Contentsdifficult for a third party to acquire the Corporation, even ifdoing so would be perceived to be beneficial to theCorporations shareholders. The combination of theseprovisions effectively inhibits a non-negotiated merger or otherbusiness combination, which, in turn, could adversely affect themarket price of the Corporations common stock.Risks Associated With The Corporations IndustryThe Earnings Of Financial Services Companies Are    Significantly Affected By General Business And Economic    Conditions     The Corporations operations and profitability are impactedby general business and economic conditions in the United Statesand abroad. These conditions include short-term and long-terminterest rates, inflation, money supply, political issues,legislative and regulatory changes, fluctuations in both debtand equity capital markets, broad trends in industry andfinance, and the strength of the U.S. economy and the localeconomies in which the Corporation operates, all of which arebeyond the Corporations control. A deterioration ineconomic conditions could result in an increase in loandelinquencies and non-performing assets, decreases in loancollateral values and a decrease in demand for theCorporations products and services, among other things,any of which could have a material adverse impact on theCorporations financial condition and results of operations.Financial Services Companies Depend On The Accuracy And    Completeness Of Information About Customers And    Counterparties     In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into othertransactions, the Corporation may rely on information furnishedby or on behalf of customers and counterparties, includingfinancial statements, credit reports and other financialinformation. The Corporation may also rely on representations ofthose customers, counterparties or other third parties, such asindependent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness ofthat information. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financialstatements, credit reports or other financial information couldhave a material adverse impact on the Corporationsbusiness and, in turn, the Corporations financialcondition and results of operations.Consumers May Decide Not To Use Banks To Complete Their    Financial Transactions     Technology and other changes are allowing parties to completefinancial transactions that historically have involved banksthrough alternative methods. For example, consumers can nowmaintain funds that would have historically been held as bankdeposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds. Consumers canalso complete transactions such as paying bills and/ortransferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. Theprocess of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known asdisintermediation, could result in the loss of feeincome, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the relatedincome generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenuestreams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds couldhave a material adverse effect on the Corporationsfinancial condition and results of operations"
