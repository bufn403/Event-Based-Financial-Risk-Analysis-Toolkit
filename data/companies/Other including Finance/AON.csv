The risk factors set forth below reflect risks associated with our existing and potential businesses and the industries in which we operate generally and contain “forward-looking statements” as discussed in the “Business” Section of Part I, Item 1 of this report. Readers should consider these risks in addition to the other information contained in this report because our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected if any of these risks were to actually occur and the occurrence of such risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in or implied by the forward-looking statements in this document and elsewhere.Risk Factors
 SummaryThe following is a summary of the principal risks associated with our businesses and the industries in which we operate generally as described in more detail in this report. We encourage you to carefully review the full risk factors immediately following this summary as well as the other information in this report.Risks Related to Our Business•An overall decline in economic and business activity could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of our business.•We face significant competitive pressures from traditional and non-traditional competitors that could affect our business.•If we are unable to effectively develop and implement innovative strategies, efficiencies and new solutions for our clients, our reputation, ability to compete effectively and financial condition may be adversely affected. •If our clients are not satisfied with our services, we may face additional cost, loss of profit opportunities, damage to our reputation, or legal liability.•Revenues from commission arrangements may fluctuate due to many factors, including cyclical or permanent changes in the insurance and reinsurance markets outside of our control.•The profitability of our operations may not meet our expectations due to unexpected costs, cost overruns, inflation, early contract terminations, unrealized assumptions used in our contract bidding process or the inability to maintain our prices. Financial Risks•We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows. Similarly, changes in interest rates and deterioration of credit quality could reduce the value of our cash balances and investment portfolios and adversely affect our financial condition or results.•We have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility. In addition, a decline in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper may adversely affect our borrowing costs, access to capital, and financial flexibility.•Our tax assets and liabilities are subject to a variety of different factors, including the adoption and implementation of OECD tax proposals, which could create volatility in our global effective tax rate, expose us to greater than anticipated tax liabilities or cause us to adjust previously recognized tax assets and liabilities.10•We are a holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends or other payments in needed amounts from our subsidiaries.Legal and Regulatory Risks•We are subject to E&O claims against us as well as other contingencies and legal proceedings, some of which, if determined unfavorably to us, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.•Our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which could reduce our profitability, limit our growth, or subject us to legal and regulatory actions.•Failure to protect our intellectual property rights, or allegations that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others, could harm our reputation, ability to compete effectively, and financial condition.Operational Risks•Our results of operations have been adversely affected and could be materially adversely affected in the future by the effects of natural or man-made disasters, including health pandemics or the impacts of climate change.•Our success depends on our ability to retain, attract and develop experienced and qualified personnel, including our senior management team and other professional personnel.•We may not recognize all of the expected benefits from our Accelerating Aon United program and other operation improvement initiatives. Risks Related to Technology, Cybersecurity, and Data Protection•We rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business. Any significant system or network disruption due to a breach in the security of our information technology systems could have a negative impact on our reputation, operations, sales, and operating results.•Improper disclosure of confidential, personal, or proprietary data could result in regulatory scrutiny, legal liability, or harm to our reputation.Risks Related to the Pending Acquisition of NFP (the “Transaction”)•The Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including conditions related to regulatory approvals, and may not be completed on a timely basis, or at all, or may be completed on a basis that has a material impact on the value of the combined company. Failure to close the Transaction could negatively impact our share price and future business and financial results.•While the Transaction is pending, we are subject to business uncertainties related to our relationships with employees, clients and suppliers, which could adversely affect our business and operations. These uncertainties could also adversely affect the combined company following the Transaction. Risks Related to Being an Irish-incorporated Company•We are incorporated in Ireland, and Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the U.S. and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.•As an Irish public limited company, certain capital structure decisions regarding the Company will require the approval of shareholders, which may limit the Company’s flexibility to manage its capital structure.•The implementation of the OECD global minimum tax regime in Ireland could have a material adverse effect on our global effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.Risks Related to Our BusinessAn overall decline in economic and business activity could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of our business.The results of our operations are generally affected by the level of business activity of our clients, which in turn is affected by the economy of the industries and markets these clients serve. Economic downturns, volatility, or uncertainty in the broader economy or in specific markets (including as a result of endemics or pandemics, climate change, political unrest, actions by central banks, or otherwise) may cause reductions in technology and discretionary spending by our clients, which may result in 11reductions in the growth of new business or reductions in existing business. If our clients become financially less stable, enter bankruptcy, liquidate their operations or consolidate, our revenues and collectability of receivables could be adversely affected.The demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases, affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our Commercial Risk Solutions and Reinsurance Solutions lines. The economic activity that impacts property and casualty insurance is most closely correlated with employment levels, corporate revenues, and asset values. Downward fluctuations in the year-over-year insurance premiums charged by insurers to protect against the same risk, referred to in the industry as softening of the insurance market, could adversely affect these businesses as a significant portion of the revenue is determined as a percentage of premiums charged to our clients. In addition, certain discretionary services within our business, such as Human Capital, project-related work within Commercial Risk Solutions and Health Solutions, and transaction services, may see a decrease in activity if the overall level of economic activity results in a reduction to our clients’ discretionary spending. Insolvencies and consolidations associated with an economic downturn, especially insolvencies in the insurance industry, could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business. Also, error and omission claims against us, which we refer to as E&O claims, may increase in economic downturns, also adversely affecting our business. In addition, decreased underwriting capacity for insurance and reinsurance may create difficulty for our professionals to place business, which may adversely impact our ability to earn revenue.We face significant competitive pressures from traditional and non-traditional competitors that could affect our business. As a global professional services firm, we compete with a broad variety of firms, including global, national, regional, and local insurance companies that market and service their own products, other financial services providers, brokers, and investment managers, independent firms, and consulting organizations affiliated with accounting, information systems, technology, human resources consulting, and financial services firms. We compete with respect to service, delivery of insights, product features, price, commission structure, technology, financial strength, ability to access certain insurance markets, and name recognition. Our competitors may have better financial, technical and marketing resources, broader customer bases, greater name recognition, more comprehensive products, stronger presence in certain geographies, or more established relationships with their customers and suppliers than we have.Alliances or mergers among competitors could affect our business. Further, we compete on pricing and the innovation and quality of our service offerings, which could be affected by competitors’ lower cost structures, product development activities, and pricing policies, any or all of which could result in better market acceptance of our competitors’ offerings than those that we offer or develop. This competition is further intensified by an industry trend where clients elect to engage multiple brokers to service different portions of their accounts. If we fail to respond successfully to the evolving competition we face, our financial condition or results of operations might be adversely affected.If we are unable to effectively develop and implement innovative strategies, efficiencies and new solutions for our clients, our reputation, ability to compete effectively and financial condition may be adversely affected.Developing and implementing innovative strategies, efficient business practices, and new solutions to current and emerging client needs is important to our business. We may be unsuccessful in developing innovative strategies, or our competitors may be more successful in innovating and delivering services to meet new and existing client needs. Competitors may be able to innovate faster and respond better to evolving client demand and industry conditions, or may price their products in a manner that clients find more attractive than Aon. Further, new and non- traditional competitors, our clients’ increasing ability and determination to self-insure, and capital market alternatives to traditional insurance and reinsurance markets cause additional forms of competition and innovation that could affect our business. If we are unsuccessful in innovating, if we cannot innovate as quickly as our competitors, if we are not able to make sufficient investment in innovation, if our competitors develop more cost-effective technologies (including through the use of artificial intelligence or other emerging technologies), or if our ideas are not accepted in the marketplace, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and complete client engagements. For example, we have invested significantly in Aon Business Services and the development of proprietary data and analytics tools including repositories of global insurance and reinsurance placement information, which we use to help drive results for our clients in the insurance and reinsurance placement process. Our competitors have or are developing competing data and analytics tools, and their success in this space may impact our ability to differentiate our own data and analytics tools. Innovations in software, cloud computing, data and analytics, generative artificial intelligence, or other technologies that alter how our services are delivered could significantly undermine our investment in the business if we are slow to innovate or unable to take advantage of these developments. 12In addition, innovation in technology, capabilities, sources of capital for our clients’ insurance and reinsurance needs, and the entry into new lines of business, services, or products require significant investment and present additional risks to the Company, particularly in instances where the markets are new or not fully developed or where participants in such markets are new entrants. Such risks include the investment of significant time and resources; the possibility that these efforts will not be successful and could result in reputational damage to us; the possibility that the marketplace does not accept our products or services or that we are unable to retain clients that adopt our new products or services; and the risk of new or additional liabilities associated with these efforts, including potential E&O or other claims.If our clients are not satisfied with our services, we may face additional cost, loss of profit opportunities, damage to our reputation, or legal liability.We depend, to a large extent, on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for high-quality advice and solutions. If a client is not satisfied with our services, it could cause us to incur additional costs and impair profitability, or lose the client relationship altogether. Moreover, if we fail to meet our contractual, common law or fiduciary obligations, we could be subject to legal liability or loss of client relationships.The nature of much of our work involves assumptions and estimates concerning future events, the actual outcome of which we cannot know with certainty in advance. For example, in our investment businesses, we may be measured based on our track record regarding judgments and advice on investments that are susceptible to influences unknown at the time the advice was given. In addition, we could make computational, software programming, or data entry or management errors. A client may claim it suffered losses due to reliance on our consulting advice or reporting, which poses risks of liability exposure and costs of defense and increased insurance premiums. Many of our clients are businesses that actively share information among themselves about the quality of service they receive from their vendors. Adverse statements or claims from clients (including clients in the public sector or whose activities are frequently covered by the press) may receive media attention or other publicity. Accordingly, poor service to one client may negatively impact our relationships with multiple other clients. Damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business.We advise our clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, financial condition, and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters or others could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential clients and existing and future employees, which could make it difficult for us to attract new clients and employees and retain existing ones. Negative public opinion could also result from actual or alleged conduct by us or those currently or formerly associated with us. Damage to our reputation, including as a result of negative perceptions or publicity regarding a class of business, environmental matters, climate change, workforce make-up, pay equity, harassment, social justice, cyber security or data privacy, or our inability to meet commitments or client and stakeholder expectations with respect to such matters, could affect the confidence of our clients, rating agencies, regulators, stockholders, employees and third parties in transactions that are important to our business adversely affecting our business, financial condition, and operating results.Revenues from commission arrangements may fluctuate due to many factors, including cyclical or permanent changes in the insurance and reinsurance markets outside of our control.Revenues from commission arrangements have historically been affected by significant fluctuations arising from uncertainties and changes in the industries in which we operate. A significant portion of our revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage. We have no control over premium rates, and our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction. The potential for changes in premium rates is significant, due to pricing cyclicality in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets.In addition to movements in premium rates, our ability to generate premium-based commission revenue may be challenged by:•the growing availability of alternative methods for clients to meet their risk-protection needs, including a greater willingness on the part of corporations to “self-insure,” the use of so-called “captive” insurers, and the development of capital markets-based solutions and other alternative capital sources for traditional insurance and reinsurance needs that increase market capacity, increase competition, and put pressure on premiums;•decreases in available underwriting capacity for insurance and reinsurance;•fluctuation in the need for, or relevancy of, insurance;•the level of compensation, as a percentage of premium, that insurance carriers are willing to compensate brokers for placement activity;13•the growing desire of clients to move away from variable commission rates and instead compensate brokers based upon flat fees, which can negatively impact us as fees are not consistently indexed for inflation and may not rise as much as commission-based compensation;•competition from insurers seeking to sell their products directly to consumers, including online sales, without the involvement of an insurance broker; and•the growing number of technology-enabled competitors offering new risk-transfer solutions that eliminate the traditional broker-client relationship in both commercial insurance and reinsurance markets.The profitability of our operations may not meet our expectations due to unexpected costs, cost overruns, inflation, early contract terminations, unrealized assumptions used in our contract bidding process or the inability to maintain our prices.Our profitability is highly dependent upon our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency. As we adapt to changes in our business and the market, adapt to the regulatory environment, enter into new engagements, acquire additional businesses, and take on new employees in new locations, we may not be able to manage our large, diverse and changing workforce, effectively control our costs, or improve our efficiency.Our profit margin, and therefore our profitability, is largely a function of the revenue generated from our services and the staffing costs for our personnel and related expenses. Accordingly, if we are not able to maintain the rates we charge for our services or appropriately manage the staffing costs of our personnel and related expenses, we may not be able to sustain our profit margin and our profitability will suffer. The prices we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors, including competitive factors, the extent of ongoing clients’ perception of our ability to add value through our services, and general economic conditions. If we cannot drive suitable cost efficiencies, our profit margins will suffer. Our cost efficiencies may also be impacted by factors such as our ability to transition consultants from completed projects to new assignments, our ability to secure new business, our ability to forecast demand for our services (and, consequently, appropriately manage the size and location of our workforce), our ability to develop, attract and retain suitable capabilities and talent, our ability to obtain third party services at favorable prices, our ability to manage key suppliers to maximize delivery, product and efficiency opportunities, inflation (including wage inflation) and the need to devote time and resources to training and professional and business development.In our investment businesses, we advise or act on behalf of clients regarding their investments. The results of these investments are uncertain and subject to numerous factors, some of which are within our control and some which are not. Clients that experience losses or lower than expected investment returns may leave us for competitors and/or assert claims against us.Our investment businesses provide advice to clients on: investment strategy, which can include advice on setting investment objectives, asset allocation, and hedging strategies; selection (or removal) of investment managers; the investment in different investment instruments and products; and the selection of other investment service providers such as custodians and transition managers. For some clients, we are responsible for making decisions on these matters and we may implement such decisions in a fiduciary or agency capacity without assuming title over the underlying funds or assets invested. Asset classes may experience poor absolute performance and third parties we recommend or select, such as investment managers, may underperform their benchmarks due to poor market performance, negligence, or other reasons, resulting in poor investment returns or losses. These losses may be attributable in whole or in part to alleged failures on our part or to events entirely outside of our control, including but not limited to uncertainty or volatility in financial markets due to economic, political, and regulatory conditions or pandemics. Plaintiffs have filed, and may continue to file, individual and class action lawsuits alleging investment consultants have charged excessive fees, given improper advice or taken investment actions due to conflicts of interest, or recommended investments that underperformed other investments available at the time. Defending against these claims can involve potentially significant costs, including legal defense costs, as well as cause substantial distraction, publicity and diversion of other resources. If any lawsuit – against the Company or any other investment consultant or asset manager – results in a large adverse verdict, the size of the verdict or resultant negative adverse publicity may prompt the filing of additional lawsuits. Furthermore, our ability to limit our potential liability is restricted in certain jurisdictions and in connection with claims involving breaches of fiduciary or agency duties or other alleged errors or omissions.Financial RisksWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows.We face exposure to adverse movements in exchange rates of currencies other than our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, as a significant portion of our business is located outside of the U.S. These exposures may change over time, and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. Approximately 55% of our consolidated revenue is non-U.S., attributed on the basis of where the services are performed, and where products are sold, and the exposures created can have significant currency volatility. These currency exchange fluctuations create risk in both the translation of the financial 14results of our global subsidiaries into U.S. dollars for our consolidated financial statements, as well as in those of our operations that receive revenue and incur expenses other than in their respective local currencies, which can reduce the profitability of our operations based on the direction the respective currencies’ exchange rates move. A decrease in the value of certain currencies relative to other currencies could place us at a relative disadvantage compared to our competitors that benefit to a greater degree from a specific exchange rate move and can, as a result, deliver services at a lower cost or receive greater revenues from such a transaction. Although we use various derivative financial instruments to limit the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, we cannot eliminate such risks, and, as a result, changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results. For example, the strengthening of the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies might adversely affect the value of our products and services when translated to U.S. dollar, even if the value of such products and services has not changed in their original currency.Changes in interest rates and deterioration of credit quality could reduce the value of our cash balances and investment portfolios and adversely affect our financial condition or results.Operating funds available for corporate use were $1,147 million at December 31, 2023 and are reported in Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments. Of the total balance, $120 million was restricted to its use as of December 31, 2023. Funds held on behalf of clients and insurers were $6.9 billion at December 31, 2023 and are reported in Fiduciary assets. We also carry an investment portfolio of other long-term investments. As of December 31, 2023, these long-term investments had a carrying value of $45 million. Adverse changes in interest rates, performance, and counterparty credit quality, including default, could reduce the value of these funds and investments, thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results. We may experience reduced investment earnings on our cash and short-term investments of fiduciary and operating funds if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk fall below their current levels, or if negative yields on deposits or investments are experienced, as we have experienced in Japan and certain jurisdictions in the E.U. On the other hand, higher interest rates could result in a higher discount rate used by investors to value our future cash flows thereby resulting in a lower valuation of the Company. In addition, during times of stress in the banking industry, counterparty risk can quickly escalate, potentially resulting in substantial losses for us as a result of our cash or other investments with such counterparties, as well as substantial losses for our clients and the insurance companies with which we work.Our pension obligations and value of our pension assets could adversely affect our shareholders’ equity, net income, cash flow, and liquidity.To the extent that the pension obligations associated with our pension plans continue to exceed the fair value of the assets supporting those obligations, our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected. In particular, lower interest rates and investment returns could result in the present value of plan liabilities increasing at a greater rate than the value of plan assets, resulting in higher unfunded positions in our pension plans. In addition, the periodic revision of pension assumptions or variances of actual results from our assumptions can materially change the present value of expected future benefits, and therefore the funded status of the plans and resulting net periodic pension expense. As a result, we may experience future changes in the funded status of our plans that could require us to make additional cash contributions beyond those that have been estimated and which could adversely affect shareholders’ equity, net income, cash flow and liquidity.Our worldwide pension plans are significant, and therefore our pension contributions and expense are sensitive to various market, demographic, and other factors. These factors include equity and bond market returns, fair value of pension assets, the assumed interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities, foreign exchange rates, rates of inflation, mortality assumptions, potential regulatory and legal changes or developments, and counterparty exposure from various investments and derivative contracts, including annuities. Variations or developments in connection with any of these factors could cause significant changes to our financial position and results of operations from year to year. In addition, contributions are generally based on statutory requirements and local funding practices, which may differ from measurements under U.S. GAAP.We have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility.As of December 31, 2023, we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately $11.2 billion. The level of debt outstanding could adversely affect our financial flexibility by reducing our ability to use cash from operations for other purposes, including working capital, dividends to shareholders, share repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. We also are subject to risks that, at the time any of our outstanding debt matures, we will not be able to retire or refinance the debt on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.As of December 31, 2023, we had two committed credit facilities outstanding. Each of these facilities is intended to support our commercial paper obligations and our general working capital needs. In addition, each of these facilities included customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios of adjusted consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense and consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated EBITDA, tested quarterly.15A substantial portion of our outstanding debt, including certain intercompany debt obligations, contains financial and other covenants. The terms of these covenants may limit our ability to obtain, or increase the costs of obtaining, additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or general corporate requirements. This in turn may have the impact of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, thereby placing us at a relative disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness, or fewer or less onerous covenants associated with such indebtedness, and making us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions.If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity, or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments, and alliances, any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business. Additionally, we may not be able to take such actions or refinance any of our debt, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.A decline in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper may adversely affect our borrowing costs, access to capital, and financial flexibility.A downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper could increase our borrowing costs, reduce or eliminate our access to capital, reduce our financial flexibility, and limit our ability to implement our corporate strategy. Our senior debt ratings at December 31, 2023 were A- with a negative outlook (S&P), BBB+ with a negative outlook (Fitch), and Baa2 with a stable outlook (Moody’s). Our commercial paper ratings were A-2 (S&P), F-2 (Fitch) and P-2 (Moody’s).Real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect any trading market for, or trading value of, our securities. Such changes could result from any number of factors, including the modification by a credit rating agency of the criteria or methodology it applies to particular issuers, a change in the agency’s view of us or our industry, or as a consequence of actions we take to implement our corporate strategies. A change in our credit rating could adversely affect our access to capital and our competitive position.Our tax assets and liabilities are subject to a variety of different factors, which could create volatility in our global effective tax rate, expose us to greater than anticipated tax liabilities or cause us to adjust previously recognized tax assets and liabilities.We are, and anticipate we will be, subject to income taxes in Ireland, the U.K., the U.S. and many other jurisdictions. As a result, our global effective tax rate from period to period can be affected by many factors, including changes in tax legislation or regulations, the continuing development of regulations and other governmental action that affect the application of such legislation, our global mix of earnings, the use of global funding structures, the tax characteristics of our income, the effect of complying with transfer pricing requirements under laws of many different countries on our revenues and costs, the consequences of acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and business segments. In addition, we could be subject to increased taxation as a result of changes in eligibility for the benefits of current income tax treaties between and among Ireland, the U.K., the U.S and other countries, including any future amendments to the current income tax treaties between and among such countries, or any new statutory or regulatory provisions that might limit our ability to take advantage of any such treaties. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes, and our determination of the amount of our tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities. Our actual global tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material.The overall tax environment in the jurisdictions in which we are or may be subject to taxes is highly uncertain and increasingly complex. In the U.S., the Inflation Reduction Act introduced, among other changes, a 1% excise tax on certain stock redemptions by U.S. corporations (which the U.S. Treasury indicated may also apply to certain stock redemptions of foreign corporations deemed funded by their U.S. affiliates). The OECD, a global coalition of member countries, proposed a plan (commonly referred to as “Pillar Two”) to reform international taxation which includes the introduction of a 15% global minimum tax on book income with specified adjustments and determined on a country-by-country basis. The OECD proposed tax regime has been nominally accepted by many countries within and without the OECD, although implementation in each country remains subject to the possibility of significant variation, which could lead to a risk of multiple levels of taxation on Aon’s income. Ireland, the U.K. and many E.U. member states, among others, have enacted legislation to implement the global minimum tax that are consistent with the OECD proposed tax regime. Under Ireland’s Pillar Two tax regime, starting in 2024, Aon’s net income (under U.S. GAAP), with specified modifications and determined on country-by-country basis, will be subject to the 15% minimum tax. There remains significant uncertainty, however, as to how Ireland’s Pillar Two tax regime and the OECD’s past and potentially future Pillar Two guidance will ultimately apply to Aon. In any event, until further clarifications are provided, there is a risk that the global minimum tax regime could have a material adverse effect on our global effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.16We are, and anticipate we will be, subject to tax audits conducted by Ireland, the U.K., the U.S., and other tax authorities, and the resolution of such audits could impact our tax rate in future periods, as would any reclassification or other changes (such as those in applicable accounting rules) that increases the amounts we have provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements. The tax laws and regulations in Ireland, the U.K., the U.S., and the other tax jurisdictions in which we operate are inherently complex, and we will be obligated to make judgments and interpretations about the application of these laws and regulations to our operations and businesses. The interpretation and application of these laws and regulations could be challenged by the relevant governmental authorities, which could result in administrative or judicial procedures, actions or sanctions, which could be material. There can be no assurance that we would be successful in attempting to mitigate the adverse impacts resulting from any changes in tax laws and regulations, including any changes in the interpretation of such tax authorities, or from audits and other matters. Our inability to mitigate the negative consequences of such actions could cause our global effective tax rate to increase, our use of cash to increase and our financial condition and results of operations to suffer.Changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements. We are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, those relating to revenue recognition, pensions, recoverability of assets including customer receivables, valuation of goodwill and intangibles, contingencies, share-based payments, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances. These assumptions and estimates involve the exercise of judgment and discretion, which may evolve over time in light of operational experience, regulatory direction, developments or changes in accounting principles or standards, and other factors. Actual results could differ from these estimates, or changes in assumptions, estimates, policies, or developments in the business may change our initial estimates, which could materially affect the Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Financial Position, Shareholders’ Equity, and Cash Flows.We may be required to record goodwill or other long-lived asset impairment charges, which could result in a significant charge to earnings.Under U.S. GAAP, we review our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or other long-lived assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our share price or market capitalization, reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry. We may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or other long- lived assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and other long-lived assets. Future goodwill or other long-lived asset impairment charges could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.We are a holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends or other payments in needed amounts from our subsidiaries.The Company is organized as a holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating entities. As a holding company without significant operations of its own, our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our subsidiaries. We rely on dividends, interest, and other payments from these subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt, paying dividends to shareholders, repurchasing ordinary shares, and corporate expenses. Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate or other restrictions that may limit the amounts that subsidiaries can pay in dividends or other payments to us. No assurance can be given that there will not be further changes in law, regulatory actions, or other circumstances that could restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise make payments to us. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that our subsidiaries may be able to make timely payments to us in order for us to meet our obligations.Legal and Regulatory RisksWe are subject to E&O claims against us as well as other contingencies and legal proceedings, some of which, if determined unfavorably to us, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.We assist our clients with various matters, including advising on and placing insurance and reinsurance coverage and handling related claims, consulting on various human resources matters, and providing actuarial, investment consulting, and asset management services. E&O claims against us may allege our potential liability for damages arising from these services. 17E&O claims could include, for example, the failure of our employees or sub-agents, whether negligently or intentionally, to place coverage correctly or notify carriers of claims on behalf of clients, to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured, or the failure to give error-free consulting or investment advice. It is not always possible to prevent and detect E&Os, and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases. In addition, we are subject to other types of claims, litigation, and proceedings in the ordinary course of business, which along with E&O claims, may seek damages, including punitive damages, in amounts that could, if awarded, have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, earnings, and cash flows. In addition to potential liability for monetary damages, such claims or outcomes could harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business.We have historically purchased, and intend to continue to purchase, insurance to cover E&O claims and other insurance to provide protection against certain losses that arise in such matters and other matters related to our operations. However, we may be unable to maintain, at commercially reasonable rates, our current levels of insurance coverage for E&O claims or other risks in future periods, and with respect to such periods may seek to utilize self-insurance programs such as captives, the funding of which may not adequately cover the costs of potential losses. Also, we have exhausted or materially depleted our coverage under some of the policies that protect us for certain years and, consequently, are self-insured or materially self-insured for some historical claims. Additionally, parts or all of an E&O claim could fall within insurance deductibles, self-insured retentions, or policy exclusions. Accruals for these exposures, and related insurance receivables, when applicable, have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable. These accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as developments warrant and may also be adversely affected by disputes we may have with our insurers over coverage. Amounts related to settlement provisions are recorded in Other general expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Discussion of some of these claims, lawsuits, and proceedings are contained in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.In addition, we provide a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to our customers and others. In the event of a default, our potential exposure is equal to the amount of the guarantee or indemnification.The ultimate outcome of claims, lawsuits, proceedings, guarantees and indemnifications cannot be ascertained, and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us. It is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters.Our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which could reduce our profitability, limit our growth, or subject us to legal and regulatory actions.Our businesses are subject to extensive legal and regulatory oversight throughout the world, including the Irish Companies Act, the U.S. securities laws, rules, and regulations, the rules and regulations promulgated by the FCA and a variety of other laws, rules, and regulations addressing, among other things, licensing, privacy and data protection, trade sanctions laws, restrictions and export controls, anti-money laundering, wage-and-hour standards, employment and labor relations, antitrust and competition, anti-corruption, currency, reserves, government contracting, and the amount of local investment with respect to our operations in certain countries. This legal and regulatory oversight could reduce our profitability or limit our growth by: increasing the costs of legal and regulatory compliance; limiting or restricting the products or services we sell, the markets we serve or enter, the methods by which we sell our products and services, the overall structure of our business units, the type of services and prices we can charge for our services, or the form of compensation we can accept from our clients, carriers, and third parties; or by subjecting our businesses to the possibility of legal and regulatory actions, proceedings, or fines.The global nature of our operations increases the complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations adding to our cost of doing business. In addition, many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions, increasing the complexity and cost of compliance. In emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less developed legal systems, local laws and regulations may not be established with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us adequate assurance that we are operating our business in a compliant manner with all required licenses or that our rights are otherwise protected. In addition, certain laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance provisions of the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act in the U.S., and the Bribery Act of 2010 in the U.K., impact our operations outside of the legislating country by imposing requirements for the conduct of overseas operations, and in several cases, requiring compliance by foreign subsidiaries.In addition to the complexity of the laws and regulations themselves, the development of new laws and regulations or changes in application or interpretation of current laws and regulations or conflict between them also increases our legal and regulatory compliance complexity. Additionally, our acquisitions of new businesses and our continued operational changes and entry into new jurisdictions and development of new service offerings increases our legal and regulatory compliance complexity, as well as the type of governmental oversight to which we may be subject. Changes in laws and regulations could mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions, impose additional licensure requirements or costs to our operations and services, or cause us to cease offering certain services or solutions. Furthermore, as 18we enter new jurisdictions or businesses and further develop and expand our services, including through acquisitions, we may become subject to additional types of laws and governmental oversight and supervision, such as those applicable to the financial lending or other service institutions. Regulatory developments that could result in changes that adversely affect us or cause us to change our business or operations include: additional requirements respecting data privacy, data security, and data usage in jurisdictions in which we operate that may increase our costs of compliance and potentially reduce the manner in which we can use data; changes in tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate; regulatory actions or changes that require us to change our compensation model; or additional regulations promulgated by, regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which we operate.Governmental and public attention to climate change and environmental matters, including new or enhanced reporting, diligence or disclosure rules and regulations, could expand the nature, scope, and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess, and report. These and other rapidly changing laws, rules and regulations, may increase the cost of our compliance and risk management and otherwise impact our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, the shift toward a lower-carbon economy, driven by changes in laws, rules and regulations, low-carbon technology advancement, consumer sentiment, and/or liability risks, may negatively impact our business model and/or the business models of our clients. In addition, as governments, investors and other stakeholders face additional pressures to accelerate actions to address climate change and other ESG topics, governments and other stakeholders may impose new rules or expectations causing a shift in disclosure and other behaviors that may negatively impact our business.In all jurisdictions, the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities. Generally, such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant, renew, and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations. Accordingly, we may have a license revoked or be unable to obtain new licenses and therefore be precluded or suspended from carrying on or developing some or all of our activities or otherwise be fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction. No assurances can be given that our business can further develop or continue to be conducted in any given jurisdiction in the future as it has been conducted in the past. Changes in the regulatory scheme, or even changes in how applicable regulations are interpreted, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations by limiting revenue streams or increasing costs of compliance. Our business’ regulatory oversight also includes licensing of insurance brokers and agents, managing general agency or general underwriting operations, and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Our continuing ability to provide insurance broking in the jurisdictions in which we operate depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions, and our failure to adhere to these rules and regulations can expose us to fines or other sanctions. Also, we can be affected indirectly by the governmental regulation and supervision of insurance companies. For instance, if we are providing or managing general underwriting services for an insurer, we may have to adhere to regulations affecting our insurer client.Services provided in our Health Solutions and Wealth Solutions businesses are also the subject of ever-evolving government regulation, either because the services provided to our clients are regulated directly or because third parties upon whom we rely to provide services to clients are regulated, thereby indirectly affecting the manner in which we provide services to those clients. In particular, our health care exchange business depends upon the private sector of the U.S. insurance system and its role in financing health care delivery, and insurance carriers’ use and payment of commissions to agents, brokers, and other organizations to market and sell individual and family health insurance products and plans. Uncertainty regarding, or any changes to, state or federal law, or the interpretation of such law by applicable regulatory agencies could delay client adoption of our health care exchanges, impair our ability to retain clients who have adopted our health care exchanges, or cause insurance carriers to alter or eliminate the products and plans that they offer or attempt to move members into new products or plans for which we receive lower commissions. In addition, changes in laws, government regulations, or the way those regulations are interpreted in the jurisdictions in which we operate could affect the viability, value, use, or delivery of benefits and human resources programs, including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans (such as medical), defined contribution plans (such as 401(k)), or defined benefit plans (such as pension), may adversely affect the demand for, or profitability of, our services.If we violate the laws and regulations to which we are subject, we could be subject to fines, penalties, or criminal sanctions and could be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate these laws and regulations, causing an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.Heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny may lead to additional regulatory investigations, increased government involvement, or enforcement actions, which could consume significant management time and resources and could have adverse effects on our business and operations. For instance, increased scrutiny by competition authorities may increase our costs of 19doing business or force us to change the way we conduct business or refrain from or otherwise alter the way we engage in certain activities. Additionally, we could suffer significant financial or reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest, which exist or could exist any time we or any of our employees have or may have an interest in a transaction or engagement that is inconsistent with our clients’ interests. This could occur, for example, when we are providing services to multiple parties in connection with a transaction. We also may provide multiple types of services to certain clients from more than one of our solution lines, creating a greater potential for conflicts with advisory services.Due to the broad scope of our businesses and our client base, we regularly address potential conflicts of interest, including, without limitation, situations where our services to a particular client or our own investments or other interests conflict, or are perceived to conflict, with the interests of another client. If these are not adequately identified and managed, this could then lead to failure or perceived failure to protect the client’s interests, with consequential regulatory and reputational risks, including litigation or enforcement actions that could adversely affect us and our operations. Identifying conflicts of interest may also prove particularly difficult as we continue to bring systems and information together and integrate newly acquired businesses. In addition, we may not be able to adequately address such conflicts of interest.Insurance intermediaries have traditionally been remunerated by base commissions paid by insurance carriers in respect of insurance placements for clients, or by fees paid by clients. Intermediaries also obtain other revenue from insurance carriers. This revenue, when derived from carriers in their capacity as insurance markets (as opposed to as corporate clients of the intermediaries where they may be purchasing insurance or reinsurance or other non-market related services), is commonly known as MDI. MDI is another example of an area in which potential conflicts of interest may arise. This revenue may be subject to scrutiny by various regulators under conflict of interest, anti-trust, unfair competition, conduct and anti-bribery laws and regulations. MDI takes a variety of forms, including volume- or profit-based contingent commissions, facilities administration charges, business development agreements, and fees for providing consulting services to carriers. While accepting MDI is a lawful and acceptable business practice, we cannot predict whether our position will result in regulatory or other scrutiny and our controls may not be fully effective. Failure to protect our intellectual property rights, or allegations that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others, could harm our reputation, ability to compete effectively, and financial condition.To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on a combination of trademark laws, copyright laws, patent laws, trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements, and other contractual arrangements with our affiliates, employees, clients, strategic partners, and others, as well as internal policies and procedures regarding our management of intellectual property. However, the protective steps that we take may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Further, we operate in many jurisdictions and effective trademark, copyright, patent, and trade secret protection may not be available or adequate in every country or jurisdiction in which we offer our services or employ our colleagues. Additionally, our competitors may develop products similar to our products that do not infringe our intellectual property rights. Failure to protect our intellectual property adequately could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively.In addition, to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, we may initiate litigation against third parties, such as infringement suits or interference proceedings. Third parties may assert intellectual property rights claims against us, which may be costly to defend, could require the payment of damages, and could limit our ability to use or offer certain technologies, products, or other intellectual property. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be expensive, take significant time and divert management’s attention from other business concerns. Successful challenges against us could require us to modify or discontinue our use of technology or business processes where such use is found to infringe or violate the rights of others, or require us to purchase licenses from third parties, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.Operational RisksThe economic and political conditions of the countries and regions in which we operate could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity, and prospects for growth.Our operations in countries undergoing political change or experiencing economic instability are subject to uncertainty and risks that could materially adversely affect our business. These risks include, particularly in emerging markets, the possibility we would be subject to undeveloped or evolving legal systems, unstable governments and economies, impacts from geopolitical conflicts, and potential governmental actions affecting the flow of goods, services, and currency. We may not realize all of the expected benefits from our restructuring plan and other operational improvement initiatives.In 2023, we initiated a three-year restructuring program, Accelerating Aon United Program (the “Program”). The Program is intended to streamline our technology infrastructure, optimize our leadership structure and resource alignment, and reduce 20our real estate footprint to align to our hybrid working strategy. The Program will include technology-related costs to facilitate streamlining and simplifying operations, headcount reduction costs, and costs associated with asset impairments, including real estate consolidation costs. The Program is currently expected to result in cumulative costs of approximately $1,000 million, consisting of approximately $900 million of cash charges and approximately $100 million of non-cash charges.We estimate that our annualized savings from the Program will be approximately $350 million by the end of 2026. Actual total costs, savings and timing may vary from these estimates due to changes in the scope or assumptions underlying the Program and other operational improvement initiatives. We therefore cannot assure that we will achieve the targeted savings. Unanticipated costs or unrealized savings in connection with the Program and other operational improvement initiatives could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.Our success depends on our ability to retain, attract and develop experienced and qualified personnel, including our senior management team and other personnel.We depend, in material part, upon the members of our senior management team who possess extensive knowledge and a deep understanding of our business and our strategy, as well as the colleagues who are critical to developing and retaining client relationships. The unexpected loss of services of any of these senior leaders could have a disruptive effect adversely impacting our ability to manage our business effectively and execute our business strategy. Additionally, competition for professional personnel remains intense, and we are constantly working to retain, attract and develop these professionals. If we cannot successfully do so, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. We may also become involved in disputes and litigation in connection with our efforts to retain and hire personnel, which can be disruptive to our business and may expose us to potential liability for monetary damages. While we have plans for key management succession and long-term compensation plans designed to retain our senior management team and critical colleagues, if our succession plans and retention programs do not operate effectively, our business could be adversely affected. We strive to maintain an equitable work environment that unlocks the full potential of all of our personnel - this includes our commitment to inclusion, focus on colleague wellness and mental health and belonging, and building a flexible work environment that meets colleague and client needs. If we are unsuccessful in maintaining such a work environment or adapting to colleague needs or expectations, we could experience difficulty attracting and retaining personnel, which could have a negative impact on our business.Our global operations expose us to various international risks that could adversely affect our business.Our operations are conducted globally. Accordingly, we are subject to regulatory, legal, economic, and market risks associated with global operations and sourcing, including:•difficulties in staffing and managing our offices, and overseeing joint venture operations and compliance in disparate jurisdictions, including due to unexpected inflation (including wage inflation) or job turnover, and the increased travel, infrastructure, and legal and compliance costs and risks associated with multiple international locations;•hyperinflation in certain countries;•the impacts of geopolitical conflicts;•conflicting regulations across the countries in which we do business;•imposition of investment requirements or other restrictions by governments in certain countries;•longer payment cycles;•greater difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;•insufficient demand for our services in certain jurisdictions;•our ability to execute effective and efficient cross-border sourcing of services on behalf of our clients;•the reliance on or use of third parties to perform services on behalf of the Company;•disparate tax regimes;•restrictions on the import and export of technologies; and•trade barriers.Our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to develop, implement, update, and enhance solutions to support our business operations or if we are not able to effectively drive value for our clients. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to enhance and implement the systems necessary to operate our businesses and to achieve intended efficiencies and improvements. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to rapid and continuing changes in technology, data and analytics, industry standards and client preferences. The effort to gain necessary expertise and achieve internal efficiencies through technology and data and analytics requires us to incur significant expenses, and we may not be successful in identifying the optimal funding priorities. We make investments in technology and data and 21analytics to operate our businesses and achieve intended efficiencies; however, our investments and enhancements may not be sufficient to respond to needs across all of our businesses. In addition, if we are not successful in developing and maintaining expertise in process excellence, technology and data trends, our business performance may be compromised.The occurrence of natural or man-made disasters could result in declines in business and increases in claims that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We are exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes, extreme weather, or other climate events; pandemic health events (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), and man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism, civil unrest, violence, military actions, and cyber-terrorism (including, but not limited to, ransomware). The continued threat of terrorism and other events or disasters may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, and a natural or man-made disaster could trigger energy shortages, public health issues, or an economic downturn or instability in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster. These consequences could, among other things, result in a decline in business and increased claims from those areas. They could also result in reduced underwriting capacity, making it more difficult for our professionals to place business. Disasters also could disrupt public and private infrastructure, including communications and financial services, which could disrupt our normal business operations and negatively impact the abilities of our counterparties to pay for our services on time or at all. If access to underwriting markets for certain lines of coverage becomes unavailable or difficult due to the impact of climate change on the claims environment, this may have a negative impact on our clients’ access to coverage, which could in turn reduce our ability to place certain lines of coverage and negatively impact our business.A natural or man-made disaster also could disrupt the operations of our counterparties or result in increased prices for the products and services they provide to us. In addition, a disaster could adversely affect the value of the assets in our investment portfolio. Finally, a natural or man-made disaster could increase the incidence or severity of E&O claims against us. Climate change may increase the likelihood or severity of a natural or man-made disaster.Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, or legal liability.Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our personnel, offices, and technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations. Should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as a security incident or attack, a natural disaster, climate event, terrorist attack, pandemic, power loss, telecommunications failure, or other natural or man-made disaster, our continued success will depend, in part, on the availability of our personnel and office facilities, and the proper functioning of computer systems, telecommunications, and other related systems and operations. In events like these, while our operational size, the multiple locations from which we operate, and our existing back-up systems provide us with some degree of flexibility, we still can experience near-term operational challenges in particular areas of our operations. We could potentially lose access to key executives, personnel, or client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario. A disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions, or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships, or legal liability.We rely on third parties to perform key functions of our business operations enabling our provision of services to our clients. These third parties may act in ways that could harm our business.We rely on third parties, and in some cases subcontractors, to provide services, data, and information such as technology, information security, funds transfers, data processing, support functions, and administration that are critical to the operations of our business. These third parties include correspondents, agents and other brokerage and intermediaries, insurance markets, data providers, plan trustees, payroll service providers, benefits administrators, software and system vendors, business process outsourcing providers, health plan providers, investment managers, and providers of human resources, among others. As we do not fully control the actions of these third parties, we are subject to the risk that their decisions, actions, or inactions may adversely impact us and replacing these service providers could create significant delay and expense. Our failure to manage our key suppliers and our day-to-day operations with effective controls, and/or a failure by third parties to comply with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements in a high quality and timely manner, particularly during periods of our peak demand for their services, could result in economic, legal, and reputational harm to us. In addition, we face risks as we transition from in-house functions to third- party support functions and providers that there may be disruptions in service or other unintended results that may adversely affect our business operations. These third parties face their own technology, operating, business, and economic risks, and any significant failures by them, including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client, employee, or company information, could cause harm to our business and reputation. An interruption in or the cessation of service by any service provider as a result of systems failures, cybersecurity or data privacy incidents 22(including, but not limited to, ransomware), capacity constraints, financial difficulties, or for any other reason could disrupt our operations, impact our ability to offer certain products and services, and result in contractual or regulatory penalties, liability claims from clients, or employees, damage to our reputation, and harm to our business.Our business is exposed to risks associated with the handling of client funds.Certain of our businesses collect premiums from insureds and remit the premiums to the respective insurers. We also collect claims or refunds from insurers on behalf of insureds, which are then remitted to the insureds. Consequently, at any given time, we may be holding and managing funds of our clients. This function creates a risk of loss arising from, among other things, fraud by employees or third parties, execution of unauthorized transactions, errors relating to transaction processing, or other cybersecurity events or security breaches. We are also potentially at risk in the event the financial institution in which we hold these funds suffers any kind of insolvency or liquidity event. The occurrence of any of these types of events in connection with this function could cause us financial loss and reputational harm.In connection with the implementation of our corporate strategies and initiatives, we face risks associated with, among others, the acquisition or disposition of businesses, the integration and development of acquired businesses, and the entry into new lines of business or products.In pursuing our corporate strategy, we often acquire other businesses or dispose of or exit businesses we currently own and we routinely are actively engaged in the process of identifying, analyzing, and negotiating possible transactions. The success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate acquisition and disposition targets, negotiate transactions on favorable terms, secure regulatory approval of transactions where required, complete transactions and, in the case of acquisitions, successfully integrate them into our existing businesses and culture. If we are unable to identify appropriate acquisition targets, or if our competitors are more successful in identifying acquisition targets at favorable valuations, we may we fail to achieve desired strategic goals, capabilities and efficiencies, and our results of operations might be adversely affected. If a proposed transaction is not consummated, the time and resources spent pursuing it could adversely impact employees, clients and shareholders and the failure to consummate a proposed transaction could result in payment of termination fees and reimbursement of expenses, reputational harm, disputes and litigation and missed opportunities to locate and acquire other businesses. If acquisitions are made, there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, including, but not limited to, revenue growth, operational efficiencies, or expected synergies, and we could incur unexpected costs in connection with integration. If we dispose of or otherwise exit certain businesses, there can be no assurance that we will not incur certain disposition related charges, will not be subject to post-closing liabilities, obligations or restrictions, will be able to reduce overhead related to the divested assets, or will realize the intended benefits of the disposition.We may enter new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business either through acquisitions or through initiative to generate organic revenue growth. These new lines of business, products, and services may present the Company with additional risks, particularly in instances where the markets are new or not fully developed or where participants in such markets are new entrants. Such risks include the investment of significant time and resources; the possibility that these efforts will not be successful and could result in reputational damage to us; the possibility that the marketplace does not accept our products or services or that we are unable to retain clients that adopt our new products or services; and the risk of new or additional liabilities associated with these efforts, including potential E&O or other claims. In addition, many of the businesses that we acquire and develop will likely have significantly smaller scales of operations prior to the implementation of our growth strategy. If we are not able to manage the growing complexity of these businesses, including improving, refining, or revising our systems and operational practices, and enlarging the scale and scope of the businesses, our business may be adversely affected. Other risks include developing knowledge of and experience in the new business, product or service, integrating the acquired business into our systems and culture, recruiting and retaining experienced professionals, and developing and capitalizing on new relationships with experienced market participants. External factors, such as compliance with new or revised regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business, products, or services. Failure to manage these risks in the acquisition or development of new businesses could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Risks Related to Technology, Cybersecurity, and Data ProtectionWe rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business. Any significant system or network disruption due to a breach in the security of our information technology systems could have a negative impact on our reputation, operations, sales, and operating results.We rely on the efficient, uninterrupted, and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks, some of which are within the Company and some of which are outsourced to third parties. All information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including but not limited to cyber-attacks, 23computer viruses, security breaches, and unauthorized access or improper actions by insiders or employees. We are at risk of attack by a growing list of adversaries through new and increasingly sophisticated methods of attack, including methods that take advantage of remote work scenarios. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently (including as a result of the use of generative artificial intelligence, such as deepfakes), we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, implement adequate preventative measures, or detect and respond quickly enough in the event of an incident or attack. We regularly experience social engineering attempts, and increasingly sophisticated attempted attacks to our systems and networks, certain of which have been successful and have resulted in unauthorized access to our systems and data. Aon has from time to time experienced cybersecurity incidents, such as computer viruses, unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems, ransomware incidents, data loss via malicious and non-malicious methods, and similar incidents, which to date have not had a material impact on our business. If we are unable to efficiently and effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards, we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access. Aon has from time-to-time experienced and may experience in the future problems with the information technology systems of vendors, including breakdowns or other disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, difficulties in the migration of services or data to third parties or the cloud hosted by third parties, cyber-attacks, and security breaches could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to customers and otherwise conduct business. Additionally, we are a global and acquisitive organization and we therefore might not adequately identify weaknesses in certain of our information systems, including those of targets we acquire, which could expose us to unexpected liabilities and fines or make our own systems more vulnerable to attack. These types of incidents affecting us, our clients, insurance carriers, vendors, or other third-parties could result in intellectual property or other confidential information being lost or stolen, including client or employee personal information or company data.We have implemented various measures to manage our risks related to system and network security and disruptions, but a security breach or a significant or extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems could damage our reputation, cause us to lose clients, adversely impact our operations, sales, and operating results, and require us to incur significant expense (in connection with incident response, remediation efforts, or otherwise) and divert resources to address and remediate or otherwise resolve such issues. Additionally, in order to maintain the level of security, service, and reliability that our clients require, we may be required to make significant additional investments in our information technology system.Improper disclosure of confidential, personal, or proprietary data could result in regulatory scrutiny, legal liability, or harm to our reputation.One of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our employees’ and clients’ confidential and proprietary information, including confidential information about our clients’ and employees’ compensation, medical information, and other personally identifiable information. We maintain policies, procedures, and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information. Nonetheless, we have experienced cyber incidents and cannot eliminate the risk of human error, employee or vendor malfeasance, or cyber-attacks that could result in improper access to or disclosure of confidential, personal, or proprietary information. Such access or disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws and regulations that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs, fines, loss of revenue, and loss of clients. The release of confidential information as a result of a security breach could also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals or business partners, or by regulators, and the outcome of such proceedings, which could include penalties or fines, could have a significant negative impact on our business.In many jurisdictions, including in the E.U. and the U.S., we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the collection, use, retention, security, and transfer of this information. These laws and regulations are frequently changing and are becoming increasingly complex and sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services both in terms of substance and in terms of enforceability. This makes compliance challenging and expensive. Additionally, certain jurisdictions’ regulations include notice provisions that may require us to inform affected clients or employees in the event of a breach of confidential information before we fully understand or appreciate the extent of the breach. These notice provisions present operational challenges and related risk. In particular, there have been a number of recently adopted privacy laws around the globe including in China and, Brazil, and significant privacy rulings in the E.U. relating to the “Schrems II” case, which imposed significant changes to the way companies export personal data from the E.U. We have had to implement new requirements set out in these laws within our business before the effective date, requiring significant time and resources. This new guidance issued to firms by the European Regulators has and will continue to require significant time to implement and may require significant effort to review and effect applicable changes to IT systems and transfer methods. Non-compliance with new and existing laws could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others and additional costs in connection therewith. We expect additional jurisdictions to continue to adopt new privacy regulations and that existing regulations may be amended as governments continue to legislate in respect of personal data. We have incurred expenses and devoted resources, and will continue to incur expenses and devote resources, to bring our practices into compliance with these regulations and future regulations. Our failure to comply with or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability, result in proceedings or fines against us by governmental 24entities or others, or impair our reputation in the marketplace. Further, regulatory initiatives in the area of data protection are more frequently including provisions allowing authorities to impose substantial fines and penalties, and therefore, failure to comply could also have a significant financial impact.Risks Related to the Pending Acquisition of NFPThe completion of the Transaction is subject to a number of conditions, and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived on a timely basis, the Transaction may not be completed.The completion of the Transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions as set forth in the Merger Agreement, including, among others, the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”), the approval of regulatory authorities in the United Kingdom and Ireland, the effectiveness of a Registration Statement and the approval for listing on NYSE of the ordinary shares of Aon to be issued in connection with the Transaction. There can be no assurance that the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act or the other conditions to the obligations of the parties to effect the Transaction will be satisfied or waived. In particular, foreign, federal, state or local governmental or regulatory authorities and, in certain instances, private parties may seek to challenge the Transaction and/or impose conditions on Aon or NFP as a condition to completion of the Transaction under applicable antitrust or other laws. In addition, there can be no assurance that any consents, clearances or approvals necessary or advisable to be obtained in connection with the Transaction will be obtained in a timely manner or at all, or whether they will be subject to actions, conditions, limitations or restrictions that may jeopardize or delay the completion of the Transaction, materially reduce or delay the anticipated benefits of the Transaction or allow the parties to terminate the Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Aon may be required to offer and agree to undertake certain specified behavioral remedies with regulatory authorities. If Aon is required to divest assets or businesses related to NFP, there can be no assurance that it will be able to negotiate such divestitures expeditiously or on favorable terms or that the governmental authorities will approve the terms of such divestitures. If the Transaction, or the integration of the companies’ respective businesses, is not completed within the expected time frame, such delay may materially and adversely affect the synergies and other benefits that Aon expects to achieve as a result of the Transaction and could result in additional costs or liabilities, loss of revenue and other adverse effects on Aon’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to complete the Transaction could have an adverse effect on Aon. If the Transaction is not completed for any reason, Aon’s ongoing business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the potential benefits of completing the Transaction, Aon will be subject to a number of risks, including the following: •Aon will be required to pay certain costs and expenses relating to the Transaction; •if the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances or circumstances related to a failure to obtain the required antitrust clearances or other regulatory clearances provided for by the Merger Agreement, Aon may be obligated to pay to NFP a termination fee equal to $250 million;•Aon may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on the market price of Aon’s securities; •the manner in which clients, vendors, business partners and other third parties perceive Aon may be negatively impacted, which in turn could affect its ability to compete for new business or to obtain renewals in the marketplace;•matters relating to the Transaction (including integration planning) may require substantial commitments of time and resources by management, which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to Aon; and•Aon could be subject to litigation related to any failure to close the Transaction or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against it to perform its obligations under the Merger Agreement. If the Transaction does not close, these risks may materialize and may adversely affect Aon’s business, financial results and market price.Aon and NFP are subject to various uncertainties, including contractual restrictions and requirements, while the Transaction is pending that could adversely affect their businesses, financial condition and results of operations.During the pendency of the Transaction, it is possible that customers, suppliers, commercial partners and/or other persons with whom Aon or NFP has a business relationship may elect to delay or defer certain business decisions or decide to seek to 25terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with Aon or NFP, as the case may be, as a result of the Transaction, which could significantly reduce the expected benefits of the Transaction and/or negatively affect Aon’s or NFP’s revenues, earnings and cash flows, NFP’s future plans and the market price of Aon ordinary shares, regardless of whether the Transaction is completed. Matters relating to the Transaction (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources by Aon management, which would otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and other opportunities that may have been beneficial to Aon. Aon will also incur significant costs related to the Transaction, some of which must be paid even if the Transaction is not completed. These costs are substantial and include financial advisory, legal and accounting costs.Each of the risks described above may be exacerbated by delays or other adverse developments with respect to the completion of the Transaction.Uncertainties associated with the Transaction may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees and Aon may have difficulty attracting and motivating management personnel and other key employees.Uncertainty about the effects of the Transaction on employees may impair the ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel during the pendency of the Transaction and, if the Transaction is completed, for a period of time thereafter. If key employees depart because of issues related to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with Aon following the completion of the Transaction, Aon may have to incur significant costs in identifying, hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees and may lose significant expertise and talent.Aon may encounter difficulty or high costs associated with the arrangement of any debt financing required for the Transaction. Aon expects to fund the cash consideration payable in the Transaction and the repayment or refinancing of NFP’s existing debt arrangements contemplated by the Merger Agreement, through debt financing. Aon’s ability to obtain debt financing, and the pricing and terms thereof, will be subject to various factors, including market conditions, operating performance and Aon’s ability to incur additional debt. The receipt of financing by Aon is not a condition to completion of the Transaction and, accordingly, Aon will be required to complete the Transaction (assuming that all of the conditions to its obligations under the Merger Agreement are satisfied) whether or not debt financing is available at all or on acceptable terms.Aon may not be able to integrate NFP successfully or manage the combined business effectively, and many of the anticipated synergies and other benefits of the Transaction may not be realized or may not be realized within the expected time frame.Aon and NFP entered into the Merger Agreement with the expectation that the Transaction would result in various benefits, including, among other things, operating efficiencies, synergies and cost savings. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the Transaction is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the businesses of Aon and NFP can be integrated in an efficient and effective manner.It is possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated or that the management of the combined organizations and achievement of anticipated synergies could be more difficult than expected. The integration of NFP into the Aon organization could also result in the disruption of ongoing businesses, processes, systems and business relationships or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, policies and compensation arrangements, any of which could adversely affect Aon’s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Transaction. The integration process is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and no assurance can be given that the anticipated benefits of the Transaction will be realized or, if realized, the timing of their realization. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could adversely affect Aon’s future businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.Aon will incur significant transaction and integration-related costs in connection with the Transaction, which could adversely affect Aon’s ability to execute its integration plan and achieve the anticipated benefits of the Transaction.Aon expects to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with the Transaction, combining the organizations and achieving anticipated synergies. These costs will be significant and additional unanticipated costs may also be incurred in connection with the Transaction and combination of the organizations. Although Aon expects that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses of Aon and NFP, should allow the Company to offset integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all.The global effective tax rate that will apply to Aon subsequent to the Transaction is uncertain and may vary from expectations. No assurances can be given as to what Aon’s global effective tax rate will be after the closing of the Transaction because of, among other things, uncertainty regarding the global mix of income following closing, uncertainty regarding the ability, 26costs and time necessary to integrate NFP’s business operations and entities, uncertainty regarding complex tax rules in NFP’s largest jurisdiction (the U.S.) and the application of those rules to Aon following closing, and uncertainty with respect to Ireland’s Pillar Two tax regime which will apply to the combined income and taxes of Aon and NFP following closing. As a result, Aon’s actual global effective tax rate may vary from expectations following the Transaction and that variance may be material.Risks Related to Being an Irish-incorporated CompanyWe are incorporated in Ireland, and Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the U.S. and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the U.S. against us in Ireland, based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the U.S. currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Ireland.As an Irish company, we are governed by the Irish Companies Act, which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of an Irish company generally are owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the U.S.In addition, depending on the circumstances, the acquisition, ownership and/or disposition of our ordinary shares may subject shareholders to different or additional tax consequences under Irish law including, but not limited to, Irish stamp duty, dividend withholding tax and capital acquisitions tax.As an Irish public limited company, certain capital structure decisions regarding the Company will require the approval of shareholders, which may limit the Company’s flexibility to manage its capital structure.Irish law generally provides that a board of directors may allot and issue shares (or rights to subscribe for or convert into shares) if authorized to do so by a company’s constitution or by an ordinary resolution of shareholders. Such authorization may be granted in respect of up to the entirety of a company’s authorized but unissued share capital and for a maximum period of five years, at which point it must be renewed by another ordinary resolution. The Company’s constitution authorizes our directors to allot shares up to the maximum of the Company’s authorized but unissued share capital for a period of five years from March 31, 2020. This authorization will need to be renewed by ordinary resolution upon its expiration and at periodic intervals thereafter. Under Irish law, an allotment authority may be given for up to five years at each renewal, but governance considerations may result in renewals for shorter periods or in respect of less than the maximum permitted number of shares being sought or approved.Irish law also generally provides shareholders with statutory pre-emption rights when new shares are issued for cash. However, it is possible for such statutory pre-emption rights to be dis-applied in a company’s constitution or by a special resolution of shareholders. Such dis-application of pre-emption rights may be given in respect of up to the entirety of a company’s authorized but unissued share capital and for a maximum period of five years, at which point it must be renewed by another special resolution. The Company’s constitution dis-applies statutory pre-emption rights up to the maximum of the Company’s authorized but unissued share capital for a period of five years from March 31, 2020. This dis-application will need to be renewed by special resolution upon its expiration and at periodic intervals thereafter. Under Irish law, a dis-application of statutory pre-emption rights may be given for up to five years at each renewal, but governance considerations may result in renewals for shorter periods or in respect of less than the maximum permitted number of unissued shares being sought or approved.Irish law requires us to have available “distributable profits” to pay dividends to shareholders and generally to make share repurchases and redemptions.Under Irish law, we may only pay dividends and, generally, make share repurchases and redemptions from distributable profits. Distributable profits may be created through the earnings of the Company or other methods (including certain intra-group reorganizations involving the capitalization of the Company’s un-distributable profits and their subsequent reduction). 27While it is our intention to maintain a sufficient level of distributable profits in order to pay dividends on our ordinary shares and make share repurchases, there is no assurance that the Company will maintain the necessary level of distributable profits to do so"
12,AON,AON PLC,2023-02-17,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
The risk factors set forth below reflect risks associated with our existing and potential businesses and the industries in which we operate generally and contain “forward-looking statements” as discussed in the “Business” Section of Part I, Item 1 of this report. Readers should consider these risks in addition to the other information contained in this report because our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected if any of these risks were to actually occur and the occurrence of such risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in or implied by the forward-looking statements in this document and elsewhere.11Risks Related to Our BusinessAn overall decline in economic and business activity could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of our business.The results of our operations are generally affected by the level of business activity of our clients, which in turn is affected by the economy of the industries and markets these clients serve. Economic downturns, volatility, or uncertainty in the broader economy or in specific markets (including as a result of endemics or pandemics, climate change, political unrest, actions by central banks, or otherwise) may cause reductions in technology and discretionary spending by our clients, which may result in reductions in the growth of new business or reductions in existing business. If our clients become financially less stable, enter bankruptcy, liquidate their operations or consolidate, our revenues and collectability of receivables could be adversely affected.The demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases, affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our Commercial Risk Solutions and Reinsurance Solutions lines. The economic activity that impacts property and casualty insurance is most closely correlated with employment levels, corporate revenues, and asset values. Downward fluctuations in the year-over-year insurance premiums charged by insurers to protect against the same risk, referred to in the industry as softening of the insurance market, could adversely affect these businesses as a significant portion of the revenue is determined as a percentage of premiums charged to our clients. In addition, certain discretionary services within our business, such as Human Capital, project-related work within Commercial Risk Solutions and Health Solutions, and transaction liability, may see a decrease in activity if the overall level of economic activity results in a reduction to our clients’ discretionary spending. Insolvencies and consolidations associated with an economic downturn, especially insolvencies in the insurance industry, could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business. Also, error and omission claims against us, which we refer to as E&O claims, may increase in economic downturns, also adversely affecting our business. In addition, decreased underwriting capacity for insurance and reinsurance may create difficulty for our professionals to place business, which may adversely impact our ability to earn revenue.We face significant competitive pressures from traditional and non-traditional competitors that could affect our business. As a global professional services firm, we compete with global, national, regional, and local insurance companies that market and service their own products, other financial services providers, brokers, and investment managers, independent firms, and consulting organizations affiliated with accounting, information systems, technology, human resources consulting, and financial services firms. We compete with respect to service, delivery of insights, product features, price, commission structure, technology, financial strength, ability to access certain insurance markets, and name recognition. Our competitors may have better financial, technical and marketing resources, broader customer bases, greater name recognition, more comprehensive products, stronger presence in certain geographies, or more established relationships with their customers and suppliers than we have.Alliances or mergers among competitors could affect our business. Further, we compete on pricing and the innovation and quality of our service offerings and could be affected by competitors’ lower cost structures, product development activities, and pricing policies, any or all of which could result in better market acceptance of our competitors’ offerings than those that we offer or develop. This competition is further intensified by an industry trend where clients elect to engage multiple brokers to service different portions of their accounts. If we fail to respond successfully to the evolving competition we face, our financial condition or results of operations might be adversely affected.If we are unable to effectively develop and implement innovative strategies, efficiencies and new solutions for our clients, our reputation, ability to compete effectively and financial condition may be adversely affected.Developing and implementing innovative strategies, efficient business practices, and new solutions to current and emerging client needs is important to our business. We may be unsuccessful in developing innovative strategies, or our competitors may be more successful in innovating and delivering services to meet new and existing client needs. Competitors may be able to innovate faster and respond better to evolving client demand and industry conditions, or price their services more aggressively than we do. Further, new and non- traditional competitors, our clients’ increasing ability and determination to self-insure, and capital market alternatives to traditional insurance and reinsurance markets cause additional forms of competition and innovation that could affect our business. If we are unsuccessful in innovating, if we cannot innovate as quickly as our competitors, if we are not able to make sufficient investment in innovation, if our competitors develop more cost-effective technologies, or if our ideas are not accepted in the marketplace, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and complete client engagements. 12For example, we have invested significantly in the development of our proprietary data and analytics tools including repositories of global insurance and reinsurance placement information, which we use to drive results for our clients in the insurance and reinsurance placement process. Our competitors have or are developing competing data and analytics tools, and their success in this space may impact our ability to differentiate our services to our clients through the use of unique technological solutions. Innovations in software, cloud computing, data and analytics or other technologies that alter how our services are delivered could significantly undermine our investment in the business if we are slow to innovate or unable to take advantage of these developments. In addition, innovation in technology, capabilities, and the entry into new lines of business, services, or products require significant investment and present additional risks to the Company, particularly in instances where the markets are new or not fully developed. Such risks include the investment of significant time and resources; the possibility that these efforts will not be successful and could result in reputational damage to us; the possibility that the marketplace does not accept our products or services or that we are unable to retain clients that adopt our new products or services; and the risk of new or additional liabilities associated with these efforts, including potential E&O or other claims.If our clients are not satisfied with our services, we may face additional cost, loss of profit opportunities, damage to our reputation, or legal liability.We depend, to a large extent, on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for high-quality advice and solutions. If a client is not satisfied with our services, it could cause us to incur additional costs and impair profitability, or lose the client relationship altogether. Moreover, if we fail to meet our contractual, common law or fiduciary obligations, we could be subject to legal liability or loss of client relationships.The nature of much of our work involves assumptions and estimates concerning future events, the actual outcome of which we cannot know with certainty in advance. For example, in our investment businesses, we may be measured based on our track record regarding judgments and advice on investments that are susceptible to influences unknown at the time the advice was given. In addition, we could make computational, software programming, or data entry or management errors. A client may claim it suffered losses due to reliance on our consulting advice or reporting, which poses risks of liability exposure and costs of defense and increased insurance premiums. Many of our clients are businesses that actively share information among themselves about the quality of service they receive from their vendors. Adverse statements or claims from clients (including clients in the public sector or whose activities are frequently covered by the press) may receive media attention or other publicity. Accordingly, poor service to one client may negatively impact our relationships with multiple other clients. Damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business.We advise our clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, financial condition, and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters or others could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential clients and existing and future employees, which could make it difficult for us to attract new clients and employees and retain existing ones. Negative public opinion could also result from actual or alleged conduct by us or those currently or formerly associated with us. Damage to our reputation, including as a result of negative perceptions or publicity regarding a class of business, environmental matters, climate change, workforce diversity, pay equity, harassment, social justice, cyber security or data privacy, or our inability to meet commitments or client and stakeholder expectations with respect to such matters, could affect the confidence of our clients, rating agencies, regulators, stockholders, employees and third parties in transactions that are important to our business adversely affecting our business, financial condition, and operating results.Revenues from commission arrangements may fluctuate due to many factors, including cyclical or permanent changes in the insurance and reinsurance markets outside of our control.Revenues from commission arrangements have historically been affected by significant fluctuations arising from uncertainties and changes in the industries in which we operate. A significant portion of our revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage. We have no control over premium rates, and our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction. The potential for changes in premium rates is significant, due to pricing cyclicality in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets.In addition to movements in premium rates, our ability to generate premium-based commission revenue may be challenged by:•the growing availability of alternative methods for clients to meet their risk-protection needs, including a greater willingness on the part of corporations to “self-insure,” the use of so-called “captive” insurers, and the development of 13capital markets-based solutions and other alternative capital sources for traditional insurance and reinsurance needs that increase market capacity, increase competition, and put pressure on premiums;•decreases in available underwriting capacity for insurance and reinsurance;•fluctuation in the need for, or relevancy of, insurance;•the level of compensation, as a percentage of premium, that insurance carriers are willing to compensate brokers for placement activity;•the growing desire of clients to move away from variable commission rates and instead compensate brokers based upon flat fees, which can negatively impact us as fees are not consistently indexed for inflation and may not rise as much as commission-based compensation;•competition from insurers seeking to sell their products directly to consumers, including online sales, without the involvement of an insurance broker; and•growing number of technology-enabled competitors offering new risk-transfer solutions that eliminate the traditional broker-client relationship in both commercial insurance and reinsurance markets.The profitability of our operations may not meet our expectations due to unexpected costs, cost overruns, inflation, early contract terminations, unrealized assumptions used in our contract bidding process or the inability to maintain our prices.Our profitability is highly dependent upon our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency. As we adapt to changes in our business and the market, adapt to the regulatory environment, enter into new engagements, acquire additional businesses, and take on new employees in new locations, we may not be able to manage our large, diverse and changing workforce, control our costs, or improve our efficiency.Our profit margin, and therefore our profitability, is largely a function of the revenue generated from our services and the staffing costs for our personnel and related expenses. Accordingly, if we are not able to maintain the rates we charge for our services or appropriately manage the staffing costs of our personnel and related expenses, we may not be able to sustain our profit margin and our profitability will suffer. The prices we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors, including competitive factors, the extent of ongoing clients’ perception of our ability to add value through our services, and general economic conditions. If we cannot drive suitable cost efficiencies, our profit margins will suffer. Our cost efficiencies may also be impacted by factors such as our ability to transition consultants from completed projects to new assignments, our ability to secure new business, our ability to forecast demand for our services (and, consequently, appropriately manage the size and location of our workforce), our ability to develop, attract and retain suitable capabilities and talent, our ability to obtain third party services at favorable prices, our ability to manage key suppliers to maximize delivery, product and efficiency opportunities, inflation (including wage inflation) and the need to devote time and resources to training and professional and business development.In our investment businesses, we advise or act on behalf of clients regarding their investments. The results of these investments are uncertain and subject to numerous factors, some of which are within our control and some which are not. Clients that experience losses or lower than expected investment returns may leave us for competitors and/or assert claims against us.Our investment businesses provide advice to clients on: investment strategy, which can include advice on setting investment objectives, asset allocation, and hedging strategies; selection (or removal) of investment managers; the investment in different investment instruments and products; and the selection of other investment service providers such as custodians and transition managers. For some clients, we are responsible for making decisions on these matters and we may implement such decisions in a fiduciary or agency capacity without assuming title over the underlying funds or assets invested. Asset classes may experience poor absolute performance and third parties we recommend or select, such as investment managers, may underperform their benchmarks due to poor market performance, negligence, or other reasons, resulting in poor investment returns or losses. These losses may be attributable in whole or in part to alleged failures on our part or to events entirely outside of our control, including but not limited to uncertainty or volatility in financial markets due to economic, political, and regulatory conditions or pandemics. Plaintiffs have filed, and may continue to file, individual and class action lawsuits alleging investment consultants have charged excessive fees, given improper advice or taken investment actions due to conflicts of interest, or recommended investments that underperformed other investments available at the time. Defending against these claims can involve potentially significant costs, including legal defense costs, as well as cause substantial distraction, publicity and diversion of other resources. If any lawsuit – against the Company or any other investment consultant or asset manager – results in a large adverse verdict, the size of the verdict or resultant negative adverse publicity may prompt the filing of additional lawsuits. Furthermore, our ability to limit our potential liability is restricted in certain jurisdictions and in connection with claims involving breaches of fiduciary or agency duties or other alleged errors or omissions.14The anticipated benefits of the redomiciliation from the U.K. to Ireland may not be realized.In April 2020, we changed the jurisdiction of incorporation for our parent company from the U.K. to Ireland by means of a scheme of arrangement under English law (the “Ireland Reorganization”). At the time of the Ireland Reorganization we expected, and we continue to expect, that the Ireland Reorganization will, among other things, provide greater certainty around ongoing access to existing U.S. treaties with other E.U. member states from which we derive benefit. However, we may not realize the benefits we anticipate from the Ireland Reorganization, which could have an adverse effect on our business.Financial RisksWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows.We face exposure to adverse movements in exchange rates of currencies other than our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, as a significant portion of our business is located outside of the U.S. These exposures may change over time, and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. Approximately 55% of our consolidated revenue is non-U.S., attributed on the basis of where the services are performed, and where products are sold, and the exposures created can have significant currency volatility. These currency exchange fluctuations create risk in both the translation of the financial results of our global subsidiaries into U.S. dollars for our consolidated financial statements, as well as in those of our operations that receive revenue and incur expenses other than in their respective local currencies, which can reduce the profitability of our operations based on the direction the respective currencies’ exchange rates move. A decrease in the value of certain currencies relative to other currencies could place us at a relative disadvantage compared to our competitors that benefit to a greater degree from a specific exchange rate move and can, as a result, deliver services at a lower cost or receive greater revenues from such a transaction. Although we use various derivative financial instruments to help protect against certain adverse foreign exchange rate fluctuations, we cannot eliminate such risks, and, as a result, changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results. For example, the strengthening of the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies might adversely affect the value of our products and services when translated to U.S. dollar, even if the value of such products and services has not changed in their original currency.Changes in interest rates and deterioration of credit quality could reduce the value of our cash balances and investment portfolios and adversely affect our financial condition or results.Operating funds available for corporate use were $1,142 million at December 31, 2022 and are reported in Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments. Of the total balance, $115 million was restricted to its use as of December 31, 2022. Funds held on behalf of clients and insurers were $6.4 billion at December 31, 2022 and are reported in Fiduciary assets. We also carry an investment portfolio of other long-term investments. As of December 31, 2022, these long-term investments had a carrying value of $60 million. Adverse changes in interest rates, performance, and counterparty credit quality, including default, could reduce the value of these funds and investments, thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results. We may experience reduced investment earnings on our cash and short-term investments of fiduciary and operating funds if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk fall below their current levels, or if negative yields on deposits or investments are experienced, as we have experienced in Japan and certain jurisdictions in the E.U. On the other hand, higher interest rates could result in a higher discount rate used by investors to value our future cash flows thereby resulting in a lower valuation of the Company. In addition, during times of stress in the banking industry, counterparty risk can quickly escalate, potentially resulting in substantial losses for us as a result of our cash or other investments with such counterparties, as well as substantial losses for our clients and the insurance companies with which we work.Our pension obligations and value of our pension assets could adversely affect our shareholders’ equity, net income, cash flow, and liquidity.To the extent that the pension obligations associated with our pension plans continue to exceed the fair value of the assets supporting those obligations, our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected. In particular, lower interest rates and investment returns could result in the present value of plan liabilities increasing at a greater rate than the value of plan assets, resulting in higher unfunded positions in our pension plans. In addition, the periodic revision of pension assumptions or variances of actual results from our assumptions can materially change the present value of expected future benefits, and therefore the funded status of the plans and resulting net periodic pension expense. As a result, we may experience future changes in the funded status of our plans that could require us to make additional cash contributions beyond those that have been estimated and which could adversely affect shareholders’ equity, net income, cash flow and liquidity.Our worldwide pension plans are significant, and therefore our pension contributions and expense are sensitive to various market, demographic, and other factors. These factors include equity and bond market returns, fair value of pension assets, the assumed interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities, foreign exchange rates, rates of inflation, mortality assumptions, potential regulatory and legal changes or developments, and counterparty exposure from various investments and derivative contracts, including annuities. Variations or developments in connection with any of these factors could cause 15significant changes to our financial position and results of operations from year to year. In addition, contributions are generally based on statutory requirements and local funding practices, which may differ from measurements under U.S. GAAP.We have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility.As of December 31, 2022, we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately $10.8 billion. The level of debt outstanding could adversely affect our financial flexibility by reducing our ability to use cash from operations for other purposes, including working capital, dividends to shareholders, share repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. We also are subject to risks that, at the time any of our outstanding debt matures, we will not be able to retire or refinance the debt on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.As of December 31, 2022, we had two committed credit facilities outstanding. Each of these facilities is intended to support our commercial paper obligations and our general working capital needs. In addition, each of these facilities included customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios of adjusted consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense and consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated EBITDA, tested quarterly.A substantial portion of our outstanding debt, including certain intercompany debt obligations, contains financial and other covenants. The terms of these covenants may limit our ability to obtain, or increase the costs of obtaining, additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or general corporate requirements. This in turn may have the impact of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, thereby placing us at a relative disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness, or fewer or less onerous covenants associated with such indebtedness, and making us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions.If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity, or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments, and alliances, any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business. Additionally, we may not be able to take such actions or refinance any of our debt, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.A decline in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper may adversely affect our borrowing costs, access to capital, and financial flexibility.A downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper could increase our borrowing costs, reduce or eliminate our access to capital, reduce our financial flexibility, and limit our ability to implement our corporate strategy. Our senior debt ratings at December 31, 2022 were A- with a stable outlook (S&P), BBB+ with a stable outlook (Fitch), and Baa2 with a stable outlook (Moody’s). Our commercial paper ratings were A-2 (S&P), F-2 (Fitch) and P-2 (Moody’s).Real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect any trading market for, or trading value of, our securities. Such changes could result from any number of factors, including the modification by a credit rating agency of the criteria or methodology it applies to particular issuers, a change in the agency’s view of us or our industry, or as a consequence of actions we take to implement our corporate strategies. A change in our credit rating could adversely affect our access to capital and our competitive position.Our tax assets and liabilities are subject to a variety of different factors, which could create volatility in our global effective tax rate, expose us to greater than anticipated tax liabilities or cause us to adjust previously recognized tax assets and liabilities.We are, and anticipate we will be, subject to income taxes in Ireland, the U.K., the U.S. and many other jurisdictions. As a result, our global effective tax rate from period to period can be affected by many factors, including changes in tax legislation or regulations, the continuing development of regulations and other governmental action that affect the application of such legislation, our global mix of earnings, the use of global funding structures, the tax characteristics of our income, the effect of complying with transfer pricing requirements under laws of many different countries on our revenues and costs, the consequences of acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and business segments. In addition, we could be subject to increased taxation as a result of changes in eligibility for the benefits of current income tax treaties between and among Ireland, the U.K., the U.S and other countries, including any future amendments to the current income tax treaties between and among such countries, or any new statutory or regulatory provisions that might limit our ability to take advantage of any such treaties. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes, and our determination of the amount of our tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities. Our actual global tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material.16The overall tax environment in the jurisdictions in which we are or may be subject to taxes is highly uncertain and increasingly complex. Countries around the world are considering changes in their tax laws and regulations. In the U.S., the Inflation Reduction Act introduced, among other changes, a 1% excise tax on certain stock redemptions by U.S. corporations (which the U.S. Treasury indicated may also apply to certain stock redemptions of foreign corporations deemed funded by their U.S. affiliates). The OECD, a global coalition of member countries, proposed a plan to reform international taxation which includes the introduction of a global minimum tax. The OECD recommendations have been nominally accepted by many countries within and without the OECD, but the implementation in each country remains subject to the possibility of significant variation, which could lead to a risk of multiple levels of taxation on Aon’s income. The U.K. and E.U. member states, among others, have introduced draft legislation or otherwise agreed to implement a global minimum tax that would be consistent with the OECD recommendations, beginning, for Aon, in 2024. There remains significant uncertainty as to if, when and how the various OECD proposals will ultimately be enacted. If and when effective, the global minimum tax could have a material adverse effect on our global effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.We are, and anticipate we will be, subject to tax audits conducted by Ireland, the U.K., the U.S., and other tax authorities, and the resolution of such audits could impact our tax rate in future periods, as would any reclassification or other changes (such as those in applicable accounting rules) that increases the amounts we have provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements. The tax laws and regulations in Ireland, the U.K., the U.S., and the other tax jurisdictions in which we operate are inherently complex, and we will be obligated to make judgments and interpretations about the application of these laws and regulations to our operations and businesses. The interpretation and application of these laws and regulations could be challenged by the relevant governmental authorities, which could result in administrative or judicial procedures, actions or sanctions, which could be material. There can be no assurance that we would be successful in attempting to mitigate the adverse impacts resulting from any changes in tax laws and regulations, including any changes in the interpretation of such tax authorities, or from audits and other matters. Our inability to mitigate the negative consequences of such actions could cause our global effective tax rate to increase, our use of cash to increase and our financial condition and results of operations to suffer.Changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements. We are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, those relating to revenue recognition, pensions, recoverability of assets including customer receivables, valuation of goodwill and intangibles, contingencies, share-based payments, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances. These assumptions and estimates involve the exercise of judgment and discretion, which may evolve over time in light of operational experience, regulatory direction, developments or changes in accounting principles or standards, and other factors. Actual results could differ from these estimates, or changes in assumptions, estimates, policies, or developments in the business may change our initial estimates, which could materially affect the Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Financial Position, Shareholders’ Equity, and Cash Flows.We may be required to record goodwill or other long-lived asset impairment charges, which could result in a significant charge to earnings.Under U.S. GAAP, we review our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or other long-lived assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our share price or market capitalization, reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry. We may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or other long- lived assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and other long-lived assets. Future goodwill or other long-lived asset impairment charges could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.We are a holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends or other payments in needed amounts from our subsidiaries.The Company is organized as a holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating entities. As a holding company without significant operations of its own, our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our subsidiaries. We rely on dividends, interest, and other payments from these subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt, paying dividends to shareholders, repurchasing ordinary shares, and corporate 17expenses. Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate or other restrictions that may limit the amounts that subsidiaries can pay in dividends or other payments to us. No assurance can be given that there will not be further changes in law, regulatory actions, or other circumstances that could restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise make payments to us. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that our subsidiaries may be able to make timely payments to us in order for us to meet our obligations.Legal and Regulatory RisksWe are subject to E&O claims against us as well as other contingencies and legal proceedings, some of which, if determined unfavorably to us, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.We assist our clients with various matters, including advising on and placing insurance and reinsurance coverage and handling related claims, consulting on various human resources matters, and providing actuarial, investment consulting, and asset management services. E&O claims against us may allege our potential liability for damages arising from these services. E&O claims could include, for example, the failure of our employees or sub-agents, whether negligently or intentionally, to place coverage correctly or notify carriers of claims on behalf of clients, to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured, or the failure to give error-free consulting or investment advice. It is not always possible to prevent and detect E&Os, and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases. In addition, we are subject to other types of claims, litigation, and proceedings in the ordinary course of business, which along with E&O claims, may seek damages, including punitive damages, in amounts that could, if awarded, have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, earnings, and cash flows. In addition to potential liability for monetary damages, such claims or outcomes could harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business.We have historically purchased, and intend to continue to purchase, insurance to cover E&O claims and other insurance to provide protection against certain losses that arise in such matters and other matters related to our operations. However, we may be unable to maintain, at commercially reasonable rates, our current levels of insurance coverage for E&O claims or other risks in future periods. Also, we have exhausted or materially depleted our coverage under some of the policies that protect us for certain years and, consequently, are self-insured or materially self-insured for some historical claims. Additionally, parts or all of an E&O claim could fall within insurance deductibles, self-insured retentions, or policy exclusions. Accruals for these exposures, and related insurance receivables, when applicable, have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable. These accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as developments warrant and may also be adversely affected by disputes we may have with our insurers over coverage. Amounts related to settlement provisions are recorded in Other general expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Discussion of some of these claims, lawsuits, and proceedings are contained in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.In addition, we provide a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to our customers and others. In the event of a default, our potential exposure is equal to the amount of the guarantee or indemnification.The ultimate outcome of claims, lawsuits, proceedings, guarantees and indemnifications cannot be ascertained, and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us. It is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters.Our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which could reduce our profitability, limit our growth, or subject us to legal and regulatory actions.Our businesses are subject to extensive legal and regulatory oversight throughout the world, including the Irish Companies Act, the U.S. securities laws, rules, and regulations, the rules and regulations promulgated by the FCA and a variety of other laws, rules, and regulations addressing, among other things, licensing, privacy and data protection, trade sanctions laws, restrictions and export controls, anti-money laundering, wage-and-hour standards, employment and labor relations, antitrust and competition, anti-corruption, currency, reserves, government contracting, and the amount of local investment with respect to our operations in certain countries. This legal and regulatory oversight could reduce our profitability or limit our growth by: increasing the costs of legal and regulatory compliance; limiting or restricting the products or services we sell, the markets we serve or enter, the methods by which we sell our products and services, the overall structure of our business units, the type of services and prices we can charge for our services, or the form of compensation we can accept from our clients, carriers, and third parties; or by subjecting our businesses to the possibility of legal and regulatory actions, proceedings, or fines.The global nature of our operations increases the complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations adding to our cost of doing business. In addition, many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions, increasing the complexity and cost of compliance. In emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less developed legal systems, local laws and regulations may not be established with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us adequate assurance that we are operating our business in a compliant manner with all required licenses or that our rights are otherwise protected. In addition, certain laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the 18Foreign Account Tax Compliance provisions of the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act in the U.S., and the Bribery Act of 2010 in the U.K., impact our operations outside of the legislating country by imposing requirements for the conduct of overseas operations, and in several cases, requiring compliance by foreign subsidiaries.In addition to the complexity of the laws and regulations themselves, the development of new laws and regulations or changes in application or interpretation of current laws and regulations or conflict between them also increases our legal and regulatory compliance complexity. Additionally, our acquisitions of new businesses and our continued operational changes and entry into new jurisdictions and new service offerings increases our legal and regulatory compliance complexity, as well as the type of governmental oversight to which we may be subject. Changes in laws and regulations could mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions, impose additional licensure requirements or costs to our operations and services, or cause us to cease offering certain services or solutions. Furthermore, as we enter new jurisdictions or businesses and further develop and expand our services, including through acquisitions, we may become subject to additional types of laws and governmental oversight and supervision, such as those applicable to the financial lending or other service institutions. Regulatory developments that could result in changes that adversely affect us or cause us to change our business or operations include: additional requirements respecting data privacy, data security, and data usage in jurisdictions in which we operate that may increase our costs of compliance and potentially reduce the manner in which we can use data; changes in tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate; regulatory actions or changes that require us to change our compensation model; or additional regulations promulgated by , regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which we operate.Governmental and public attention to climate change and environmental matters, including new or enhanced reporting, diligence or disclosure rules and regulations, could expand the nature, scope, and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess, and report. These and other rapidly changing laws, rules and regulations, may increase the cost of our compliance and risk management and otherwise impact our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, the shift toward a lower-carbon economy, driven by changes in laws, rules and regulations, low-carbon technology advancement, consumer sentiment, and/or liability risks, may negatively impact our business model and/or the business models of our clients. In addition, as governments, investors and other stakeholders face additional pressures to accelerate actions to address climate change and other ESG topics, governments and other stakeholders may impose new rules or expectations causing a shift in disclosure and other behaviors that may negatively impact our business.In all jurisdictions, the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities. Generally, such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant, renew, and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations. Accordingly, we may have a license revoked or be unable to obtain new licenses and therefore be precluded or suspended from carrying on or developing some or all of our activities or otherwise fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction. No assurances can be given that our business can further develop or continue to be conducted in any given jurisdiction in the future as it has been conducted in the past. Changes in the regulatory scheme, or even changes in how existing regulations are interpreted, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations by limiting revenue streams or increasing costs of compliance. Our business’ regulatory oversight also includes licensing of insurance brokers and agents, managing general agency or general underwriting operations, and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Our continuing ability to provide insurance broking in the jurisdictions in which we operate depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions, and our failure to adhere to these rules and regulations can expose us to fines or other sanctions. Also, we can be affected indirectly by the governmental regulation and supervision of insurance companies. For instance, if we are providing or managing general underwriting services for an insurer, we may have to contend with regulations affecting our client.Services provided in our Health Solutions and Wealth Solutions businesses are also the subject of ever-evolving government regulation, either because the services provided to our clients are regulated directly or because third parties upon whom we rely to provide services to clients are regulated, thereby indirectly affecting the manner in which we provide services to those clients. In particular, our health care exchange business depends upon the private sector of the U.S. insurance system and its role in financing health care delivery, and insurance carriers’ use and payment of commissions to agents, brokers, and other organizations to market and sell individual and family health insurance products and plans. Uncertainty regarding, or any changes to, state or federal law, or the interpretation of such law by applicable regulatory agencies could delay client adoption of our health care exchanges, impair our ability to retain clients who have adopted our health care exchanges, or cause insurance carriers to alter or eliminate the products and plans that they offer or attempt to move members into new products or plans for which we receive lower commissions. In addition, changes in laws, government regulations, or the way those regulations are interpreted in the jurisdictions in which we operate could affect the viability, value, use, or delivery of benefits and human resources programs, including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans (such as medical), defined 19contribution plans (such as 401(k)), or defined benefit plans (such as pension), may adversely affect the demand for, or profitability of, our services.If we violate the laws and regulations to which we are subject, we could be subject to fines, penalties, or criminal sanctions and could be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate these laws and regulations, causing an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.Heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny may lead to additional regulatory investigations, increased government involvement, or enforcement actions, which could consume significant management time and resources and could have adverse effects on our business and operations. For instance, increased scrutiny by competition authorities may increase our costs of doing business or force us to change the way we conduct business or refrain from or otherwise alter the way we engage in certain activities. Additionally, we could suffer significant financial or reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest, which exist or could exist any time we or any of our employees have or may have an interest in a transaction or engagement that is inconsistent with our clients’ interests. This could occur, for example, when we are providing services to multiple parties in connection with a transaction. We also provide services to advise and assist in satisfying all our clients’ needs from all our businesses, creating a greater potential for conflicts with advisory services.Due to the broad scope of our businesses and our client base, we regularly address potential conflicts of interest, including, without limitation, situations where our services to a particular client or our own investments or other interests conflict, or are perceived to conflict, with the interests of another client. If these are not adequately identified and managed, this could then lead to failure or perceived failure to protect the client’s interests, with consequential regulatory and reputational risks, including litigation or enforcement actions that could adversely affect us and our operations. Identifying conflicts of interest may also prove particularly difficult as we continue to bring systems and information together and integrate newly acquired businesses. In addition, we may not be able to adequately address such conflicts of interest.Insurance intermediaries have traditionally been remunerated by base commissions paid by insurance carriers in respect of insurance placements for clients, or by fees paid by clients. Intermediaries also obtain other revenue from insurance carriers. This revenue, when derived from carriers in their capacity as insurance markets (as opposed to as corporate clients of the intermediaries where they may be purchasing insurance or reinsurance or other non-market related services), is commonly known as MDI. MDI is another example of an area in which potential conflicts of interest may arise. This revenue may be subject to scrutiny by various regulators under conflict of interest, anti-trust, unfair competition, conduct and anti-bribery laws and regulations. MDI takes a variety of forms, including volume- or profit-based contingent commissions, facilities administration charges, business development agreements, and fees for providing consulting services to carriers. While accepting MDI is a lawful and acceptable business practice, we cannot predict whether our position will result in regulatory or other scrutiny and our controls may not be fully effective. Failure to protect our intellectual property rights, or allegations that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others, could harm our reputation, ability to compete effectively, and financial condition.To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on a combination of trademark laws, copyright laws, patent laws, trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements, and other contractual arrangements with our affiliates, employees, clients, strategic partners, and others, as well as internal policies and procedures regarding our management of intellectual property. However, the protective steps that we take may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Further, we operate in many jurisdictions and effective trademark, copyright, patent, and trade secret protection may not be available or adequate in every country or jurisdiction in which we offer our services or employ our colleagues. Additionally, our competitors may develop products similar to our products that do not conflict with our related intellectual property rights. Failure to protect our intellectual property adequately could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively.In addition, to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, we may initiate litigation against third parties, such as infringement suits or interference proceedings. Third parties may assert intellectual property rights claims against us, which may be costly to defend, could require the payment of damages, and could limit our ability to use or offer certain technologies, products, or other intellectual property. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be expensive, take significant time and divert management’s attention from other business concerns. Successful challenges against us could require us to modify or discontinue our use of technology or business processes where such use is found to infringe or violate the rights of others, or require us to purchase licenses from third parties, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.20Operational RisksOur results of operations have been adversely affected and could be materially adversely affected in the future by the COVID-19 global pandemic.The COVID-19 global pandemic and the emergence of COVID-19 variants has created significant public health concerns and significant volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption in every region where we operate.A number of evolving factors related to the global pandemic and the post-pandemic recovery period may influence the duration, nature and extent of the impact on our business and financial results. Such factors include worldwide macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates, employment rates, consumer confidence and spending, gross domestic product, property values, and changes in client behavior, and foreign exchange rates in each of the markets in which we operate; business closures; changes in laws, regulations (including those changes that may provide for extended premium payment terms), and guidance; court decisions and litigation trends; a decline in business and the ability of counterparties to pay for our services on time or at all; an increased number of E&O claims in those areas impacted by the pandemic, as well as an increase in the incidence or severity of E&O claims against us and our market partners; our ability to sell and provide our services, including due to the impact of travel restrictions, lockdowns, quarantines, social distancing, and alternative work arrangements; the health of, and the effect of the pandemic on, our employees; political disruption; potential effects on our internal controls and risk mitigation processes, including those over financial reporting, as a result of changes in working environments for our employees and business partners; resurgences of spread; identification of new, more contagious variants of the virus; resulting “lockdowns,” government restrictions, mandates, requirements or recommendations; and uncertainties in vaccine adoption.In addition, the continuing COVID-19 pandemic or other epidemics or pandemics, may again create significant disruptions or volatility in the credit or financial markets, or impact our credit ratings, which could adversely affect our ability to access capital on favorable terms or at all. Finally, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or other epidemics or pandemics may heighten other risks discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and stock price.The economic and political conditions of the countries and regions in which we operate could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity, and prospects for growth.Our operations in countries undergoing political change or experiencing economic instability are subject to uncertainty and risks that could materially adversely affect our business. These risks include, particularly in emerging markets, the possibility we would be subject to undeveloped or evolving legal systems, unstable governments and economies, impacts from geopolitical conflicts, and potential governmental actions affecting the flow of goods, services, and currency.Our success depends on our ability to retain, attract and develop experienced and qualified personnel, including our senior management team and other personnel.We depend, in material part, upon the members of our senior management team who possess extensive knowledge and a deep understanding of our business and our strategy, as well as the colleagues who are critical to developing and retaining client relationships. The unexpected loss of services of any of these senior leaders could have a disruptive effect adversely impacting our ability to manage our business effectively and execute our business strategy. Additionally, competition for professional personnel remains intense, and we are constantly working to retain, attract and develop these professionals. If we cannot successfully do so, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. We may also become involved in disputes and litigation in connection with our efforts to retain and hire personnel, which can be disruptive to our business and may expose us to potential liability for monetary damages. While we have plans for key management succession and long-term compensation plans designed to retain our senior management team and critical colleagues, if our succession plans and retention programs do not operate effectively, our business could be adversely affected. We strive to maintain an equitable work environment that unlocks the full potential of all of our personnel - this includes our commitment to diversity and inclusion, focus on colleague wellness and mental health, and building a flexible work environment that meets colleague and client needs. If we are unsuccessful in maintaining such a work environment or adapting to colleague needs or expectations, we could experience difficulty attracting and retaining personnel, which could have a negative impact on our business.21Our global operations expose us to various international risks that could adversely affect our business.Our operations are conducted globally. Accordingly, we are subject to regulatory, legal, economic, and market risks associated with global operations and sourcing, including:•difficulties in staffing and managing our offices, and overseeing joint venture operations and compliance in disparate jurisdictions, including due to unexpected inflation (including wage inflation) or job turnover, and the increased travel, infrastructure, and legal and compliance costs and risks associated with multiple international locations;•hyperinflation in certain countries;•the impacts of geopolitical conflicts;•conflicting regulations across the countries in which we do business;•imposition of investment requirements or other restrictions by governments in certain countries;•longer payment cycles;•greater difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;•insufficient demand for our services in certain jurisdictions;•our ability to execute effective and efficient cross-border sourcing of services on behalf of our clients;•the reliance on or use of third parties to perform services on behalf of the Company;•disparate tax regimes;•restrictions on the import and export of technologies; and•trade barriers.Our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to develop, implement, update, and enhance solutions to support our business operations or if we are not able to effectively drive value for our clients. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to enhance and implement the systems necessary to operate our businesses and to achieve intended efficiencies and improvements. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to rapid and continuing changes in technology, data and analytics, industry standards and client preferences. The effort to gain necessary expertise and achieve internal efficiencies through technology and data and analytics require us to incur significant expenses, and we may not be successful in identifying the optimal funding priorities. We make investments in technology and data and analytics to operate our businesses and achieve intended efficiencies; however, our investments and enhancements may not be sufficient to respond needs across all of our businesses. In addition, if we are not successful in developing and maintaining expertise in process excellence, technology and data trends, our business performance may be compromised.The occurrence of natural or man-made disasters could result in declines in business and increases in claims that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We are exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes, extreme weather, or other climate events; pandemic health events, and man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism, civil unrest, violence, military actions, and cyber-terrorism (including, but not limited to, ransomware). The continued threat of terrorism and other events or disasters may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, and a natural or man-made disaster could trigger energy shortages, public health issues, or an economic downturn or instability in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster. These consequences could, among other things, result in a decline in business and increased claims from those areas. They could also result in reduced underwriting capacity, making it more difficult for our professionals to place business. Disasters also could disrupt public and private infrastructure, including communications and financial services, which could disrupt our normal business operations. If access to underwriting markets for certain lines of coverage becomes unavailable or difficult due to the impact of climate change on the claims environment, this may have a negative impact on our clients’ access to coverage, which could in turn reduce our ability to place certain lines of coverage and negatively impact our business.A natural or man-made disaster also could disrupt the operations of our counterparties or result in increased prices for the products and services they provide to us. In addition, a disaster could adversely affect the value of the assets in our investment portfolio. Finally, a natural or man-made disaster could increase the incidence or severity of E&O claims against us. Climate change may increase the likelihood or severity of a natural or man-made disaster.Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, or legal liability.Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our personnel, offices, and technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations. Should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as a security incident or attack, a natural disaster, climate 22event, terrorist attack, pandemic, power loss, telecommunications failure, or other natural or man-made disaster, our continued success will depend, in part, on the availability of our personnel and office facilities, and the proper functioning of computer systems, telecommunications, and other related systems and operations. In events like these, while our operational size, the multiple locations from which we operate, and our existing back-up systems provide us with some degree of flexibility, we still can experience near-term operational challenges in particular areas of our operations. We could potentially lose access to key executives, personnel, or client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario. A disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions, or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships, or legal liability.We rely on third parties to perform key functions of our business operations enabling our provision of services to our clients. These third parties may act in ways that could harm our business.We rely on third parties, and in some cases subcontractors, to provide services, data, and information such as technology, information security, funds transfers, data processing, support functions, and administration that are critical to the operations of our business. These third parties include correspondents, agents and other brokerage and intermediaries, insurance markets, data providers, plan trustees, payroll service providers, benefits administrators, software and system vendors, business process outsourcing providers, health plan providers, investment managers, and providers of human resources, among others. As we do not fully control the actions of these third parties, we are subject to the risk that their decisions, actions, or inactions may adversely impact us and replacing these service providers could create significant delay and expense. Our failure to manage our key suppliers and our day-to-day operations with effective controls, and/or a failure by third parties to comply with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements in a high quality and timely manner, particularly during periods of our peak demand for their services, could result in economic, legal, and reputational harm to us. In addition, we face risks as we transition from in-house functions to third- party support functions and providers that there may be disruptions in service or other unintended results that may adversely affect our business operations. These third parties face their own technology, operating, business, and economic risks, and any significant failures by them, including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client, employee, or company information, could cause harm to our business and reputation. An interruption in or the cessation of service by any service provider as a result of systems failures, cybersecurity or data privacy incidents (including, but not limited to, ransomware), capacity constraints, financial difficulties, or for any other reason could disrupt our operations, impact our ability to offer certain products and services, and result in contractual or regulatory penalties, liability claims from clients, or employees, damage to our reputation, and harm to our business.Our business is exposed to risks associated with the handling of client funds.Certain of our businesses collect premiums from insureds and remits the premiums to the respective insurers. We also collect claims or refunds from insurers on behalf of insureds, which are then remitted to the insureds. Consequently, at any given time, we may be holding and managing funds of our clients. This function creates a risk of loss arising from, among other things, fraud by employees or third parties, execution of unauthorized transactions, errors relating to transaction processing, or other cybersecurity events or security breaches. We are also potentially at risk in the event the financial institution in which we hold these funds suffers any kind of insolvency or liquidity event. The occurrence of any of these types of events in connection with this function could cause us financial loss and reputational harm.In connection with the implementation of our corporate strategies and initiatives, we face risks associated with, among others, the acquisition or disposition of businesses, the integration and development of acquired businesses, and the entry into new lines of business or products.In pursuing our corporate strategy, we often acquire other businesses or dispose of or exit businesses we currently own and we routinely are actively engaged in the process of identifying, analyzing, and negotiating possible transactions. The success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate acquisition and disposition targets, negotiate transactions on favorable terms, secure regulatory approval of transactions where required, complete transactions and, in the case of acquisitions, successfully integrate them into our existing businesses and culture. If we are unable to identify appropriate acquisition targets, or if our competitors are more successful in identifying acquisition targets at favorable valuations, we may we fail to achieve desired strategic goals, capabilities and efficiencies, and our results of operations might be adversely affected. If a proposed transaction is not consummated, the time and resources spent pursuing it could adversely impact employees, clients and shareholders and the failure to consummate a proposed transaction could result in payment of termination fees and reimbursement of expenses, reputational harm, disputes and litigation and missed opportunities to locate and acquire other businesses. If acquisitions are made, there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, including, but not limited to, revenue growth, operational efficiencies, or expected synergies, and we could incur unexpected costs in connection with integration. If we dispose of or otherwise exit certain businesses, there can be no assurance that we will 23not incur certain disposition related charges, will not be subject to post-closing liabilities, obligations or restrictions, will be able to reduce overhead related to the divested assets, or will realize the intended benefits of the disposition.We may enter new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business either through acquisitions or through initiative to generate organic revenue growth. These new lines of business, products, and services present the Company with additional risks, particularly in instances where the markets are new or not fully developed. Such risks include the investment of significant time and resources; the possibility that these efforts will not be successful and could result in reputational damage to us; the possibility that the marketplace does not accept our products or services or that we are unable to retain clients that adopt our new products or services; and the risk of new or additional liabilities associated with these efforts, including potential E&O or other claims. In addition, many of the businesses that we acquire and develop will likely have significantly smaller scales of operations prior to the implementation of our growth strategy. If we are not able to manage the growing complexity of these businesses, including improving, refining, or revising our systems and operational practices, and enlarging the scale and scope of the businesses, our business may be adversely affected. Other risks include developing knowledge of and experience in the new business, product or service, integrating the acquired business into our systems and culture, recruiting and retaining experienced professionals, and developing and capitalizing on new relationships with experienced market participants. External factors, such as compliance with new or revised regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business, products, or services. Failure to manage these risks in the acquisition or development of new businesses could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in connection with the sale of the Divested Business.On May 1, 2017, the Company completed the sale of the benefits administration and business process outsourcing business (the “Divested Business) to an entity controlled by affiliates of The Blackstone Group L.P. (the “Buyer”). This transaction carries inherent risks, including the risk that we will not earn the $500 million of additional consideration or otherwise realize the intended value of the transaction. Risks Related to Technology, Cybersecurity, and Data ProtectionWe rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business. Any significant system or network disruption due to a breach in the security of our information technology systems could have a negative impact on our reputation, operations, sales, and operating results.We rely on the efficient, uninterrupted, and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks, some of which are within the Company and some of which are outsourced to third parties. All information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including but not limited to cyber-attacks, computer viruses, security breaches, and unauthorized access or improper actions by insiders or employees. We are at risk of attack by a growing list of adversaries through new and increasingly sophisticated methods of attack, including methods that take advantage of remote work scenarios due to COVID-19. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, implement adequate preventative measures, or detect and respond quickly enough in the event of an incident or attack. We regularly experience social engineering attempts, and increasingly sophisticated attempted attacks to our systems and networks. Aon has from time to time experienced cybersecurity incidents, such as computer viruses, unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems, ransomware incidents, data loss via malicious and non-malicious methods, and similar incidents, which to date have not had a material impact on our business. If we are unable to efficiently and effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards, we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access. Problems with the information technology systems of vendors, including breakdowns or other disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, difficulties in the migration of services or data to third parties or the cloud hosted by third parties, cyber-attacks, and security breaches could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to customers and otherwise conduct business. Additionally, we are a global and acquisitive organization and we therefore might not adequately identify weaknesses in certain of our information systems, including those of targets we acquire, which could expose us to unexpected liabilities and fines or make our own systems more vulnerable to attack. These types of incidents affecting us, our clients, insurance carriers, vendors, or other third-parties could result in intellectual property or other confidential information being lost or stolen, including client or employee personal information or company data.We have implemented various measures to manage our risks related to system and network security and disruptions, but a security breach or a significant or extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems could damage our reputation, cause us to lose clients, adversely impact our operations, sales, and operating results, and require us to incur significant expense (in connection with incident response, remediation efforts, or otherwise) and divert resources to address and 24remediate or otherwise resolve such issues. Additionally, in order to maintain the level of security, service, and reliability that our clients require, we may be required to make significant additional investments in our information technology system.Improper disclosure of confidential, personal, or proprietary data could result in regulatory scrutiny, legal liability, or harm to our reputation.One of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our employees’ and clients’ confidential and proprietary information, including confidential information about our clients’ and employees’ compensation, medical information, and other personally identifiable information. We maintain policies, procedures, and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information. Nonetheless, we have experienced cyber incidents and cannot eliminate the risk of human error, employee or vendor malfeasance, or cyber-attacks that could result in improper access to or disclosure of confidential, personal, or proprietary information. Such access or disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws and regulations that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs, fines, loss of revenue, and loss of clients. The release of confidential information as a result of a security breach could also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals or business partners, or by regulators, and the outcome of such proceedings, which could include penalties or fines, could have a significant negative impact on our business.In many jurisdictions, including in the E.U. and the U.S., we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the collection, use, retention, security, and transfer of this information. These laws and regulations are frequently changing and are becoming increasingly complex and sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services both in terms of substance and in terms of enforceability. This makes compliance challenging and expensive. Additionally, certain jurisdictions’ regulations include notice provisions that may require us to inform affected clients or employees in the event of a breach of confidential information before we fully understand or appreciate the extent of the breach. These notice provisions present operational challenges and related risk. In particular, there have been a number of recently adopted privacy laws around the globe including in China and, Brazil, and significant privacy rulings in the E.U. relating to the “Schrems II” case, which imposed significant changes to the way companies export personal data from the E.U. We have had to implement new requirements set out in these laws within our business before the effective date causing distraction from other aspects of our business. This new guidance issued to firms by the European Regulators has and will continue to require significant time to implement and may require significant effort to review and effect applicable changes to IT systems and transfer methods. Non-compliance with new and existing laws could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others and additional costs in connection therewith. We expect additional jurisdictions to continue to adopt new privacy regulations and there to be amendments to existing regulations as governments continue to legislate in respect of personal data. We have and will continue to incur expenses and devote resources to bring our practices into compliance with these regulations and future regulations. Our failure to comply with or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability, result in proceedings or fines against us by governmental entities or others, or impair our reputation in the marketplace. Further, regulatory initiatives in the area of data protection are more frequently including provisions allowing authorities to impose substantial fines and penalties, and therefore, failure to comply could also have a significant financial impact.Risks Related to Being an Irish-incorporated CompanyWe are incorporated in Ireland, and Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the U.S. and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the U.S. against us in Ireland, based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the U.S. currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Ireland.As an Irish company, we are governed by the Irish Companies Act, which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of an Irish company generally are owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the U.S.25In addition, depending on the circumstances, the acquisition, ownership and/or disposition of our ordinary shares may subject shareholders to different or additional tax consequences under Irish law including, but not limited to, Irish stamp duty, dividend withholding tax and capital acquisitions tax.As an Irish public limited company, certain capital structure decisions regarding the Company will require the approval of shareholders, which may limit the Company’s flexibility to manage its capital structure.Irish law generally provides that a board of directors may allot and issue shares (or rights to subscribe for or convert into shares) if authorized to do so by a company’s constitution or by an ordinary resolution of shareholders. Such authorization may be granted in respect of up to the entirety of a company’s authorized but unissued share capital and for a maximum period of five years, at which point it must be renewed by another ordinary resolution. The Company’s constitution authorizes our directors to allot shares up to the maximum of the Company’s authorized but unissued share capital for a period of five years from March 31, 2020. This authorization will need to be renewed by ordinary resolution upon its expiration and at periodic intervals thereafter. Under Irish law, an allotment authority may be given for up to five years at each renewal, but governance considerations may result in renewals for shorter periods or in respect of less than the maximum permitted number of shares being sought or approved.Irish law also generally provides shareholders with statutory pre-emption rights when new shares are issued for cash. However, it is possible for such statutory pre-emption rights to be dis-applied in a company’s constitution or by a special resolution of shareholders. Such dis-application of pre-emption rights may be given in respect of up to the entirety of a company’s authorized but unissued share capital and for a maximum period of five years, at which point it must be renewed by another special resolution. The Company’s constitution dis-applies statutory pre-emption rights up to the maximum of the Company’s authorized but unissued share capital for a period of five years from March 31, 2020. This dis-application will need to be renewed by special resolution upon its expiration and at periodic intervals thereafter. Under Irish law, a dis-application of statutory pre-emption rights may be given for up to five years at each renewal, but governance considerations may result in renewals for shorter periods or in respect of less than the maximum permitted number of unissued shares being sought or approved.Irish law requires us to have available “distributable profits” to pay dividends to shareholders and generally to make share repurchases and redemptions.Under Irish law, we may only pay dividends and, generally, make share repurchases and redemptions from distributable profits. Distributable profits may be created through the earnings of the Company or other methods (including certain intra-group reorganizations involving the capitalization of the Company’s un-distributable profits and their subsequent reduction). While it is our intention to maintain a sufficient level of distributable profits in order to pay dividends on our ordinary shares and make share repurchases, there is no assurance that the Company will maintain the necessary level of distributable profits to do so"
6,AON,AON PLC,2022-02-18,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
The risk factors set forth below reflect risks associated with our existing and potential businesses and the industries in which we operate generally and contain “forward-looking statements” as discussed in the “Business” Section of Part I, Item 1 of this report. Readers should consider these risks in addition to the other information contained in this report because our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected if any of these risks were to actually occur and the occurrence of such risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in or implied by the forward-looking statements in this document and elsewhere.11Risks Related to Our BusinessAn overall decline in economic and business activity could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of our business.The results of our operations are generally affected by the level of business activity of our clients, which in turn is affected by the economy of the industries and markets these clients serve. Economic downturns, volatility, or uncertainty in the broader economy or in specific markets (including as a result of endemics or pandemics, climate change, political unrest, or otherwise) may cause reductions in technology and discretionary spending by our clients, which may result in reductions in the growth of new business or reductions in existing business. If our clients become financially less stable, enter bankruptcy, liquidate their operations or consolidate, our revenues and collectability of receivables could be adversely affected.The demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases, affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our Commercial Risk Solutions, Reinsurance Solutions, and Wealth Solutions lines. The economic activity that impacts property and casualty insurance is most closely correlated with employment levels, corporate revenues, and asset values. Downward fluctuations in the year-over-year insurance premiums charged by insurers to protect against the same risk, referred to in the industry as softening of the insurance market, could adversely affect these businesses as a significant portion of the earnings are determined as a percentage of premiums charged to our clients. In addition, certain discretionary services within our business, such as Human Capital, project-related work within Commercial Risk Solutions and Health Solutions, and transaction liability, may see a decrease in activity if the overall level of economic activity results in a reduction to our clients’ discretionary spending. Insolvencies and consolidations associated with an economic downturn, especially insolvencies in the insurance industry, could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business. Also, error and omission claims against us, which we refer to as E&O claims, may increase in economic downturns, also adversely affecting our business.We face significant competitive pressures from traditional and non-traditional competitors that could affect our business. As a global professional services firm, we compete with global, national, regional, and local insurance companies that market and service their own products, other financial services providers, brokers, and investment managers, independent firms, and consulting organizations affiliated with accounting, information systems, technology, and financial services firms. We compete with respect to service, delivery of insights, product features, price, commission structure, technology, financial strength, ability to access certain insurance markets, and name recognition. Our competitors may have better financial, technical and marketing resources, broader customer bases, greater name recognition, more comprehensive products, stronger presence in certain geographies, or more established relationships with their customers and suppliers than we have.In addition, alliances among competitors or mergers of competitors could affect our business, and some of our competitors may have or may develop a lower cost structure, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, or provide services that gain greater market acceptance than the services that we offer or develop. Our competitors may be more successful in innovating and delivering services to meet new and existing client needs. Competitors may be able to respond to the need for technological changes, innovate faster, respond better to evolving client demand and industry conditions, or price their services more aggressively than we do. They may also compete for skilled professionals, finance acquisitions, fund internal growth, and compete for business more effectively than we do. Further, new and non- traditional competitors, our clients’ increasing ability and determination to self-insure, and capital market alternatives to traditional insurance and reinsurance markets cause additional forms of competition and innovation that could affect our business. This competition is further intensified by an industry trend where clients elect to engage multiple brokers to service different portions of their accounts. If we fail to respond successfully to the to the evolving competition we face, our financial condition or results of operations might be adversely affected.If our clients are not satisfied with our services, we may face additional cost, loss of profit opportunities, damage to our reputation, or legal liability.We depend, to a large extent, on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for high-quality advice and solutions. If a client is not satisfied with our services, it could cause us to incur additional costs and impair profitability, or lose the client relationship altogether. Moreover, if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, we could be subject to legal liability or loss of client relationships.The nature of much of our work involves assumptions and estimates concerning future events, the actual outcome of which we cannot know with certainty in advance. For example, in our investment consulting business, we may be measured based on our track record regarding judgments and advice on investments that are susceptible to influences unknown at the time the advice was given. In addition, we could make computational, software programming, or data entry or management errors. A 12client may claim it suffered losses due to reliance on our consulting advice, which poses risks of liability exposure and costs of defense and increased insurance premiums. Many of our clients are businesses that actively share information among themselves about the quality of service they receive from their vendors. Accordingly, poor service to one client may negatively impact our relationships with multiple other clients. Damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business.We advise our clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, financial condition, and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters or others could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential clients and existing and future employees, which could make it difficult for us to attract new clients and employees and retain existing ones. Negative public opinion could also result from actual or alleged conduct by us or those currently or formerly associated with us. Damage to our reputation, including as a result of negative perceptions or publicity regarding environmental matters, climate change, workforce diversity, pay equity, harassment, social justice, cyber security or data privacy, or our inability to meet commitments or client and stakeholder expectations with respect to such matters, could affect the confidence of our clients, rating agencies, regulators, stockholders, employees and third parties in transactions that are important to our business adversely affecting our business, financial condition, and operating results.Revenues from commission arrangements may fluctuate due to many factors, including cyclical or permanent changes in the insurance and reinsurance markets outside of our control.Revenues from commission arrangements have historically been affected by significant fluctuations arising from uncertainties and changes in the industries in which we operate. A significant portion of our revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage. We have no control over premium rates, and our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction. The potential for changes in premium rates is significant, due to pricing cyclicality in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets.In addition to movements in premium rates, our ability to generate premium-based commission revenue may be challenged by:•the growing availability of alternative methods for clients to meet their risk-protection needs, including a greater willingness on the part of corporations to “self-insure,” the use of so-called “captive” insurers, and the development of capital markets-based solutions and other alternative capital sources for traditional insurance and reinsurance needs that increase market capacity, increase competition, and put pressure on pricing;•fluctuation in the need for, or relevancy of, insurance;•the level of compensation, as a percentage of premium, that insurance carriers are willing to compensate brokers for placement activity;•the growing desire of clients to move away from variable commission rates and instead compensate brokers based upon flat fees, which can negatively impact us as fees are not generally indexed for inflation and may not rise as much as commission-based compensation;•competition from insurers seeking to sell their products directly to consumers, including online sales, without the involvement of an insurance broker; and•growing number of technology-enabled competitors offering new risk-transfer solutions that eliminate the traditional broker-client relationship in both commercial insurance and reinsurance markets.The profitability of our operations may not meet our expectations due to unexpected costs, cost overruns, inflation, early contract terminations, unrealized assumptions used in our contract bidding process or the inability to maintain our prices.Our profitability is highly dependent upon our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency. As we adapt to changes in our business and the market, adapt to the regulatory environment, enter into new engagements, acquire additional businesses, and take on new employees in new locations, we may not be able to manage our large, diverse and changing workforce, control our costs, or improve our efficiency.Our profit margin, and therefore our profitability, is largely a function of the revenue generated from our services and the staffing costs for our personnel. Accordingly, if we are not able to maintain the rates we charge for our services or appropriately manage the staffing costs of our personnel, we may not be able to sustain our profit margin and our profitability will suffer. The 13prices we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors, including competitive factors, the extent of ongoing clients’ perception of our ability to add value through our services, and general economic conditions. If we cannot drive suitable cost efficiencies, our profit margins will suffer. Our cost efficiencies may also be impacted by factors such as our ability to transition consultants from completed projects to new assignments, our ability to secure new business, our ability to forecast demand for our services (and, consequently, appropriately manage the size and location of our workforce), employee attrition, inflation (including wage inflation) and the need to devote time and resources to training and professional and business development.In our investment consulting business, we advise or act on behalf of clients regarding their investments. The results of these investments are uncertain and subject to numerous factors, some of which are within our control and some which are not. Clients that experience losses or lower than expected investment returns may leave us for competitors and/or assert claims against us.Our investment consulting business provides advice to clients on: investment strategy, which can include advice on setting investment objectives, asset allocation, and hedging strategies; selection (or removal) of investment managers; the investment in different investment instruments and products; and the selection of other investment service providers such as custodians and transition managers. For some clients, we are responsible for making decisions on these matters and we may implement such decisions in a fiduciary or agency capacity without assuming title over the underlying funds or assets invested. Asset classes may experience poor absolute performance and third parties we recommend or select, such as investment managers, may underperform their benchmarks due to poor market performance, negligence, or other reasons, resulting in poor investment returns or losses. These losses may be attributable in whole or in part to failures on our part or to events entirely outside of our control, including but not limited to uncertainty or volatility in financial markets due to economic, political, and regulatory conditions or pandemics. Plaintiffs have, and may continue to, file individual and class action lawsuits alleging investment consultants have charged excessive fees, given improper advice due to conflicts of interest, or recommended investments that underperformed other investments available at the time. Defending against these claims can involve potentially significant costs, including legal defense costs, as well as cause substantial distraction and diversion of other resources. If any lawsuit – against the Company or any other investment consultant – results in a large adverse verdict, the size of the verdict or resultant negative adverse publicity may prompt the filing of additional lawsuits. Furthermore, our ability to limit our potential liability is restricted in certain jurisdictions and in connection with claims involving breaches of fiduciary or agency duties or other alleged errors or omissions.The anticipated benefits of the redomiciliation from the U.K. to Ireland may not be realized.In April 2020, we changed the jurisdiction of incorporation for our parent company from the U.K. to Ireland by means of a scheme of arrangement under English law (the “Reorganization”). At the time of the Reorganization we expected, and we continue to expect, that the Reorganization will, among other things, provide greater certainty around ongoing access to existing U.S. treaties with other EU member countries from which we derive benefit. However, we may not realize the benefits we anticipate from the Reorganization, which could have an adverse effect on our business.Financial RisksWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows.We face exposure to adverse movements in exchange rates of currencies other than our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, as a significant portion of our business is located outside of the U.S. These exposures may change over time, and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. Approximately 55% of our consolidated revenue is non-U.S., attributed on the basis of where the services are performed, and where products are sold, and the exposures created can have significant currency volatility. These currency exchange fluctuations create risk in both the translation of the financial results of our global subsidiaries into U.S. dollars for our consolidated financial statements, as well as in those of our operations that receive revenue and incur expenses other than in their respective local currencies, which can reduce the profitability of our operations based on the direction the respective currencies’ exchange rates move. A decrease in the value of certain currencies relative to other currencies could place us at a relative disadvantage compared to our competitors that benefit to a greater degree from a specific exchange rate move and can, as a result, deliver services at a lower cost or receive greater revenues from such a transaction. Although we use various derivative financial instruments to help protect against certain adverse foreign exchange rate fluctuations, we cannot eliminate such risks, and, as a result, changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results. For example, the strengthening of the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies might adversely affect the value of our products and services when translated to U.S. dollar, even if the value of such products and services has not changed in their original currency.14Changes in interest rates and deterioration of credit quality could reduce the value of our cash balances and investment portfolios and adversely affect our financial condition or results.Operating funds available for corporate use were $836 million at December 31, 2021 and are reported in Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments. Of the total balance, $160 million was restricted to its use as of December 31, 2021. Funds held on behalf of clients and insurers were $6.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and are reported in Fiduciary assets. We also carry an investment portfolio of other long-term investments. As of December 31, 2021, these long-term investments had a carrying value of $64 million. Adverse changes in interest rates, performance, and counterparty credit quality, including default, could reduce the value of these funds and investments, thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results. We may experience reduced investment earnings on our cash and short-term investments of fiduciary and operating funds if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain at or near their current low levels or fall below their current levels, or if negative yields on deposits or investments are experienced, as we have experienced in Japan and certain jurisdictions in the E.U. On the other hand, higher interest rates could result in a higher discount rate used by investors to value our future cash flows thereby resulting in a lower valuation of the Company. In addition, during times of stress in the banking industry, counterparty risk can quickly escalate, potentially resulting in substantial losses for us as a result of our cash or other investments with such counterparties, as well as substantial losses for our clients and the insurance companies with which we work.Our pension obligations and value of our pension assets could adversely affect our shareholders’ equity, net income, cash flow, and liquidity.To the extent that the pension obligations associated with our pension plans continue to exceed the fair value of the assets supporting those obligations, our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected. In particular, lower interest rates and investment returns could result in the present value of plan liabilities increasing at a greater rate than the value of plan assets, resulting in higher unfunded positions in our pension plans. In addition, the periodic revision of pension assumptions or variances of actual results from our assumptions can materially change the present value of expected future benefits, and therefore the funded status of the plans and resulting net periodic pension expense. As a result, we may experience future changes in the funded status of our plans that could require us to make additional cash contributions beyond those that have been estimated and which could adversely affect shareholders’ equity, net income, cash flow and liquidity.Our worldwide pension plans are significant, and therefore our pension contributions and expense are sensitive to various market, demographic, and other factors. These factors include equity and bond market returns, fair value of pension assets, the assumed interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities, foreign exchange rates, rates of inflation, mortality assumptions, potential regulatory and legal changes or developments, and counterparty exposure from various investments and derivative contracts, including annuities. Variations or developments in connection with any of these factors could cause significant changes to our financial position and results of operations from year to year. In addition, contributions are generally based on statutory requirements and local funding practices, which may differ from measurements under U.S. GAAP.We have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility.As of December 31, 2021, we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately $9.4 billion. The level of debt outstanding could adversely affect our financial flexibility by reducing our ability to use cash from operations for other purposes, including working capital, dividends to shareholders, share repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. We also are subject to risks that, at the time any of our outstanding debt matures, we will not be able to retire or refinance the debt on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.As of December 31, 2021, we had two committed credit facilities outstanding. Each of these facilities is intended to support our commercial paper obligations and our general working capital needs. In addition, each of these facilities included customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios of adjusted consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense and consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated EBITDA, tested quarterly.A substantial portion of our outstanding debt, including certain intercompany debt obligations, contains financial and other covenants. The terms of these covenants may limit our ability to obtain, or increase the costs of obtaining, additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or general corporate requirements. This in turn may have the impact of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, thereby placing us at a relative disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness, or fewer or less onerous covenants associated with such indebtedness, and making us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions.If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity, or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments, and alliances, any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business. 15Additionally, we may not be able to take such actions or refinance any of our debt, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.A decline in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper may adversely affect our borrowing costs, access to capital, and financial flexibility.A downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper could increase our borrowing costs, reduce or eliminate our access to capital, reduce our financial flexibility, and limit our ability to implement on corporate strategy. Our senior debt ratings at December 31, 2021 were A- with a stable outlook S&P, BBB+ with a stable outlook (Fitch), and Baa2 with a stable outlook (Moody’s). Our commercial paper ratings were A-2 (S&P), F-2 (Fitch) and P-2 (Moody’s).Real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect any trading market for, or trading value of, our securities. Such changes could result from any number of factors, including the modification by a credit rating agency of the criteria or methodology it applies to particular issuers, a change in the agency’s view of us or our industry, or as a consequence of actions we take to implement our corporate strategies. A change in our credit rating could adversely limit our access to capital and our competitive position.Our global effective tax rate is subject to a variety of different factors, which could create volatility in that tax rate, expose us to greater than anticipated tax liabilities or cause us to adjust previously recognized tax assets and liabilities.We are, and anticipate we will be, subject to income taxes in Ireland, the U.K., the U.S. and many other jurisdictions. As a result, our global effective tax rate from period to period can be affected by many factors, including changes in tax legislation or regulations, the continuing development of regulations and other governmental action that affect the application of such legislation, our global mix of earnings, the use of global funding structures, the tax characteristics of our income, the effect of complying with transfer pricing requirements under laws of many different countries on our revenues and costs, the consequences of acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and business segments. In addition, we could be subject to increased taxation as a result of changes in eligibility for the benefits of current income tax treaties between and among Ireland, the U.K., the U.S and other countries, including any future amendments to the current income tax treaties between and among such countries, or any new statutory or regulatory provisions that might limit our ability to take advantage of any such treaties. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes, and our determination of the amount of our tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities. Our actual global tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material.The overall tax environment in the jurisdictions in which we are or may be subject to taxes is highly uncertain and increasingly complex. Countries around the world are considering changes in their tax laws and regulations. In the U.S., various proposals to raise corporate income taxes are under active consideration, which could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The OECD, a global coalition of member countries, proposed a plan to reform international taxation which includes the introduction of a global minimum tax. There remains significant uncertainty as to if, when and how the various OECD proposals will ultimately be enacted in the various countries in which Aon is or may be subject to taxes, including the E.U. member states, and, if enacted, the extent of their impact. Some of the proposals, if enacted, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.We are, and anticipate we will be, subject to tax audits conducted by Ireland, the U.K., the U.S., and other tax authorities, and the resolution of such audits could impact our tax rate in future periods, as would any reclassification or other changes (such as those in applicable accounting rules) that increases the amounts we have provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements. The tax laws and regulations in Ireland, the U.K., the U.S., and the other tax jurisdictions in which the we operate are inherently complex, and we will be obligated to make judgments and interpretations about the application of these laws and regulations to our operations and businesses. The interpretation and application of these laws and regulations could be challenged by the relevant governmental authorities, which could result in administrative or judicial procedures, actions or sanctions, which could be material. There can be no assurance that we would be successful in attempting to mitigate the adverse impacts resulting from any changes in tax laws and regulations, including any changes in the interpretation of such tax authorities, or from audits and other matters. Our inability to mitigate the negative consequences of such actions could cause our global effective tax rate to increase, our use of cash to increase and our financial condition and results of operations to suffer.Changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets 16and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements. We are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, those relating to revenue recognition, pensions, recoverability of assets including customer receivables, valuation of goodwill and intangibles, contingencies, share-based payments, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances. These assumptions and estimates involve the exercise of judgment and discretion, which may evolve over time in light of operational experience, regulatory direction, developments or changes in accounting principles or standards, and other factors. Actual results could differ from these estimates, or changes in assumptions, estimates, policies, or developments in the business may change our initial estimates, which could materially affect the Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Financial Position, Shareholders’ Equity, and Cash Flows.We may be required to record goodwill or other long-lived asset impairment charges, which could result in a significant charge to earnings.Under U.S. GAAP, we review our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or other long-lived assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our share price or market capitalization, reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry. We may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or other long- lived assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and other long-lived assets. Future goodwill or other long-lived asset impairment charges could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.We are a holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends or other payments in needed amounts from our subsidiaries.The Company is organized as a holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating entities. As a holding company without significant operations of its own, our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our subsidiaries. We rely on dividends, interest, and other payments from these subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt, paying dividends to shareholders, repurchasing ordinary shares, and corporate expenses. Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate or other restrictions that may limit the amounts that subsidiaries can pay in dividends or other payments to us. No assurance can be given that there will not be further changes in law, regulatory actions, or other circumstances that could restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise make payments to us. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that our subsidiaries may be able to make timely payments to us in order for us to meet our obligations.Legal and Regulatory RisksWe are subject to E&O claims against us as well as other contingencies and legal proceedings, some of which, if determined unfavorably to us, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.We assist our clients with various matters, including advising on and placing insurance and reinsurance coverage and handling related claims, consulting on various human resources matters, and providing actuarial, investment consulting, and asset management services. E&O claims against us may allege our potential liability for damages arising from these services. E&O claims could include, for example, the failure of our employees or sub-agents, whether negligently or intentionally, to place coverage correctly or notify carriers of claims on behalf of clients, to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured, or the failure to give error-free consulting or investment advice. It is not always possible to prevent and detect E&O, and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases. In addition, we are subject to other types of claims, litigation, and proceedings in the ordinary course of business, which along with E&O claims, may seek damages, including punitive damages, in amounts that could, if awarded, have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, earnings, and cash flows. In addition to potential liability for monetary damages, such claims or outcomes could harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business.We have historically purchased, and intend to continue to purchase, insurance to cover E&O claims and other insurance to provide protection against certain losses that arise in such matters. However, we have exhausted or materially depleted our coverage under some of the policies that protect us for certain years and, consequently, are self-insured or materially self-insured for some historical claims. Additionally, parts or all of an E&O claim could fall within insurance deductibles, self-insured retentions, or policy exclusions. Accruals for these exposures, and related insurance receivables, when applicable, have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable. These accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as developments warrant and may also be adversely affected by disputes we may have with our insurers over coverage. Amounts related to settlement provisions are recorded in Other general expenses in the Consolidated 17Statements of Income. Discussion of some of these claims, lawsuits, and proceedings are contained in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.In addition, we provide a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to our customers and others. In the event of a default, our potential exposure is equal to the amount of the guarantee or indemnification.The ultimate outcome of claims, lawsuits, proceedings, guarantees and indemnifications cannot be ascertained, and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us. It is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters.Our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which could reduce our profitability, limit our growth, or subject us to legal and regulatory actions.Our businesses are subject to extensive legal and regulatory oversight throughout the world, including the Irish Companies Act, the U.S. securities laws, rules, and regulations, the rules and regulations promulgated by the FCA and a variety of other laws, rules, and regulations addressing, among other things, licensing, data privacy and protection, trade sanctions laws, restrictions and export controls, anti-money laundering, wage-and-hour standards, employment and labor relations, anti-competition, anti-corruption, currency, reserves, government contracting, and the amount of local investment with respect to our operations in certain countries. This legal and regulatory oversight could reduce our profitability or limit our growth by: increasing the costs of legal and regulatory compliance; limiting or restricting the products or services we sell, the markets we serve or enter, the methods by which we sell our products and services, the overall structure of our business units, the type of services and prices we can charge for our services, or the form of compensation we can accept from our clients, carriers, and third parties; or by subjecting our businesses to the possibility of legal and regulatory actions, proceedings, or fines.The global nature of our operations increases the complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations adding to our cost of doing business. In addition, many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions, increasing the complexity and cost of compliance. In emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less developed legal systems, local laws and regulations may not be established with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us adequate assurance that we are operating our business in a compliant manner with all required licenses or that our rights are otherwise protected. In addition, certain laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance provisions of the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act in the U.S., and the Bribery Act of 2010 in the U.K., impact our operations outside of the legislating country by imposing requirements for the conduct of overseas operations, and in several cases, requiring compliance by foreign subsidiaries.In addition to the complexity of the laws and regulations themselves, the development of new laws and regulations or changes in application or interpretation of current laws and regulations or conflict between them also increases our legal and regulatory compliance complexity. Additionally, our acquisitions of new businesses and our continued operational changes and entry into new jurisdictions and new service offerings increases our legal and regulatory compliance complexity, as well as the type of governmental oversight to which we may be subject. Changes in laws and regulations could mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions, impose additional licensure requirements or costs to our operations and services, or cause us to cease offering certain services or solutions. Furthermore, as we enter new jurisdictions or businesses and further develop and expand our services, including through acquisitions, we may become subject to additional types of laws and governmental oversight and supervision, such as those applicable to the financial lending or other service institutions. Regulatory developments that could result in changes that adversely affect us or cause us to change our business or operations include: additional requirements respecting data privacy, data security, and data usage in jurisdictions in which we operate that may increase our costs of compliance and potentially reduce the manner in which we can use data; changes in tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate; regulatory actions or changes that require us to change our compensation model; or additional regulations promulgated by , regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which we operate.Governmental and public attention to climate change and environmental matters, including new or enhanced reporting, diligence or disclosure rules and regulations, could expand the nature, scope, and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess, and report. These and other rapidly changing laws, rules and regulations, may increase the cost of our compliance and risk management and otherwise impact our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, the shift toward a lower-carbon economy, driven by changes in laws, rules and regulations, low-carbon technology advancement, consumer sentiment, and/or liability risks, may negatively impact our business model and/or the business models of our clients. In addition, as governments, investors and other stakeholders face additional pressures to accelerate actions to address climate change and other ESG topics, governments and other stakeholders may impose new rules or expectations causing a shift in disclosure and other behaviors that may negatively impact our business.18In all jurisdictions, the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities. Generally, such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant, renew, and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations. Accordingly, we may have a license revoked or be unable to obtain new licenses and therefore be precluded or suspended from carrying on or developing some or all of our activities or otherwise fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction. No assurances can be given that our business can further develop or continue to be conducted in any given jurisdiction in the future as it has been conducted in the past. Changes in the regulatory scheme, or even changes in how existing regulations are interpreted, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations by limiting revenue streams or increasing costs of compliance. Our business’ regulatory oversight also includes licensing of insurance brokers and agents, managing general agency or general underwriting operations, and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Our continuing ability to provide insurance broking in the jurisdictions in which we operate depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions, and our failure to adhere to these rules and regulations can expose us to fines or other sanctions. Also, we can be affected indirectly by the governmental regulation and supervision of insurance companies. For instance, if we are providing or managing general underwriting services for an insurer, we may have to contend with regulations affecting our client.Services provided in our Health Solutions and Wealth Solutions businesses are also the subject of ever-evolving government regulation, either because the services provided to our clients are regulated directly or because third parties upon whom we rely to provide services to clients are regulated, thereby indirectly affecting the manner in which we provide services to those clients. In particular, our health care exchange business depends upon the private sector of the U.S. insurance system and its role in financing health care delivery, and insurance carriers’ use and payment of commissions to agents, brokers, and other organizations to market and sell individual and family health insurance products and plans. Uncertainty regarding, or any changes to, state or federal law, or the interpretation of such law by applicable regulatory agencies could delay client adoption of our health care exchanges, impair our ability to retain clients who have adopted our health care exchanges, or cause insurance carriers to alter or eliminate the products and plans that they offer or attempt to move members into new products or plans for which we receive lower commissions. In addition, changes in laws, government regulations, or the way those regulations are interpreted in the jurisdictions in which we operate could affect the viability, value, use, or delivery of benefits and human resources programs, including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans (such as medical), defined contribution plans (such as 401(k)), or defined benefit plans (such as pension), may adversely affect the demand for, or profitability of, our services.If we violate the laws and regulations to which we are subject, we could be subject to fines, penalties, or criminal sanctions and could be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate these laws and regulations, causing an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.Heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny may lead to additional regulatory investigations, increased government involvement, or enforcement actions, which could consume significant management time and resources and could have adverse effects on our business and operations. For instance, increased scrutiny by competition authorities may increase our costs of doing business or force us to change the way we conduct business or refrain from or otherwise alter the way we engage in certain activities. Additionally, we could suffer significant financial or reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest, which exist or could exist any time we or any of our employees have or may have an interest in a transaction or engagement that is inconsistent with our clients’ interests. This could occur, for example, when we are providing services to multiple parties in connection with a transaction. We also provide services to advise and assist in satisfying all our clients’ needs from all our businesses, creating a greater potential for conflicts with advisory services.Due to the broad scope of our businesses and our client base, we regularly address potential conflicts of interest, including, without limitation, situations where our services to a particular client or our own investments or other interests conflict, or are perceived to conflict, with the interests of another client. If these are not adequately identified and managed, this could then lead to failure or perceived failure to protect the client’s interests, with consequential regulatory and reputational risks, including litigation or enforcement actions that could adversely affect us and our operations. Identifying conflicts of interest may also prove particularly difficult as we continue to bring systems and information together and integrate newly acquired businesses. In addition, we may not be able to adequately address such conflicts of interest.Insurance intermediaries have traditionally been remunerated by base commissions paid by insurance carriers in respect of insurance placements for clients, or by fees paid by clients. Intermediaries also obtain other revenue from insurance carriers. This revenue, when derived from carriers in their capacity as insurance markets (as opposed to as corporate clients of the intermediaries where they may be purchasing insurance or reinsurance or other non-market related services), is commonly known as MDI. MDI is another example of an area in which potential conflicts of interest may arise. This revenue may be subject to scrutiny by various regulators under conflict of interest, anti-trust, unfair competition, conduct and anti-bribery laws 19and regulations. MDI takes a variety of forms, including volume- or profit-based contingent commissions, facilities administration charges, business development agreements, and fees for providing consulting services to carriers. While accepting MDI is a lawful and acceptable business practice, we cannot predict whether our position will result in regulatory or other scrutiny and our controls may not be fully effective. Failure to protect our intellectual property rights, or allegations that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others, could harm our reputation, ability to compete effectively, and financial condition.To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on a combination of trademark laws, copyright laws, patent laws, trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements, and other contractual arrangements with our affiliates, employees, clients, strategic partners, and others, as well as internal policies and procedures regarding our management of intellectual property. However, the protective steps that we take may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Further, we operate in many jurisdictions and effective trademark, copyright, patent, and trade secret protection may not be available or adequate in every country or jurisdiction in which we offer our services or employ our colleagues. Additionally, our competitors may develop products similar to our products that do not conflict with our related intellectual property rights. Failure to protect our intellectual property adequately could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively.In addition, to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, we may initiate litigation against third parties, such as infringement suits or interference proceedings. Third parties may assert intellectual property rights claims against us, which may be costly to defend, could require the payment of damages, and could limit our ability to use or offer certain technologies, products, or other intellectual property. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be expensive, take significant time and divert management’s attention from other business concerns. Successful challenges against us could require us to modify or discontinue our use of technology or business processes where such use is found to infringe or violate the rights of others, or require us to purchase licenses from third parties, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.Operational RisksOur results of operations have been adversely affected and could be materially adversely affected in the future by the COVID-19 global pandemic.The COVID-19 global pandemic and the emergence of COVID-19 variants has created significant public health concerns and significant volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption in every region where we operate.A number of evolving factors related to the global pandemic and the post-pandemic recovery period may influence the duration, nature and extent of the impact on our business and financial results. Such factors include worldwide macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates, employment rates, consumer confidence and spending, gross domestic product, property values, and changes in client behavior, and foreign exchange rates in each of the markets in which we operate; business closures; changes in laws, regulations (including those changes that may provide for extended premium payment terms), and guidance; court decisions and litigation trends; a decline in business and the ability of counterparties to pay for our services on time or at all; an increased number of E&O claims in those areas impacted by the pandemic, as well as an increase in the incidence or severity of E&O claims against us and our market partners; our ability to sell and provide our services, including due to the impact of travel restrictions, lockdowns, quarantines, social distancing, and alternative work arrangements; the health of, and the effect of the pandemic on, our employees; political disruption; potential effects on our internal controls and risk mitigation processes, including those over financial reporting, as a result of changes in working environments for our employees and business partners; resurgences of spread; identification of new, more contagious variants of the virus; resulting “lockdowns,” government restrictions, mandates, requirements or recommendations; and uncertainties in vaccine adoption.In addition, the continuing COVID-19 pandemic may again create significant disruptions or volatility in the credit or financial markets, or impact our credit ratings, which could adversely affect our ability to access capital on favorable terms or at all. Finally, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may heighten other risks discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and stock price.The economic and political conditions of the countries and regions in which we operate could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity, and prospects for growth.Our operations in countries undergoing political change or experiencing economic instability are subject to uncertainty and risks that could materially adversely affect our business. These risks include, particularly in emerging markets, the possibility 20we would be subject to undeveloped or evolving legal systems, unstable governments and economies, and potential governmental actions affecting the flow of goods, services, and currency.Furthermore, the U.K. formally withdrew from the E.U., commonly referred to as Brexit. The E.U. and U.K. ratified a trade cooperation agreement governing their future relationship in 2021 to address trade, economic arrangements, law enforcement, judicial cooperation and a governance framework including procedures for dispute resolution, among other things. Because the agreement merely sets forth a framework in many respects and requires ongoing complex additional bilateral negotiations between the U.K. and the E.U. as both parties continue to work on the rules for implementation, significant political and economic uncertainty remains. We have significant operations and a substantial workforce within the U.K., and we previously enjoyed certain benefits based on the U.K.’s membership in the E.U., and the lack of clarity around the future relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. creates uncertainty that may have a material impact on our business and operations. We may also be required to incur additional expense as we adapt to and create the ability to operate within the new political and regulatory environment. Additionally, any development that has the effect of devaluing the euro or British pound could meaningfully reduce the value of our assets and reduce the usefulness of liquidity alternatives denominated in that currency such as our multicurrency U.S. credit facility. We also deposit some of our cash, including cash held in a fiduciary capacity, with certain European financial institutions. While we continuously monitor and manage exposures associated with those deposits, to the extent the uncertainty surrounding economic stability in Europe and the future viability of the euro suddenly and adversely impacts those financial institutions, some or all of those cash deposits could be at risk.Our success depends on our ability to retain, attract and develop experienced and qualified personnel, including our senior management team and other personnel.We depend, in material part, upon the members of our senior management team who possess extensive knowledge and a deep understanding of our business and our strategy, as well as the colleagues who are critical to developing and retaining client relationships. The unexpected loss of services of any of these senior leaders could have a disruptive effect adversely impacting our ability to manage our business effectively and execute our business strategy. Additionally, competition for experienced professional personnel is increasingly intense, and we are constantly working to retain, attract and develop these professionals. If we cannot successfully do so, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. We may also become involved in disputes and litigation in connection with our efforts to retain and hire personnel, which can be disruptive to our business. While we have plans for key management succession and long-term compensation plans designed to retain our senior management team and critical colleagues, if our succession plans and retention programs do not operate effectively, our business could be adversely affected. We strive to maintain an equitable work environment that unlocks the full potential of all of our personnel - this includes our commitment to diversity and inclusion, focus on colleague wellness and mental health, and building a flexible work environment that meets colleague and client needs. If we are unsuccessful in maintaining such a work environment or adapting to colleague needs or expectations, we could experience difficulty attracting and retaining personnel, which could have a negative impact on our business.Our global operations expose us to various international risks that could adversely affect our business.Our operations are conducted globally. Accordingly, we are subject to regulatory, legal, economic, and market risks associated with global operations and sourcing, including:•difficulties in staffing and managing our offices, and overseeing joint venture operations and compliance in disparate jurisdictions, including due to unexpected inflation (including wage inflation) or job turnover, and the increased travel, infrastructure, and legal and compliance costs and risks associated with multiple international locations;•hyperinflation in certain countries;•conflicting regulations across the countries in which we do business;•imposition of investment requirements or other restrictions by governments in certain countries;•longer payment cycles;•greater difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;•insufficient demand for our services in certain jurisdictions;•our ability to execute effective and efficient cross-border sourcing of services on behalf of our clients;21•the reliance on or use of third parties to perform services on behalf of the Company;•disparate tax regimes;•restrictions on the import and export of technologies; and•trade barriers.The occurrence of natural or man-made disasters could result in declines in business and increases in claims that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We are exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes, extreme weather, or other climate events; pandemic health events, and man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism, civil unrest, violence, military actions, and cyber-terrorism (including, but not limited to, ransomware). The continued threat of terrorism and other events or disasters may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, and a natural or man-made disaster could trigger energy shortages, public health issues, or an economic downturn or instability in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster. These consequences could, among other things, result in a decline in business and increased claims from those areas. They could also result in reduced underwriting capacity, making it more difficult for our professionals to place business. Disasters also could disrupt public and private infrastructure, including communications and financial services, which could disrupt our normal business operations. If access to underwriting markets for certain lines of coverage becomes unavailable or difficult due to the impact of climate change on the claims environment, this may have a negative impact on our clients’ access to coverage, which could in turn reduce our ability to place certain lines of coverage and negatively impact our business.A natural or man-made disaster also could disrupt the operations of our counterparties or result in increased prices for the products and services they provide to us. In addition, a disaster could adversely affect the value of the assets in our investment portfolio. Finally, a natural or man-made disaster could increase the incidence or severity of E&O claims against us. Climate change may increase the likelihood or severity of a natural or man-made disaster.Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, or legal liability.Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our personnel, offices, and technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations. Should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as a security incident or attack, a natural disaster, climate event, terrorist attack, pandemic, power loss, telecommunications failure, or other natural or man-made disaster, our continued success will depend, in part, on the availability of our personnel and office facilities, and the proper functioning of computer systems, telecommunications, and other related systems and operations. In events like these, while our operational size, the multiple locations from which we operate, and our existing back-up systems provide us with some degree of flexibility, we still can experience near-term operational challenges in particular areas of our operations. We could potentially lose access to key executives, personnel, or client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario. A disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions, or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships, or legal liability.We rely on third parties to perform key functions of our business operations enabling our provision of services to our clients. These third parties may act in ways that could harm our business.We rely on third parties, and in some cases subcontractors, to provide services, data, and information such as technology, information security, funds transfers, data processing, support functions, and administration that are critical to the operations of our business. These third parties include correspondents, agents and other brokerage and intermediaries, insurance markets, data providers, plan trustees, payroll service providers, benefits administrators, software and system vendors, business process outsourcing providers, health plan providers, investment managers, and providers of human resources, among others. As we do not fully control the actions of these third parties, we are subject to the risk that their decisions, actions, or inactions may adversely impact us and replacing these service providers could create significant delay and expense. A failure by third parties to comply with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements in a high quality and timely manner, particularly during periods of our peak demand for their services, could result in economic and reputational harm to us. In addition, we face risks as we transition from in-house functions to third- party support functions and providers that there may be disruptions in service or other unintended results that may adversely affect our business operations. These third parties face their own technology, operating, business, and economic risks, and any significant failures by them, including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client, employee, or company information, could cause harm to our business and reputation. An 22interruption in or the cessation of service by any service provider as a result of systems failures, cybersecurity incidents (including, but not limited to, ransomware), capacity constraints, financial difficulties, or for any other reason could disrupt our operations, impact our ability to offer certain products and services, and result in contractual or regulatory penalties, liability claims from clients, or employees, damage to our reputation, and harm to our business.Our business is exposed to risks associated with the handling of client funds.Certain of our businesses collect premiums from insureds and remits the premiums to the respective insurers. We also collect claims or refunds from insurers on behalf of insureds, which are then remitted to the insureds. Consequently, at any given time, we may be holding and managing funds of our clients. This function creates a risk of loss arising from, among other things, fraud by employees or third parties, execution of unauthorized transactions, errors relating to transaction processing, or other cybersecurity events or security breaches. We are also potentially at risk in the event the financial institution in which we hold these funds suffers any kind of insolvency or liquidity event. The occurrence of any of these types of events in connection with this function could cause us financial loss and reputational harm.In connection with the implementation of our corporate strategies and initiatives, we face risks associated with, among others, the acquisition or disposition of businesses, the integration and development of acquired businesses, and the entry into new lines of business or products.In pursuing our corporate strategy, we often acquire other businesses or dispose of or exit businesses we currently own and we routinely are actively engaged in the process of identifying, analyzing, and negotiating possible transactions. The success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate acquisition and disposition targets, negotiate transactions on favorable terms, secure regulatory approval of transactions where required, complete transactions and, in the case of acquisitions, successfully integrate them into our existing businesses and culture. If a proposed transaction is not consummated, the time and resources spent pursuing it could adversely impact employees, clients and shareholders and the failure to consummate a proposed transaction could result in payment of termination fees and reimbursement of expenses, reputational harm, disputes and litigation and missed opportunities to locate and acquire other businesses. If acquisitions are made, there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, including, but not limited to, revenue growth, operational efficiencies, or expected synergies, and we could incur unexpected costs in connection with integration. If we dispose of or otherwise exit certain businesses, there can be no assurance that we will not incur certain disposition related charges, will not be subject to post-closing liabilities, obligations or restrictions, will be able to reduce overhead related to the divested assets, or will realize the intended benefits of the disposition.We may enter new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business either through acquisitions or through initiatives to generate organic revenue growth. These new lines of business, products, and services present the Company with additional risks, particularly in instances where the markets are new or not fully developed. Such risks include the investment of significant time and resources; the possibility that these efforts will be not be successful; the possibility that the marketplace does not accept our products or services or that we are unable to retain clients that adopt our new products or services; and the risk of new or additional liabilities associated with these efforts. In addition, many of the businesses that we acquire and develop will likely have significantly smaller scales of operations prior to the implementation of our growth strategy. If we are not able to manage the growing complexity of these businesses, including improving, refining, or revising our systems and operational practices, and enlarging the scale and scope of the businesses, our business may be adversely affected. Other risks include developing knowledge of and experience in the new business, product or service, integrating the acquired business into our systems and culture, recruiting and retaining experienced professionals, and developing and capitalizing on new relationships with experienced market participants. External factors, such as compliance with new or revised regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business, products, or services. Failure to manage these risks in the acquisition or development of new businesses could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in connection with the sale of the Divested Business.On May 1, 2017, the Company completed the sale of the benefits administration and business process outsourcing business (the “Divested Business) to an entity controlled by affiliates of The Blackstone Group L.P. (the “Buyer”). This transaction carries inherent risks, including the risk that we will not earn the $500 million of additional consideration or otherwise realize the intended value of the transaction. 23Risks Related to Technology, Cybersecurity, and Data ProtectionWe rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business. Any significant system or network disruption due to a breach in the security of our information technology systems could have a negative impact on our reputation, operations, sales, and operating results.We rely on the efficient, uninterrupted, and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks, some of which are within the Company and some of which are outsourced to third parties. All information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including but not limited to cyber-attacks, computer viruses, security breaches, and unauthorized access or improper actions by insiders or employees. We are at risk of attack by a growing list of adversaries through new and increasingly sophisticated methods of attack, including methods that take advantage of remote work scenarios due to COVID-19. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, implement adequate preventative measures, or detect and respond quickly enough in the event of an incident or attack. We regularly experience social engineering attempts, attacks to our systems and networks and have from time to time experienced cybersecurity incidents, such as computer viruses, unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems, ransomware incidents, data loss via malicious and non-malicious methods, and similar incidents, which to date have not had a material impact on our business. If we are unable to efficiently and effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards, we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access. Problems with the information technology systems of vendors, including breakdowns or other disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, difficulties in the migration of services or data to third parties or the cloud hosted by third parties, cyber-attacks, and security breaches could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to customers and otherwise conduct business. Additionally, we are a global and acquisitive organization and we therefore might not adequately identify weaknesses in certain of our information systems, including those of targets we acquire, which could expose us to unexpected liabilities and fines or make our own systems more vulnerable to attack. These types of incidents affecting us, our clients, insurance carriers, vendors, or other third-parties could result in intellectual property or other confidential information being lost or stolen, including client or employee personal information or company data.We have implemented various measures to manage our risks related to system and network security and disruptions, but a security breach or a significant or extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems could damage our reputation, cause us to lose clients, adversely impact our operations, sales, and operating results, and require us to incur significant expense and divert resources to address and remediate or otherwise resolve such issues. Additionally, in order to maintain the level of security, service, and reliability that our clients require, we may be required to make significant additional investments in our information technology system.Improper disclosure of confidential, personal, or proprietary data could result in regulatory scrutiny, legal liability, or harm to our reputation.One of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our employees’ and clients’ confidential and proprietary information, including confidential information about our clients’ and employees’ compensation, medical information, and other personally identifiable information. We maintain policies, procedures, and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information. Nonetheless, we cannot eliminate the risk of human error, employee or vendor malfeasance, or cyber-attacks that could result in improper access to or disclosure of confidential, personal, or proprietary information. Such access or disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws and regulations that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs, fines, loss of revenue, and loss of clients. The release of confidential information as a result of a security breach could also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals or business partners, or by regulators, and the outcome of such proceedings, which could include penalties or fines, could have a significant negative impact on our business.In many jurisdictions, including in the E.U. and the U.S., we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the collection, use, retention, security, and transfer of this information. These laws and regulations are frequently changing and are becoming increasingly complex and sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services both in terms of substance and in terms of enforceability. This makes compliance challenging and expensive. Additionally, certain jurisdictions’ regulations include notice provisions that may require us to inform affected clients or employees in the event of a breach of confidential information before we fully understand or appreciate the extent of the breach. These notice provisions present operational challenges and related risk. In particular, in 2021 there have been a number of new privacy laws around the globe including China, Brazil and significant privacy rulings in the E.U. relating to the “Schrems II” case, which imposed significant changes to the way companies export personal data from the E.U. We have had to implement new requirements set out in these laws within our business before the effective date causing distraction from other aspects of our business. This new guidance issued to firms by the European Regulators has and will continue to require significant time to implement and may require significant effort to review and effect applicable changes to IT systems and transfer methods. Non-compliance with new 24and existing laws could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others and additional costs in connection therewith. We expect additional jurisdictions to continue to adopt new privacy regulations and there to be amendments to existing regulations as governments continue to legislate in respect of personal data. We have and will continue to incur expenses and devote resources to bring our practices into compliance with these regulations and future regulations. Our failure to comply with or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability, result in proceedings or fines against us by governmental entities or others, or impair our reputation in the marketplace. Further, regulatory initiatives in the area of data protection are more frequently including provisions allowing authorities to impose substantial fines and penalties, and therefore, failure to comply could also have a significant financial impact.Our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to develop, implement, update, and enhance technology-based solutions to support our business operations or if we are not able to effectively drive value for our clients through innovation and technology-based solutions. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to enhance and implement the technology systems necessary to operate our businesses and to achieve intended efficiencies and improvements. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to rapid and continuing changes in technology, industry standards and client preferences. The effort to gain technological expertise, develop new technologies in our business, and achieve internal efficiencies through technology require us to incur significant expenses. We also make investments in technology-based solutions, including data and analytics solutions, for our clients. If we cannot innovate as quickly as our competitors, if our competitors develop more cost-effective technologies, or if our ideas are not accepted in the marketplace, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and complete client engagements. For example, we have invested significantly in the development of our proprietary data and analytics tools including repositories of global insurance and reinsurance placement information, which we use to drive results for our clients in the insurance and reinsurance placement process. Our competitors are developing competing data and analytics tools, and their success in this space may impact our ability to differentiate our services to our clients through the use of unique technological solutions. Innovations in software, cloud computing, data and analytics or other technologies that alter how our services are delivered could significantly undermine our investment in the business if we are slow to innovate or unable to take advantage of these developments.Risks Related to Being an Irish-incorporated CompanyWe are incorporated in Ireland, and Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the U.S. and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the U.S. against us in Ireland, based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the U.S. currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Ireland.As an Irish company, we are governed by the Irish Companies Act, which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of an Irish company generally are owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the U.S.In addition, depending on the circumstances, the acquisition, ownership and/or disposition of our ordinary shares may subject shareholders to different or additional tax consequences under Irish law including, but not limited to, Irish stamp duty, dividend withholding tax and capital acquisitions tax.As an Irish public limited company, certain capital structure decisions regarding the Company will require the approval of shareholders, which may limit the Company’s flexibility to manage its capital structure.Irish law generally provides that a board of directors may allot and issue shares (or rights to subscribe for or convert into shares) if authorized to do so by a company’s constitution or by an ordinary resolution of shareholders. Such authorization may 25be granted in respect of up to the entirety of a company’s authorized but unissued share capital and for a maximum period of five years, at which point it must be renewed by another ordinary resolution. The Company’s constitution authorizes our directors to allot shares up to the maximum of the Company’s authorized but unissued share capital for a period of five years from March 31, 2020. This authorization will need to be renewed by ordinary resolution upon its expiration and at periodic intervals thereafter. Under Irish law, an allotment authority may be given for up to five years at each renewal, but governance considerations may result in renewals for shorter periods or in respect of less than the maximum permitted number of shares being sought or approved.Irish law also generally provides shareholders with statutory pre-emption rights when new shares are issued for cash. However, it is possible for such statutory pre-emption rights to be dis-applied in a company’s constitution or by a special resolution of shareholders. Such dis-application of pre-emption rights may be given in respect of up to the entirety of a company’s authorized but unissued share capital and for a maximum period of five years, at which point it must be renewed by another special resolution. The Company’s constitution dis-applies statutory pre-emption rights up to the maximum of the Company’s authorized but unissued share capital for a period of five years from March 31, 2020. This dis-application will need to be renewed by special resolution upon its expiration and at periodic intervals thereafter. Under Irish law, a dis-application of statutory pre-emption rights may be given for up to five years at each renewal, but governance considerations may result in renewals for shorter periods or in respect of less than the maximum permitted number of unissued shares being sought or approved.Irish law requires us to have available “distributable profits” to pay dividends to shareholder and generally to make share repurchases and redemptions.Under Irish law, we may only pay dividends and, generally, make share repurchases and redemptions from distributable profits. Distributable profits may be created through the earnings of the Company or other methods (including certain intra-group reorganizations involving the capitalization of the Company’s un-distributable profits and their subsequent reduction). While it is our intention to maintain a sufficient level of distributable profits in order to pay dividends on our ordinary shares and make share repurchases, there is no assurance that the Company will maintain the necessary level of distributable profits to do so"

Risk Factors
 SummaryThe risk factors set forth below reflect risks associated with our businesses and the industries in which we operate generally. Some of the more significant risk factors are summarized below.Risks Related to Our Business•An overall decline in economic and business activity could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of our business. •If our clients are not satisfied with our services, we may face additional cost, loss of profit opportunities, damage to our reputation, or legal liability.10•Revenues from commission arrangements may fluctuate due to many factors, including cyclical or permanent changes in the insurance and reinsurance markets outside of our control.Financial Risks•We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows. Similarly, changes in interest rates and deterioration of credit quality could reduce the value of our cash balances and investment portfolios and adversely affect our financial condition or results.•A decline in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper may adversely affect our borrowing costs, access to capital, and financial flexibility.•Our global effective tax rate is subject to a variety of different factors, which could create volatility in that tax rate, expose us to greater than anticipated tax liabilities, or cause us to adjust previously recognized tax assets and liabilities.•We are a holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends or other payments in needed amounts from our subsidiaries.Legal and Regulatory Risks•We are subject to E&O claims against us as well as other contingencies and legal proceedings, some of which, if determined unfavorably to us, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.•Our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which could reduce our profitability, limit our growth, or subject us to legal and regulatory actions.Operational Risks•Our results of operations have been adversely affected and could be materially adversely affected in the future by the COVID-19 global pandemic.•Our success depends on our ability to retain, attract and develop experienced and qualified personnel, including our senior management team and other professional personnel.Risks Related to Technology, Cybersecurity, and Data Protection•We rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business. Any significant system or network disruption due to a breach in the security of our information technology systems could have a negative impact on our reputation, operations, sales, and operating results.•Improper disclosure of confidential, personal, or proprietary data could result in regulatory scrutiny, legal liability, or harm to our reputation.Risks Related to the Combination•The Combination is subject to customary closing conditions, including conditions related to regulatory approvals, and may not be completed on a timely basis, or at all, or may be completed on a basis that has a material impact on the value of the combined company. Failure to close the Combination could negatively impact our share price and future business and financial results.•While the Combination is pending, we are subject to business uncertainties related to our relationships with employees, clients and suppliers, which could adversely affect our business and operations. These uncertainties could also adversely affect the combined company following the Combination.Risks Related to Being a Non-U.S. Company•We are incorporated in Ireland, and Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the U.S. and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.•As an Irish public limited company, certain capital structure decisions regarding the Company will require the approval of shareholders, which may limit the Company’s flexibility to manage its capital structure.Risk Factors
The risk factors set forth below reflect risks associated with our existing and potential businesses and the industries in which we operate generally and contain “forward-looking statements” as discussed in the “Business” Section of Part I, Item 1 of this report. Readers should consider these risks in addition to the other information contained in this report because our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected if any of these risks were to actually 11occur and the occurrence of such risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in or implied by the forward-looking statements in this document and elsewhere.Risks Related to Our BusinessAn overall decline in economic and business activity could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of our business.The results of our operations are generally affected by the level of business activity of our clients, which in turn is affected by the economy of the industries and markets these clients serve. Economic downturns, volatility, or uncertainty in the broader economy or in specific markets may cause reductions in technology and discretionary spending by our clients, which may result in reductions in the growth of new business or reductions in existing business. If our clients become financially less stable, enter bankruptcy, liquidate their operations or consolidate, our revenues and collectability of receivables could be adversely affected.The demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases, affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our Commercial Risk Solutions, Reinsurance Solutions, and Data and Analytic Service lines. The economic activity that impacts property and casualty insurance is most closely correlated with employment levels, corporate revenues, and asset values. Downward fluctuations in the year-over-year insurance premiums charged by insurers to protect against the same risk, referred to in the industry as softening of the insurance market, could adversely affect these businesses as a significant portion of the earnings are determined as a percentage of premiums charged to our clients. Insolvencies and consolidations associated with an economic downturn, especially insolvencies in the insurance industry, could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business. Also, error and omission claims against us, which we refer to as E&O claims, may increase in economic downturns, also adversely affecting our business.We face significant competitive pressures from traditional and non-traditional competitors that could affect our market share.As a global professional services firm, we compete with global, national, regional, and local insurance companies that market and service their own products, other financial services providers, brokers, and investment managers, independent firms, and consulting organizations affiliated with accounting, information systems, technology, and financial services firms. We compete with respect to service, delivery of insights, product features, price, commission structure, technology, financial strength, ability to access certain insurance markets, and name recognition. Our competitors may have better financial, technical and marketing resources, broader customer bases, greater name recognition, more comprehensive products, stronger presence in certain geographies, or more established relationships with their customers and suppliers than we have.In addition, alliances among competitors or mergers of competitors could affect our market share, and some of our competitors may have or may develop a lower cost structure, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, or provide services that gain greater market acceptance than the services that we offer or develop. Our competitors may be more successful in innovating and delivering services to meet new and existing client needs. Competitors may be able to respond to the need for technological changes, innovate faster, respond better to evolving client demand and industry conditions, or price their services more aggressively than we do. They may also compete for skilled professionals, finance acquisitions, fund internal growth, and compete for market share more effectively than we do. Further, new and non- traditional competitors, our clients’ increasing ability and determination to self-insure, and capital market alternatives to traditional insurance and reinsurance markets cause additional forms of competition and innovation that could affect our market share. This competition is further intensified by an industry trend where clients engage multiple brokers to service different portions of their accounts. If we fail to respond successfully to the to the evolving competition we face, our financial condition or results of operations might be adversely affected.If our clients are not satisfied with our services, we may face additional cost, loss of profit opportunities, damage to our reputation, or legal liability.We depend, to a large extent, on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for high-quality advice and solutions. If a client is not satisfied with our services, it could cause us to incur additional costs and impair profitability, or lose the client relationship altogether. Moreover, if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, we could be subject to legal liability or loss of client relationships.The nature of much of our work involves assumptions and estimates concerning future events, the actual outcome of which we cannot know with certainty in advance. For example, in our investment consulting business, we may be measured based on our track record regarding judgments and advice on investments that are susceptible to influences unknown at the time the advice was given. In addition, we could make computational, software programming, or data entry or management errors. A client may claim it suffered losses due to reliance on our consulting advice, which poses risks of liability exposure and costs of defense and increased insurance premiums. Many of our clients are businesses that actively share information among themselves about the quality of service they receive from their vendors. Accordingly, poor service to one client may negatively impact our relationships with multiple other clients. 12Damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business.We advise our clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, financial condition, and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters or others could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential clients and existing and future employees, which could make it difficult for us to attract new clients and employees and retain existing ones. Negative public opinion could also result from actual or alleged conduct by us or those currently or formerly associated with us. Damage to our reputation could affect the confidence of our clients, rating agencies, regulators, stockholders, employees and third parties in transactions that are important to our business adversely affecting our business, financial condition, and operating results.Revenues from commission arrangements may fluctuate due to many factors, including cyclical or permanent changes in the insurance and reinsurance markets outside of our control.Revenues from commission arrangements have historically been affected by significant fluctuations arising from uncertainties and changes in the industries in which we operate. A significant portion of our revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage. We have no control over premium rates, and our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction. The potential for changes in premium rates is significant, due to pricing cyclicality in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets.In addition to movements in premium rates, our ability to generate premium-based commission revenue may be challenged by:•the growing availability of alternative methods for clients to meet their risk-protection needs, including a greater willingness on the part of corporations to “self-insure,” the use of so-called “captive” insurers, and the development of capital markets-based solutions and other alternative capital sources for traditional insurance and reinsurance needs that increase market capacity, increase competition, and put pressure on pricing;•fluctuation in the need for insurance;•the level of compensation, as a percentage of premium, that insurance carriers are willing to compensate brokers for placement activity;•the growing desire of clients to move away from variable commission rates and instead compensate brokers based upon flat fees, which can negatively impact us as fees are not generally indexed for inflation and do not automatically increase with premium as does commission-based compensation; and•competition from insurers seeking to sell their products directly to consumers, including online sales, without the involvement of an insurance broker•growing number of technology-enabled competitors offering new risk-transfer solutions that eliminate the traditional broker-client relationship in both commercial insurance and reinsurance marketsThe profitability of our consulting engagements with clients may not meet our expectations due to unexpected costs, cost overruns, early contract terminations, unrealized assumptions used in our contract bidding process or the inability to maintain our prices.Our profitability with respect to consulting engagements is highly dependent upon our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency. As we adapt to changes in our business and the market, adapt to the regulatory environment, enter into new engagements, acquire additional businesses, and take on new employees in new locations, we may not be able to manage our large, diverse and changing workforce, control our costs, or improve our efficiency.Our profit margin, and therefore our profitability, is largely a function of the rates we are able to charge for our services and the staffing costs for our personnel. Accordingly, if we are not able to maintain the rates we charge for our services or appropriately manage the staffing costs of our personnel, we may not be able to sustain our profit margin and our profitability will suffer. The prices we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors, including competitive factors, the extent of ongoing clients’ perception of our ability to add value through our services, and general economic conditions. If we cannot drive suitable cost efficiencies, our profit margins will suffer. Our cost efficiencies may also be impacted by factors such as our ability to transition consultants from completed projects to new assignments, our ability to secure new consulting engagements, our ability to forecast demand for consulting services (and, consequently, appropriately manage the size and location of our workforce), employee attrition, and the need to devote time and resources to training and professional and business development.13In our investment consulting business, we advise or act on behalf of clients regarding their investments. The results of these investments are uncertain and subject to numerous factors, some of which are within our control and some which are not. Clients that experience losses or lower than expected investment returns may leave us for competitors and/or assert claims against us.Our investment consulting business provides advice to clients on: investment strategy, which can include advice on setting investment objectives, asset allocation, and hedging strategies; selection (or removal) of investment managers; the investment in different investment instruments and products; and the selection of other investment service providers such as custodians and transition managers. For some clients, we are responsible for making decisions on these matters and we may implement such decisions in a fiduciary or agency capacity without assuming title over the underlying funds or assets invested. Asset classes may experience poor absolute performance and third parties we recommend or select, such as investment managers, may underperform their benchmarks due to poor market performance, negligence, or other reasons, resulting in poor investment returns or losses. These losses may be attributable in whole or in part to failures on our part or to events entirely outside of our control, including but not limited to uncertainty or volatility in financial markets due to economic, political, and regulatory conditions or pandemics. Plaintiffs have, and may continue to, file individual and class action lawsuits alleging investment consultants have charged excessive fees, given improper advice due to conflicts of interest, or recommended investments that underperformed other investments available at the time. Defending against these claims can involve potentially significant costs, including legal defense costs, as well as cause substantial distraction and diversion of other resources. If any lawsuit – against the Company or any other investment consultant – results in a large adverse verdict, the size of the verdict or resultant negative adverse publicity may prompt the filing of additional lawsuits. Furthermore, our ability to limit our potential liability is restricted in certain jurisdictions and in connection with claims involving breaches of fiduciary or agency duties or other alleged errors or omissions.The anticipated benefits of the redomiciliation from the U.K. to Ireland may not be realized.In April 2020, we changed the jurisdiction of incorporation for our parent company from the U.K. to Ireland by means of a scheme of arrangement under English law (the “Reorganization”). At the time of the Reorganization we expected, and we continue to expect, that the Reorganization will, among other things, provide greater certainty around ongoing access to existing U.S. treaties with other EU member countries from which we derive benefit. However, we may not realize the benefits we anticipate from the Reorganization, which could have an adverse effect on our business.Financial RisksWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows.We face exposure to adverse movements in exchange rates of currencies other than our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, as a significant portion of our business is located outside of the U.S. These exposures may change over time, and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. Approximately 55% of our consolidated revenue is non-U.S., attributed on the basis of where the services are performed, and the exposures created can have significant currency volatility. These currency exchange fluctuations create risk in both the translation of the financial results of our global subsidiaries into U.S. dollars for our consolidated financial statements, as well as in those of our operations that receive revenue and incur expenses other than in their respective local currencies, which can reduce the profitability of our operations based on the direction the respective currencies’ exchange rates move. A decrease in the value of certain currencies relative to other currencies could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that benefit to a greater degree from a specific exchange rate move and can, as a result, deliver services at a lower cost or receive greater revenues from such a transaction. Although we use various derivative financial instruments to help protect against certain adverse foreign exchange rate fluctuations, we cannot eliminate such risks, and, as a result, changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results. For example, the strengthening of the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies might adversely affect the value of our products and services when translated to U.S. dollar, even if the value of such products and services has not changed in their original currency.Changes in interest rates and deterioration of credit quality could reduce the value of our cash balances and investment portfolios and adversely affect our financial condition or results.Operating funds available for corporate use were $1,192 million at December 31, 2020 and are reported in Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments. Of the total balance, $102 million was restricted to its use as of December 31, 2020. Funds held on behalf of clients and insurers were $5.7 billion at December 31, 2020 and are reported in Fiduciary assets. We also carry an investment portfolio of other long-term investments. As of December 31, 2020, these long-term investments had a carrying value of $74 million. Adverse changes in interest rates, performance, and counterparty credit quality, including default, could reduce the value of these funds and investments, thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results. We may experience reduced investment earnings on our cash and short-term investments of fiduciary and operating funds if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain at or near their current low levels or fall below their current levels, or if negative yields on deposits or investments are experienced, as we have experienced in Japan and certain jurisdictions in the E.U. On the other hand, higher interest rates could result in a higher discount rate used by investors to value our future cash flows thereby resulting in a lower valuation of the Company. In addition, during times of stress in the banking industry, counterparty risk can quickly escalate, potentially resulting in substantial losses for us as a result of our cash or other investments with such counterparties, as well as substantial losses for our clients and the insurance companies with which we work.14Our pension obligations and value of our pension assets could adversely affect our shareholders’ equity, net income, cash flow, and liquidity.To the extent that the pension obligations associated with our pension plans continue to exceed the fair value of the assets supporting those obligations, our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected. In particular, lower interest rates and investment returns could result in the present value of plan liabilities increasing at a greater rate than the value of plan assets, resulting in higher unfunded positions in our pension plans. In addition, the periodic revision of pension assumptions or variances of actual results from our assumptions can materially change the present value of expected future benefits, and therefore the funded status of the plans and resulting net periodic pension expense. As a result, we may experience future changes in the funded status of our plans that could require us to make additional cash contributions beyond those that have been estimated and which could adversely affect shareholders’ equity, net income, cash flow and liquidity.Our worldwide pension plans are significant, and therefore our pension contributions and expense are sensitive to various market, demographic, and other factors. These factors include equity and bond market returns, fair value of pension assets, the assumed interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities, foreign exchange rates, rates of inflation, mortality assumptions, potential regulatory and legal changes or developments, and counterparty exposure from various investments and derivative contracts, including annuities. Variations or developments in connection with any of these factors could cause significant changes to our financial position and results of operations from year to year. In addition, contributions are generally based on statutory requirements and local funding practices, which may differ from measurements under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”).We have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility.As of December 31, 2020, we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately $7.7 billion. The level of debt outstanding could adversely affect our financial flexibility by reducing our ability to use cash from operations for other purposes, including working capital, dividends to shareholders, share repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. We also are subject to risks that, at the time any of our outstanding debt matures, we will not be able to retire or refinance the debt on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.As of December 31, 2020, we had two committed credit facilities outstanding. Each of these facilities is intended to support our commercial paper obligations and our general working capital needs. In addition, each of these facilities included customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios of adjusted consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense and consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated EBITDA, tested quarterly.A substantial portion of our outstanding debt, including certain intercompany debt obligations, contains financial and other covenants. The terms of these covenants may limit our ability to obtain, or increase the costs of obtaining, additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or general corporate requirements. This in turn may have the impact of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, thereby placing us at a relative disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness, or fewer or less onerous covenants associated with such indebtedness, and making us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions.If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity, or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments, and alliances, any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business. Additionally, we may not be able to take such actions or refinance any of our debt, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.A decline in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper may adversely affect our borrowing costs, access to capital, and financial flexibility.A downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper could increase our borrowing costs, reduce or eliminate our access to capital, reduce our financial flexibility, and limit our ability to implement on corporate strategy. Our senior debt ratings at December 31, 2020 were A- with a stable outlook (Standard & Poor’s, or “S&P”), BBB+ with a negative outlook (Fitch, Inc., or “Fitch”), and Baa2 with a stable outlook (Moody’s Investor Services, or “Moody’s”). Our commercial paper ratings were A-2 (S&P), F-2 (Fitch) and P-2 (Moody’s).Real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect any trading market for, or trading value of, our securities. Such changes could result from any number of factors, including the modification by a credit rating agency of the criteria or methodology it applies to particular issuers, a change in the agency’s view of us (currently or as a combined company after the closing of the transaction with WTW) or our industry, or as a consequence of actions we take to implement our corporate strategies. A change in our credit rating could adversely limit our access to capital and our competitive position.Our global effective tax rate is subject to a variety of different factors, which could create volatility in that tax rate, expose us to greater than anticipated tax liabilities or cause us to adjust previously recognized tax assets and liabilities.We are, and anticipate we will be, subject to income taxes in Ireland, the U.K., the U.S. and many other jurisdictions. As a result, our global effective tax rate from period to period can be affected by many factors, including changes in tax legislation or regulations, the continuing development of regulations and other governmental action that affect the application of such legislation, our global mix of earnings, the use of global funding structures, the tax characteristics of our income, the effect of 15complying with transfer pricing requirements under laws of many different countries on our revenues and costs, the consequences of acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and business segments. In addition, we could be subject to increased taxation as a result of changes in eligibility for the benefits of current income tax treaties between and among Ireland, the U.K., the U.S and other countries, including any future amendments to the current income tax treaties between and among such countries, or any new statutory or regulatory provisions that might limit our ability to take advantage of any such treaties. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes, and our determination of the amount of our tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities. Our actual global tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material.We are, and anticipate we will be, subject to tax audits conducted by Ireland, the U.K., the U.S., and other tax authorities, and the resolution of such audits could impact our tax rate in future periods, as would any reclassification or other changes (such as those in applicable accounting rules) that increases the amounts we have provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements. The tax laws and regulations in Ireland, the U.K., the U.S., and the other tax jurisdictions in which the we operate are inherently complex, and we will be obligated to make judgments and interpretations about the application of these laws and regulations to our operations and businesses. The interpretation and application of these laws and regulations could be challenged by the relevant governmental authorities, which could result in administrative or judicial procedures, actions or sanctions, which could be material. There can be no assurance that we would be successful in attempting to mitigate the adverse impacts resulting from any changes in tax laws and regulations, including any changes in the interpretation of such tax authorities, or from audits and other matters. Our inability to mitigate the negative consequences of such actions could cause our global effective tax rate to increase, our use of cash to increase and our financial condition and results of operations to suffer.The global effective tax rate that will apply subsequent to Brexit might become uncertain and may vary from expectations.As further discussed below, on January 31, 2020, the U.K. withdrew as a member of the E.U., commonly referred to as Brexit, and the UK has since ratified a trade and cooperation agreement governing its future relationship with the E.U., which is being applied provisionally from January 1, 2021 until it is also ratified by the European Parliament and the Council of the E.U. The changes (which are ongoing) in applicable law and regulatory oversight of our operations caused by Brexit in the U.K. and the member states of the E.U. will impact how we conduct business in the U.K., within the E.U., and between the U.K. and the E.U., which may result in changes in the countries in which we derive a portion of our global earnings. As a result, our actual global effective tax rate may vary from expectations and that variance may be material as a result of Brexit. Changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements. We are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, those relating to revenue recognition, pensions, recoverability of assets including customer receivables, valuation of goodwill and intangibles, contingencies, share-based payments, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances. These assumptions and estimates involve the exercise of judgment and discretion, which may evolve over time in light of operational experience, regulatory direction, developments or changes in accounting principles or standards, and other factors. Actual results could differ from these estimates, or changes in assumptions, estimates, policies, or developments in the business may change our initial estimates, which could materially affect the Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Financial Position, Shareholders’ Equity, and Cash Flows.We may be required to record goodwill or other long-lived asset impairment charges, which could result in a significant charge to earnings.Under U.S. GAAP, we review our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or other long-lived assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our share price or market capitalization, reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry. We may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or other long- lived assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and other long-lived assets. Future goodwill or other long-lived asset impairment charges could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.We are a holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends or other payments in needed amounts from our subsidiaries.The Company is organized as a holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating entities. As a holding company without significant operations of its own, our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our subsidiaries. We rely on dividends, interest, and other payments from these subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying 16principal and interest on outstanding debt, paying dividends to shareholders, repurchasing ordinary shares, and corporate expenses. Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate or other restrictions that may limit the amounts that subsidiaries can pay in dividends or other payments to us. No assurance can be given that there will not be further changes in law, regulatory actions, or other circumstances that could restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise make payments to us. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that our subsidiaries may be able to make timely payments to us in order for us to meet our obligations.Legal and Regulatory RisksWe are subject to E&O claims against us as well as other contingencies and legal proceedings, some of which, if determined unfavorably to us, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.We assist our clients with various matters, including advising on and placing insurance and reinsurance coverage and handling related claims, consulting on various human resources matters, and providing actuarial, investment consulting, and asset management services. E&O claims against us may allege our potential liability for damages arising from these services. E&O claims could include, for example, the failure of our employees or sub-agents, whether negligently or intentionally, to place coverage correctly or notify carriers of claims on behalf of clients, to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured, or the failure to give error-free consulting or investment advice. It is not always possible to prevent and detect E&O, and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases. In addition, we are subject to other types of claims, litigation, and proceedings in the ordinary course of business, which along with E&O claims, may seek damages, including punitive damages, in amounts that could, if awarded, have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, earnings, and cash flows. In addition to potential liability for monetary damages, such claims or outcomes could harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business.We have historically purchased, and intend to continue to purchase, insurance to cover E&O claims and other insurance to provide protection against certain losses that arise in such matters. However, we have exhausted or materially depleted our coverage under some of the policies that protect us for certain years and, consequently, are self-insured or materially self-insured for some historical claims. Additionally, parts or all of an E&O claim could fall within insurance deductibles, self-insured retentions, or policy exclusions. Accruals for these exposures, and related insurance receivables, when applicable, have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable. These accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as developments warrant and may also be adversely affected by disputes we may have with our insurers over coverage. Amounts related to settlement provisions are recorded in Other general expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Discussion of some of these claims, lawsuits, and proceedings are contained in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.In addition, we provide a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to our customers and others. In the event of a default, our potential exposure is equal to the amount of the guarantee or indemnification.The ultimate outcome of claims, lawsuits, proceedings, guarantees and indemnifications cannot be ascertained, and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us. It is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters.Our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which could reduce our profitability, limit our growth, or subject us to legal and regulatory actions.Our businesses are subject to extensive legal and regulatory oversight throughout the world, including the Irish Companies Act, the U.S. securities laws, rules, and regulations, the rules and regulations promulgated by the FCA and a variety of other laws, rules, and regulations addressing, among other things, licensing, data privacy and protection, trade sanctions laws, restrictions and export controls, anti-money laundering, wage-and-hour standards, employment and labor relations, anti-competition, anti-corruption, currency, reserves, government contracting, and the amount of local investment with respect to our operations in certain countries. This legal and regulatory oversight could reduce our profitability or limit our growth by: increasing the costs of legal and regulatory compliance; limiting or restricting the products or services we sell, the markets we serve or enter, the methods by which we sell our products and services, the overall structure of our business units, the type of services and prices we can charge for our services, or the form of compensation we can accept from our clients, carriers, and third parties; or by subjecting our businesses to the possibility of legal and regulatory actions, proceedings, or fines.The global nature of our operations increases the complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations adding to our cost of doing business. In addition, many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions, increasing the complexity and cost of compliance. In emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less developed legal systems, local laws and regulations may not be established with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us adequate assurance that we are operating our business in a compliant manner with all required licenses or that our rights are otherwise protected. In addition, certain laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance provisions of the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act in the U.S., and the Bribery Act of 2010 in the U.K., impact our operations outside of the legislating country by imposing requirements for the conduct of overseas operations, and in several cases, requiring compliance by foreign subsidiaries.In addition to the complexity of the laws and regulations themselves, the development of new laws and regulations or changes in application or interpretation of current laws and regulations or conflict between them also increases our legal and regulatory compliance complexity. Additionally, our acquisitions of new businesses and our continued operational changes and entry into new jurisdictions and new service offerings increases our legal and regulatory compliance complexity, as well as the 17type of governmental oversight to which we may be subject. Changes in laws and regulations could mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions, impose additional licensure requirements or costs to our operations and services, or cause us to cease offering certain services or solutions. Furthermore, as we enter new jurisdictions or businesses and further develop and expand our services, including through acquisitions, we may become subject to additional types of laws and governmental oversight and supervision, such as those applicable to the financial lending or other service institutions. Regulatory developments that could result in changes that adversely affect us or cause us to change our business or operations include: additional requirements respecting data privacy, data security, and data usage in jurisdictions in which we operate that may increase our costs of compliance and potentially reduce the manner in which we can use data; changes in tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate; regulatory actions or changes that require us to change our compensation model; or additional regulations promulgated by , regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which we operate.In all jurisdictions, the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities. Generally, such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant, renew, and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations. Accordingly, we may have a license revoked or be unable to obtain new licenses and therefore be precluded or suspended from carrying on or developing some or all of our activities or otherwise fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction. No assurances can be given that our business can further develop or continue to be conducted in any given jurisdiction in the future as it has been conducted in the past. Changes in the regulatory scheme, or even changes in how existing regulations are interpreted, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations by limiting revenue streams or increasing costs of compliance. Our business’ regulatory oversight also includes licensing of insurance brokers and agents, managing general agency or general underwriting operations, and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Our continuing ability to provide insurance broking in the jurisdictions in which we operate depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions. Also, we can be affected indirectly by the governmental regulation and supervision of insurance companies. For instance, if we are providing or managing general underwriting services for an insurer, we may have to contend with regulations affecting our client.Services provided in our Health Solutions and Retirement Solutions service lines are also the subject of ever-evolving government regulation, either because the services provided to our clients are regulated directly or because third parties upon whom we rely to provide services to clients are regulated, thereby indirectly affecting the manner in which we provide services to those clients. In particular, our health care exchange business depends upon the private sector of the U.S. insurance system and its role in financing health care delivery, and insurance carriers’ use and payment of commissions to agents, brokers, and other organizations to market and sell individual and family health insurance products and plans. Uncertainty regarding, or any changes to, state or federal law, or the interpretation of such law by applicable regulatory agencies could delay client adoption of our health care exchanges, impair our ability to retain clients who have adopted our health care exchanges, or cause insurance carriers to alter or eliminate the products and plans that they offer or attempt to move members into new products or plans for which we receive lower commissions. In addition, changes in laws, government regulations, or the way those regulations are interpreted in the jurisdictions in which we operate could affect the viability, value, use, or delivery of benefits and human resources programs, including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans (such as medical), defined contribution plans (such as 401(k)), or defined benefit plans (such as pension), may adversely affect the demand for, or profitability of, our services.If we violate the laws and regulations to which we are subject, we could be subject to fines, penalties, or criminal sanctions and could be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate these laws and regulations, causing an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.Heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny may lead to additional regulatory investigations, increased government involvement, or enforcement actions, which could consume significant management time and resources and could have adverse effects on our business and operations. For instance, increased scrutiny by competition authorities may increase our costs of doing business or force us to change the way we conduct business or refrain from or otherwise alter the way we engage in certain activities. Additionally, we could suffer significant financial or reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest, which exist or could exist any time we or any of our employees have or may have an interest in a transaction or engagement that is inconsistent with our clients’ interests. This could occur, for example, when we are providing services to multiple parties in connection with a transaction. We also provide services to advise and assist in satisfying all our clients’ needs from all our businesses, creating a greater potential for conflicts with advisory services.Due to the broad scope of our businesses and our client base, we regularly address potential conflicts of interest, including, without limitation, situations where our services to a particular client or our own investments or other interests conflict, or are perceived to conflict, with the interests of another client. If these are not adequately identified and managed, this could then lead to failure or perceived failure to protect the client’s interests, with consequential regulatory and reputational risks, including litigation or enforcement actions that could adversely affect us and our operations. Identifying conflicts of interest may also prove particularly difficult as we continue to bring systems and information together and integrate newly acquired businesses. In addition, we may not be able to adequately address such conflicts of interest.Insurance intermediaries have traditionally been remunerated by base commissions paid by insurance carriers in respect of insurance placements for clients, or by fees paid by clients. Intermediaries also obtain other revenue from insurance carriers. This revenue, when derived from carriers in their capacity as insurance markets (as opposed to as corporate clients of the 18intermediaries where they may be purchasing insurance or reinsurance or other non-market related services), is commonly known as market derived income (“MDI”). MDI is another example of an area in which potential conflicts of interest may arise. This revenue may be subject to scrutiny by various regulators under conflict of interest, anti-trust, unfair competition, conduct and anti-bribery laws and regulations. MDI takes a variety of forms, including volume- or profit-based contingent commissions, facilities administration charges, business development agreements, and fees for providing consulting services to carriers. While accepting MDI is a lawful and acceptable business practice, we cannot predict whether our position will result in regulatory or other scrutiny and our controls may not be fully effective. Failure to protect our intellectual property rights, or allegations that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others, could harm our reputation, ability to compete effectively, and financial condition.To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on a combination of trademark laws, copyright laws, patent laws, trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements, and other contractual arrangements with our affiliates, employees, clients, strategic partners, and others, as well as internal policies and procedures regarding our management of intellectual property. However, the protective steps that we take may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Further, we operate in many jurisdictions and effective trademark, copyright, patent, and trade secret protection may not be available or adequate in every country or jurisdiction in which we offer our services or employ our colleagues. Additionally, our competitors may develop products similar to our products that do not conflict with our related intellectual property rights. Failure to protect our intellectual property adequately could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively.In addition, to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, we may initiate litigation against third parties, such as infringement suits or interference proceedings. Third parties may assert intellectual property rights claims against us, which may be costly to defend, could require the payment of damages, and could limit our ability to use or offer certain technologies, products, or other intellectual property. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be expensive, take significant time and divert management’s attention from other business concerns. Successful challenges against us could require us to modify or discontinue our use of technology or business processes where such use is found to infringe or violate the rights of others, or require us to purchase licenses from third parties, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.Operational RisksOur results of operations have been adversely affected and could be materially adversely affected in the future by the COVID-19 global pandemic.The COVID-19 global pandemic has created significant public health concerns and significant volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption in every region where we operate.A number of evolving factors related to the global pandemic and the post-pandemic recovery period may influence the duration, nature and extent of the impact on our business and financial results. Such factors include worldwide macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates, employment rates, consumer confidence and spending, gross domestic product, property values, and changes in client behavior, and foreign exchange rates in each of the markets in which we operate; business closures; changes in laws, regulations (including those changes that may provide for extended premium payment terms), and guidance; court decisions and litigation trends; a decline in business and the ability of counterparties to pay for our services on time or at all; an increased number of E&O claims in those areas impacted by the pandemic, as well as an increase in the incidence or severity of E&O claims against us and our market partners; our ability to sell and provide our services, including due to the impact of travel restrictions, lockdowns, quarantines, social distancing, and alternative work arrangements; the health of, and the effect of the pandemic on, our employees; political disruption; potential effects on our internal controls and risk mitigation processes, including those over financial reporting, as a result of changes in working environments for our employees and business partners; resurgences of spread; identification of new, more contagious variants of the virus; resulting “lockdowns,” government restrictions or recommendations; and uncertainties in vaccine manufacturing, accessibility and adoption.In addition, the continuing COVID-19 pandemic may again create significant disruptions in the credit or financial markets, or impact our credit ratings, which could adversely affect our ability to access capital on favorable terms or at all. Finally, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may heighten other risks discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and stock price.The economic and political conditions of the countries and regions in which we operate could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity, and prospects for growth.Our operations in countries undergoing political change or experiencing economic instability are subject to uncertainty and risks that could materially adversely affect our business. These risks include, particularly in emerging markets, the possibility we would be subject to undeveloped or evolving legal systems, unstable governments and economies, and potential governmental actions affecting the flow of goods, services, and currency.Furthermore, the U.K. formally withdrew from the E.U., commonly referred to as Brexit, and ratified a trade cooperation agreement governing its future relationship with the E.U. The agreement, which is being applied provisionally from January 1, 2021 until it is ratified by the European Parliament and the Council of the E.U., addresses trade, economic arrangements, law 19enforcement, judicial cooperation and a governance framework including procedures for dispute resolution, among other things. Because the agreement merely sets forth a framework in many respects and will require complex additional bilateral negotiations between the U.K. and the E.U. as both parties continue to work on the rules for implementation, significant political and economic uncertainty remains. We have significant operations and a substantial workforce within the country, and we enjoy certain benefits based on the U.K.’s membership in the E.U., and the lack of clarity around the future relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. creates uncertainty that may have a material impact on our business and operations. We may also be required to incur additional expense as we adapt to and create the ability to operate within the new political and regulatory environment. Additionally, any development that has the effect of devaluing the euro or British pound could meaningfully reduce the value of our assets and reduce the usefulness of liquidity alternatives denominated in that currency such as our multicurrency U.S. credit facility. We also deposit some of our cash, including cash held in a fiduciary capacity, with certain European financial institutions. While we continuously monitor and manage exposures associated with those deposits, to the extent the uncertainty surrounding economic stability in Europe and the future viability of the euro suddenly and adversely impacts those financial institutions, some or all of those cash deposits could be at risk.Our success depends on our ability to retain, attract and develop experienced and qualified personnel, including our senior management team and other professional personnel.We depend, in material part, upon the members of our senior management team who possess extensive knowledge and a deep understanding of our business and our strategy, as well as the colleagues who are critical to developing and retaining client relationships. The unexpected loss of services of any of these senior leaders could have a disruptive effect adversely impacting our ability to manage our business effectively and execute our business strategy. Competition for experienced professional personnel is intense, and we are constantly working to retain, attract and develop these professionals. If we cannot successfully do so, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. While we have plans for key management succession and long-term compensation plans designed to retain our senior management team and critical colleagues, if our succession plans and retention programs do not operate effectively, our business could be adversely affected. We also are committed to diversity and inclusion and strive to maintain an equitable work environment that unlocks the full potential of all of our personnel. If we are unsuccessful in maintaining such a work environment, we could experience difficulty attracting and retaining personnel, which could have a negative impact on our business.Our global operations expose us to various international risks that could adversely affect our business.Our operations are conducted globally. Accordingly, we are subject to regulatory, legal, economic, and market risks associated with operating in, and sourcing from, foreign countries, including:•difficulties in staffing and managing our foreign offices, including due to unexpected wage inflation or job turnover, and the increased travel, infrastructure, and legal and compliance costs and risks associated with multiple international locations;•hyperinflation in certain foreign countries;•conflicting regulations in the countries in which we do business;•imposition of investment requirements or other restrictions by foreign governments;•longer payment cycles;•greater difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;•insufficient demand for our services in foreign jurisdictions;•our ability to execute effective and efficient cross-border sourcing of services on behalf of our clients;•the reliance on or use of third parties to perform services on behalf of the Company;•disparate tax regimes;•restrictions on the import and export of technologies; and•trade barriers.The occurrence of natural or man-made disasters could result in declines in business and increases in claims that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We are exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes, extreme weather, or other climate events; pandemic health events, and man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism, civil unrest, violence, military actions, and cyber-terrorism. The continued threat of terrorism and other events or disasters may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, and a natural or man-made disaster could trigger energy shortages, public health issues, or an economic downturn or instability in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster. These 20consequences could, among other things, result in a decline in business and increased claims from those areas. They could also result in reduced underwriting capacity, making it more difficult for our professionals to place business. Disasters also could disrupt public and private infrastructure, including communications and financial services, which could disrupt our normal business operations.A natural or man-made disaster also could disrupt the operations of our counterparties or result in increased prices for the products and services they provide to us. In addition, a disaster could adversely affect the value of the assets in our investment portfolio. Finally, a natural or man-made disaster could increase the incidence or severity of E&O claims against us.Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, or legal liability.Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our personnel, offices, and technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations. Should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as a security incident or attack, a natural disaster, climate event, terrorist attack, pandemic, power loss, telecommunications failure, or other natural or man-made disaster, our continued success will depend, in part, on the availability of our personnel and office facilities, and the proper functioning of computer systems, telecommunications, and other related systems and operations. In events like these, while our operational size, the multiple locations from which we operate, and our existing back-up systems provide us with some degree of flexibility, we still can experience near-term operational challenges in particular areas of our operations. We could potentially lose access to key executives, personnel, or client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario. A disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions, or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships, or legal liability.We rely on third parties to perform key functions of our business operations enabling our provision of services to our clients. These third parties may act in ways that could harm our business.We rely on third parties, and in some cases subcontractors, to provide services, data, and information such as technology, information security, funds transfers, data processing, support functions, and administration that are critical to the operations of our business. These third parties include correspondents, agents and other brokerage and intermediaries, insurance markets, data providers, plan trustees, payroll service providers, benefits administrators, software and system vendors, health plan providers, investment managers, and providers of human resources, among others. As we do not fully control the actions of these third parties, we are subject to the risk that their decisions, actions, or inactions may adversely impact us and replacing these service providers could create significant delay and expense. A failure by third parties to comply with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements in a high quality and timely manner, particularly during periods of our peak demand for their services, could result in economic and reputational harm to us. In addition, we face risks as we transition from in-house functions to third- party support functions and providers that there may be disruptions in service or other unintended results that may adversely affect our business operations. These third parties face their own technology, operating, business, and economic risks, and any significant failures by them, including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client, employee, or company information, could cause harm to our business and reputation. An interruption in or the cessation of service by any service provider as a result of systems failures, cybersecurity incidents, capacity constraints, financial difficulties, or for any other reason could disrupt our operations, impact our ability to offer certain products and services, and result in contractual or regulatory penalties, liability claims from clients, or employees, damage to our reputation, and harm to our business.Our business is exposed to risks associated with the handling of client funds.Certain of our businesses collect premiums from insureds and remits the premiums to the respective insurers. We also collect claims or refunds from insurers on behalf of insureds, which are then remitted to the insureds. Consequently, at any given time, we may be holding and managing funds of our clients. This function creates a risk of loss arising from, among other things, fraud by employees or third parties, execution of unauthorized transactions, errors relating to transaction processing, or other cybersecurity events or security breaches. We are also potentially at risk in the event the financial institution in which we hold these funds suffers any kind of insolvency or liquidity event. The occurrence of any of these types of events in connection with this function could cause us financial loss and reputational harm.In connection with the implementation of our corporate strategies and initiatives, we face risks associated with, among others, the acquisition or disposition of businesses, the integration and development of acquired businesses, and the entry into new lines of business or products.In pursuing our corporate strategy, we often acquire other businesses or dispose of or exit businesses we currently own and we routinely are actively engaged in the process of identifying, analyzing, and negotiating possible transactions. The success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate acquisition and disposition targets, negotiate transactions on favorable terms, complete transactions and, in the case of acquisitions, successfully integrate them into our existing businesses and culture. If a proposed transaction is not consummated, the time and resources spent pursuing it could adversely result in missed opportunities to locate and acquire other businesses. If acquisitions are made, there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, including, but not limited to, revenue growth, operational efficiencies, or expected synergies, and we could incur unexpected costs in connection with integration. If we dispose of or otherwise exit 21certain businesses, there can be no assurance that we will not incur certain disposition related charges, we will be able to reduce overhead related to the divested assets, or will realized the intended benefits of the disposition.We may enter new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business either through acquisitions or through initiatives to generate organic revenue growth. These new lines of business, products, and services present the Company with additional risks, particularly in instances where the markets are new or not fully developed. Such risks include the investment of significant time and resources; the possibility that these efforts will be not be successful; the possibility that the marketplace does not accept our products or services or that we are unable to retain clients that adopt our new products or services; and the risk of new or additional liabilities associated with these efforts. In addition, many of the businesses that we acquire and develop will likely have significantly smaller scales of operations prior to the implementation of our growth strategy. If we are not able to manage the growing complexity of these businesses, including improving, refining, or revising our systems and operational practices, and enlarging the scale and scope of the businesses, our business may be adversely affected. Other risks include developing knowledge of and experience in the new business, product or service, integrating the acquired business into our systems and culture, recruiting and retaining experienced professionals, and developing and capitalizing on new relationships with experienced market participants. External factors, such as compliance with new or revised regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business, products, or services. Failure to manage these risks in the acquisition or development of new businesses could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in connection with the sale of the Divested Business.On May 1, 2017, the Company completed the sale of the benefits administration and business process outsourcing business (the “Divested Business) to an entity controlled by affiliates of The Blackstone Group L.P. (the “Buyer”). This transaction carries inherent risks, including the risk that we will not earn the $500 million of additional consideration or otherwise realize the intended value of the transaction. Risks Related to Technology, Cybersecurity, and Data ProtectionWe rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business. Any significant system or network disruption due to a breach in the security of our information technology systems could have a negative impact on our reputation, operations, sales, and operating results.We rely on the efficient, uninterrupted, and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks, some of which are within the Company and some of which are outsourced to third parties. All information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including but not limited to cyber-attacks, computer viruses, security breaches, and unauthorized access or improper actions by insiders or employees. We are at risk of attack by a growing list of adversaries through new and increasingly sophisticated methods of attack, including methods that take advantage of remote work scenarios due to COVID-19. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, implement adequate preventative measures, or detect and respond quickly enough in the event of an incident or attack. We regularly experience social engineering attempts, attacks to our systems and networks and have from time to time experienced cybersecurity incidents, such as computer viruses, unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems, data loss via malicious and non-malicious methods, and similar incidents, which to date have not had a material impact on our business. If we are unable to efficiently and effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards, we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access. Problems with the information technology systems of vendors, including breakdowns or other disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, difficulties in the migration of services or data to third parties or the cloud hosted by third parties, cyber-attacks, and security breaches could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to customers and otherwise conduct business. Additionally, we are a global and acquisitive organization and we therefore might not adequately identify weaknesses in certain of our information systems, including those of targets we acquire, which could expose us to unexpected liabilities and fines or make our own systems more vulnerable to attack. These types of incidents affecting us or our third-party vendors could result in intellectual property or other confidential information being lost or stolen, including client or employee personal information or company data.We have implemented various measures to manage our risks related to system and network security and disruptions, but a security breach or a significant or extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems could damage our reputation, cause us to lose clients, adversely impact our operations, sales, and operating results, and require us to incur significant expense and divert resources to address and remediate or otherwise resolve such issues. Additionally, in order to maintain the level of security, service, and reliability that our clients require, we may be required to make significant additional investments in our information technology system.Improper disclosure of confidential, personal, or proprietary data could result in regulatory scrutiny, legal liability, or harm to our reputation.One of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our employees’ and clients’ confidential and proprietary information, including confidential information about our clients’ and employees’ compensation, medical information, and other personally identifiable information. We maintain policies, procedures, and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information. Nonetheless, we cannot eliminate the risk of human error, 22employee or vendor malfeasance, or cyber-attacks that could result in improper access to or disclosure of confidential, personal, or proprietary information. Such access or disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws and regulations that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs, fines, loss of revenue, and loss of clients. The release of confidential information as a result of a security breach could also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals or business partners, or by regulators, and the outcome of such proceedings, which could include penalties or fines, could have a significant negative impact on our business.In many jurisdictions, including in the E.U. and the U.S., we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the collection, use, retention, security, and transfer of this information. These laws and regulations are frequently changing and are becoming increasingly complex and sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services both in terms of substance and in terms of enforceability. This makes compliance challenging and expensive. Additionally, certain jurisdictions’ regulations include notice provisions that may require us to inform affected clients or employees in the event of a breach of confidential information before we fully understand or appreciate the extent of the breach. These notice provisions present operational challenges and related risk. In particular, in 2020 there have been a number of new privacy laws around the globe including Brazil, California, South Africa and Dubai. We have had to implement new requirements set out in these laws within our business before the effective date causing distraction from other aspects of our business. Additionally the US Privacy Shield was invalidated by the EU causing significant uncertainty for business transferring personal data from the EU to the US. New guidance issued to firms will require time to implement and may require significant effort to review and effect applicable changes to IT systems and transfer methods. Non-compliance with new and existing laws could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others and additional costs in connection therewith. We expect additional jurisdictions to continue to adopt new privacy regulations and there to be amendments to existing regulations as governments continue to legislate in respect of personal data. We have and will continue to incur expenses and devote resources to bring our practices into compliance with these regulations and future regulations. Our failure to comply with or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability, result in proceedings or fines against us by governmental entities or others, or impair our reputation in the marketplace. Further, regulatory initiatives in the area of data protection are more frequently including provisions allowing authorities to impose substantial fines and penalties, and therefore, failure to comply could also have a significant financial impact.Our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to develop and implement technology-based solutions to support our business operations or if we are not able to effectively drive value for our clients through innovation and technology-based solutions. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to enhance and implement the technology systems necessary to operate our businesses and to achieve intended efficiencies and improvements. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to rapid and continuing changes in technology, industry standards and client preferences. The effort to gain technological expertise, develop new technologies in our business, and achieve internal efficiencies through technology require us to incur significant expenses. We also make investments in technology-based solutions, including data and analytics solutions, for our clients. If we cannot innovate as quickly as our competitors, if our competitors develop more cost-effective technologies, or if our ideas are not accepted in the marketplace, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and complete client engagements. For example, we have invested significantly in the development of our proprietary data and analytics tools including repositories of global insurance and reinsurance placement information, which we use to drive results for our clients in the insurance and reinsurance placement process. Our competitors are developing competing data and analytics tools, and their success in this space may impact our ability to differentiate our services to our clients through the use of unique technological solutions. Innovations in software, cloud computing, data and analytics or other technologies that alter how our services are delivered could significantly undermine our investment in the business if we are slow to innovate or unable to take advantage of these developments.Risks Related to the CombinationThe Combination is subject to customary closing conditions, including conditions related to regulatory approvals, and may not be completed on a timely basis, or at all, or may be completed on a basis that has a material impact on the value of the combined company.The closing of the pending combination of the Combination is subject to a number of customary conditions, and there can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the Combination will be satisfied or waived (to the extent applicable). The failure to satisfy the required conditions could delay the closing of the Combination for a significant period of time or prevent the closing of the Combination from occurring at all. These closing conditions include, among others, the approval of the scheme by the Irish High Court and certain antitrust related clearances, including under the Hart–Scott–Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act (the “HSR Act”), the European Commission Merger Regulation and the antitrust laws of the other required antitrust jurisdictions. The governmental agencies from which the parties will seek certain approvals related to these conditions have broad discretion in administering the applicable governing regulations. As a condition to their approval of the Combination, agencies may impose requirements, limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined company’s business after the closing of the Combination. Such requirements, limitations, costs or restrictions could delay or 23prevent the closing of the Combination or have a material adverse effect on the combined company’s business and results of operations following the closing of the Combination.In addition, the closing conditions include other legal and regulatory conditions, such as (i) the sanction by the Irish High Court of the scheme and the delivery of the court order to the Irish Registrar of Companies, (ii) the approval by the NYSE of the listing of all of our Class A ordinary shares to be issued in connection with the scheme and (iii) the absence of any law or order that restrains, enjoins, makes illegal or otherwise prohibits the closing of the Combination.The Combination is also subject to other customary closing conditions, including: (i) the Business Combination Agreement not having been terminated in accordance with its terms; (ii) the accuracy of each party’s representations and warranties made in the Business Combination Agreement, subject to specified materiality standards; (iii) the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to each party since March 9, 2020; and (iv) the performance and compliance by each party of all of its obligations and compliance with all of its covenants under the Business Combination Agreement in all material respects. There can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the Combination will be satisfied or waived or that the Combination will be completed within the expected time frame, or at all.In addition, if the Combination is not completed by March 9, 2021 (or June 9, 2021 or September 9, 2021, if extended under the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, if applicable, or such earlier date as may be specified by the Irish Takeover Panel), either we or WTW may choose not to proceed with the Combination. The parties can mutually decide to terminate the Business Combination Agreement at any time.Failure to close the Combination could negatively impact our share price and future business and financial results.If the Combination is not completed for any reason, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the potential benefits of having closed the Combination, we will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:•we will be required to pay certain costs and expenses relating to the Combination;•if the Business Combination Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, we may be obligated to reimburse certain Combination expenses of WTW or, if terminated under other circumstances related to a failure to obtain the required antitrust clearances, pay to WTW a termination fee equal to $1 billion;•we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on the market price of our securities;•the manner in which clients, vendors, business partners and other third parties perceive us may be negatively impacted, which in turn could affect our ability to compete for new business or to obtain renewals in the marketplace;•matters relating to the Combination (including integration planning) may require substantial commitments of time and resources by management, which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us;•the Business Combination Agreement restricts us, without WTW’s consent and subject to certain exceptions, from making certain acquisitions and taking other specified actions until the Combination occurs or the Business Combination Agreement terminates. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities and making other business changes to our business that may arise prior to the closing of the Combination or the termination of the Business Combination Agreement; and•we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to close the Combination or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the Business Combination Agreement.If the Combination does not close, these risks may materialize and may adversely affect our business, financial results and share price.While the Combination is pending, we are subject to business uncertainties related to our relationships with employees, clients and suppliers, which could adversely affect our business and operations. These uncertainties could also adversely affect the combined company following the Combination.Uncertainty about the effect of the Combination on employees, clients and suppliers may have an adverse effect on us and, consequently, on the combined company. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the closing of the Combination and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause clients, suppliers and others who deal with us to seek to delay or defer business decisions, to change or terminate existing business relationships with us, or for potential clients to choose other partners instead of us or to take other actions as a result of the Combination that could negatively impact the combined company’s and/or our revenues, earnings, cash flows and the market price of our securities. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the Combination because employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. If, despite our retention efforts, key employees 24depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company, the combined company’s business could be harmed and its ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Combination could be adversely affected. Further, uncertainty around the timing of the closing may heighten risk of employee attritionIf completed, the Combination may not achieve its intended results.We entered into the Business Combination Agreement with the expectation that the Combination would result in various benefits, including, among other things, synergies at the combined company, a comprehensive and more innovative product portfolio, diversified growth profile and broad geographic reach. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the Combination is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether our and WTW’s businesses can be integrated in an efficient and effective manner. Failure to achieve, a delay in achieving, or an increase in the costs to achieve, these anticipated benefits, in whole or in part, could result in increased costs or decreases in expected revenues and could adversely affect the combined company’s future business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Additionally, if any governmental agencies, in connection with the Combination, require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined company’s business after the closing of the Combination, such requirements or restrictions could reduce the anticipated benefits of the Combination.We and WTW may be unable to successfully integrate their operations. Failure to successfully integrate our and WTW’s businesses in the expected timeframe may adversely affect the future results of the combined company.Our and WTW’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Combination will depend, to a large extent, on the ability to integrate our and WTW’s business. The combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. As a result, significant management attention and resources will be devoted to integrating our and WTW’s business practices and operations. The integration process may disrupt the businesses and, if implemented ineffectively, would preclude realization of the full expected benefits. A failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the Combination could adversely affect the combined company’s results of operations.In addition, the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of client relationships and diversion of management’s attention. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others: the diversion of management attention to integration matters; difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from combining the businesses; difficulties in the integration of operations and systems; unanticipated costs, delays and other hardships to integration efforts, including any such costs, delays or hardships, caused by pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, including COVID-19 and the resulting travel and operations restrictions; difficulties in the assimilation of employees and culture; difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a larger and more complex company; challenges in retaining existing clients and obtaining new clients; and challenges in attracting and retaining key personnel.Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and attention, which could materially impact the business, financial condition and results of operations of the combined company. In addition, even if the operations of our and WTW’s businesses are integrated successfully, the full benefits of the Combination, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are expected, may not be realized within the anticipated time frame or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our and WTW’s businesses. All of these factors could decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the Combination and negatively impact the combined company’s results of operations.We have incurred and will incur substantial Combination fees and costs in connection with the Combination.We have incurred and expect to incur a number of non-recurring substantial Combination-related costs associated with the closing of the Combination, combining the operations of the two organizations and achieving desired synergies. These fees and costs will be substantial, and a portion of them will be incurred regardless of whether the Combination closes. Non-recurring Combination costs include, but are not limited to, fees paid to legal, financial and accounting advisors, retention, severance, change in control and other integration-related costs, filing fees and printing costs. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in connection with the closing and the integration of our and WTW’s businesses. There can be no assurance that the elimination of certain duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the two businesses, will offset the incremental Combination-related costs over time. Thus, any net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, the long term or at all, and these costs could adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operation prior to the closing and of the combined company following the closing.The global effective tax rate that will apply to the combined group subsequent to the Combination is uncertain and may vary from expectations.There can be no assurance that closing of the Combination pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, will allow the combined group to maintain any particular global effective corporate tax rate. No assurances can be given as to what the 25combined group’s global effective tax rate will be after the closing of the Combination because of, among other things, uncertainty regarding the jurisdictions in which the combined group will derive income and the amounts derived thereof, uncertainty regarding the ability and the time necessary to integrate business operations and entities, and uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which it will operate. As a result, the combined group’s actual global effective tax rate may vary from expectations following the Combination and that variance may be material. Litigation filed against WTW and/or Aon could prevent or delay the completion of the transaction or result in the payment of damages following completion of the transaction.WTW, Aon and members of the WTW Board may in the future be parties, among others, to various claims and litigation related to the Business Combination Agreement and the transaction. The results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict, and could delay or prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner, and could result in substantial costs to Aon and WTW, including, but not limited to, costs associated with the indemnification of their respective directors and officers. One of the conditions to the closing of the transaction is that no order (whether temporary or permanent) has been issued, promulgated, made, rendered or entered into by any court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction which restrains, enjoins, makes illegal or otherwise prohibits the consummation of the transaction (excluding certain laws and orders unrelated to the required antitrust clearances and the required regulatory clearances). Consequently, if plaintiffs are successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting WTW and Aon from completing the transaction on the terms contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, such an injunction may delay the completion of the transaction in the expected timeframe, or may prevent the transaction from being completed altogether.Risks Related to Being an Irish-incorporated CompanyWe are incorporated in Ireland, and Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the U.S. and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the U.S. against us in Ireland, based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the U.S. currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Ireland.As an Irish company, we are governed by the Irish Companies Act, which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of an Irish company generally are owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the U.S.In addition, depending on the circumstances, the acquisition, ownership and/or disposition of our ordinary shares may subject shareholders to different or additional tax consequences under Irish law including, but not limited to, Irish stamp duty, dividend withholding tax and capital acquisitions tax.As an Irish public limited company, certain capital structure decisions regarding the Company will require the approval of shareholders, which may limit the Company’s flexibility to manage its capital structure.Irish law generally provides that a board of directors may allot and issue shares (or rights to subscribe for or convert into shares) if authorized to do so by a company’s constitution or by an ordinary resolution of shareholders. Such authorization may be granted in respect of up to the entirety of a company’s authorized but unissued share capital and for a maximum period of five years, at which point it must be renewed by another ordinary resolution. The Company’s constitution authorizes our directors to allot shares up to the maximum of the Company’s authorized but unissued share capital for a period of five years from March 31, 2020. This authorization will need to be renewed by ordinary resolution upon its expiration and at periodic intervals thereafter. Under Irish law, an allotment authority may be given for up to five years at each renewal, but governance considerations may result in renewals for shorter periods or in respect of less than the maximum permitted number of shares being sought or approved.Irish law also generally provides shareholders with statutory pre-emption rights when new shares are issued for cash. However, it is possible for such statutory pre-emption rights to be dis-applied in a company’s constitution or by a special resolution of shareholders. Such dis-application of pre-emption rights may be given in respect of up to the entirety of a 26company’s authorized but unissued share capital and for a maximum period of five years, at which point it must be renewed by another special resolution. The Company’s constitution dis-applies statutory pre-emption rights up to the maximum of the Company’s authorized but unissued share capital for a period of five years from March 31, 2020. This dis-application will need to be renewed by special resolution upon its expiration and at periodic intervals thereafter. Under Irish law, a dis-application of statutory pre-emption rights may be given for up to five years at each renewal, but governance considerations may result in renewals for shorter periods or in respect of less than the maximum permitted number of unissued shares being sought or approved.Irish law requires us to have available “distributable profits” to pay dividends to shareholder and generally to make share repurchases and redemptionsUnder Irish law, we may only pay dividends and, generally, make share repurchases and redemptions from distributable profits. Distributable profits may be created through the earnings of the Company or other methods (including certain intra-group reorganizations involving the capitalization of the Company’s un-distributable profits and their subsequent reduction). While it is our intention to maintain a sufficient level of distributable profits in order to pay dividends on our ordinary shares and make share repurchases, there is no assurance that the Company will maintain the necessary level of distributable profits to do so"
16,AON,AON PLC,2020-02-14,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
The risk factors set forth below reflect risks associated with existing and potential business and the industries in which we operate generally and contain “forward-looking statements” as discussed in the “Business” Section of Part I, Item 1 of this report. Readers should consider these risks in addition to the other information contained in this report as our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected if any of these risks were to actually occur and the occurrence of such risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements in this document and elsewhere.In addition, you should consider the risks relating to the proposed Reorganization, which would result in an Irish public limited company serving as the new publicly traded parent company of Aon by means of a scheme of arrangement under English law. We cannot assure you that the Reorganization will be completed or, if it is, that we will realize the benefits we anticipate from the Reorganization. The risk factors relating to the Reorganization are described under “Risk Factors
” in our definitive proxy statement filed with the SEC on December 20, 2019, which section is incorporated herein by reference.Business RisksAn overall decline in economic and business activity could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of our business.7The results of our operations are generally affected by the level of business activity of our clients, which in turn is affected by the economy of the industries and markets these clients serve. Economic downturns, volatility, or uncertainty in the broader economy or in specific markets may cause reductions in technology and discretionary spending by our clients, which may result in reductions in the growth of new business or reductions in existing business. If our clients become financially less stable, enter bankruptcy, liquidate their operations or consolidate, our revenues and collectability of receivables could be adversely affected.The demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases, affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our Commercial Risk Solutions, Reinsurance Solutions, and Data and Analytic Service lines. The economic activity that impacts property and casualty insurance is most closely correlated with employment levels, corporate revenues, and asset values. Downward fluctuations in the year-over-year insurance premiums charged by insurers to protect against the same risk, referred to in the industry as softening of the insurance market, could adversely affect these businesses as a significant portion of the earnings are determined as a percentage of premiums charged to our clients. Insolvencies and consolidations associated with an economic downturn, especially insolvencies in the insurance industry, could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business. Also, error and omission claims against us, which we refer to as E&O claims, may increase in economic downturns, also adversely affecting our business.We face significant competitive pressures from traditional and non-traditional competitors that could affect our market share.As a global professional services firm, we compete with global, national, regional, and local insurance companies that market and service their own products, other financial services providers, brokers, and investment managers, independent firms, and consulting organizations affiliated with accounting, information systems, technology, and financial services firms. We compete with respect to service, product features, price, commission structure, technology, financial strength, ability to access certain insurance markets, and name recognition. Our competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources, larger customer bases, greater name recognition, more comprehensive products, stronger presence in certain geographies, or more established relationships with their customers and suppliers than we have. In addition, alliances among competitors or mergers of competitors could affect our market share, and some of our competitors may have or may develop a lower cost structure, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, or provide services that gain greater market acceptance than the services that we offer or develop. Competitors may be able to respond to the need for technological changes, innovate faster, respond better to evolving client demand and industry conditions, or price their services more aggressively than we do. They may also compete for skilled professionals, finance acquisitions, fund internal growth, and compete for market share more effectively than we do. Further, new and non-traditional competitors, clients’ increasing ability and determination to self-insure, and capital market alternatives to traditional insurance and reinsurance markets cause additional forms of competition and innovation that could affect our market share. This competition is further intensified by an industry trend where clients engage multiple brokers to service different portions of their accounts. If we fail to respond successfully to the to the evolving competition we face, our financial condition or results of operations might be adversely affected.If our clients are not satisfied with our services, we may face additional cost, loss of profit opportunities, damage to our reputation, or legal liability.We depend, to a large extent, on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for high-quality advice and solutions focused on risk, retirement, and health. If a client is not satisfied with our services, it could cause us to incur additional costs and impair profitability. Many of our clients are businesses that band together in industry groups or trade associations and actively share information among themselves about the quality of service they receive from their vendors. Accordingly, poor service to one client may negatively impact our relationships with multiple other clients. Moreover, if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, we could be subject to legal liability or loss of client relationships.The nature of much of our work involves assumptions and estimates concerning future events, the actual outcome of which we cannot know with certainty in advance. In our investment consulting business, we may be measured based on our track record regarding judgments and advice on investments that are susceptible to influences unknown at the time the advice was given. In addition, we could make computational, software programming, or data entry or management errors. A client may claim it suffered losses due to reliance on our consulting advice, which poses risks of liability exposure and costs of defense and increased insurance premiums. In addition, claims arising from our professional services may produce publicity that could hurt our reputation and business and adversely affect our ability to retain business or secure new business.Damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our reputation is a key asset of the Company. We advise our clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, financial condition, and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters or others could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential clients, which could make it 8difficult for us to attract new clients and retain existing ones. Negative public opinion could also result from actual or alleged conduct by us or those currently or formerly associated with us in any number of activities or circumstances, including third parties, the use and protection of data and systems, satisfaction of client expectations, and regulatory compliance. Damage to our reputation could affect the confidence of our clients, rating agencies, regulators, stockholders, and third parties in transactions that are important to our business adversely affecting our business, financial condition, and operating results.Revenues from commission arrangements may fluctuate due to many factors, including cyclical or permanent changes in the insurance and reinsurance markets outside of our control.Revenues from commission arrangements have historically been affected by significant fluctuations arising from uncertainties and changes in the industries in which we operate. A significant portion of our revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage. We have no control over premium rates, and our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction. The potential for changes in premium rates is significant, due to pricing cyclicality in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets.In addition to movements in premium rates, our ability to generate premium-based commission revenue may be challenged by:•the growing availability of alternative methods for clients to meet their risk-protection needs, including a greater willingness on the part of corporations to “self-insure,” the use of so-called “captive” insurers, and the development of capital markets-based solutions and other alternative capital sources for traditional insurance and reinsurance needs that increase market capacity, increase competition, and put pressure on pricing; •fluctuation in the need for insurance;•the level of compensation, as a percentage of premium, that insurance carriers are willing to compensate brokers for placement activity;•the growing desire of clients to move away from variable commission rates and instead compensate brokers based upon flat fees, which can negatively impact us as fees are not generally indexed for inflation and do not automatically increase with premium as does commission-based compensation; and•competition from insurers seeking to sell their products directly to consumers, including online sales, without the involvement of an insurance broker.The profitability of our consulting engagements with clients may not meet our expectations due to unexpected costs, cost overruns, early contract terminations, unrealized assumptions used in our contract bidding process or the inability to maintain our prices.Our profitability with respect to consulting engagements is highly dependent upon our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency. As we adapt to changes in our business and the market, adapt to the regulatory environment, enter into new engagements, acquire additional businesses, and take on new employees in new locations, we may not be able to manage our large, diverse and changing workforce, control our costs, or improve our efficiency.Our profit margin, and therefore our profitability, is largely a function of the rates we are able to charge for our services and the staffing costs for our personnel. Accordingly, if we are not able to maintain the rates we charge for our services or appropriately manage the staffing costs of our personnel, we may not be able to sustain our profit margin and our profitability will suffer. The prices we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors, including competitive factors, the extent of ongoing clients’ perception of our ability to add value through our services, and general economic conditions. If we cannot drive suitable cost efficiencies, our profit margins will suffer. Our cost efficiencies may also be impacted by factors such as our ability to transition consultants from completed projects to new assignments, our ability to secure new consulting engagements, our ability to forecast demand for consulting services (and, consequently, appropriately manage the size and location of our workforce), employee attrition, and the need to devote time and resources to training and professional and business development.In our investment consulting business, we advise or act on behalf of clients regarding their investments. The results of these investments are uncertain and subject to numerous factors, some of which are within our control and some which are not. Clients that experience losses or lower than expected investment returns may leave us for competitors and/or assert claims against us.Our investment consulting business provides advice to clients on: investment strategy, which can include advice on setting investment objectives, asset allocation, and hedging strategies; selection (or removal) of investment managers; the investment in different investment instruments and products; and the selection of other investment service providers such as custodians and transition managers. For some clients, we are responsible for making decisions on these matters and we may implement such decisions in a fiduciary or agency capacity without assuming title over the underlying funds or assets invested. Asset classes may experience poor absolute performance and third parties we recommend or select, such as investment managers, may underperform their benchmarks due to poor market performance, negligence, or other reasons, resulting in poor investment returns or losses. These losses may be attributable in whole or in part to failures on our part or to events entirely outside of our control, including but not limited to uncertainty in financial markets due to economic, political, and regulatory conditions. Regardless of the cause, 9clients, including client employees, participants or other third-party intended beneficiaries, who experience losses or allege that we overcharge for such fiduciary services have in the past asserted claims against us, and we anticipate future similar claims, which could be for significant amounts. Defending against these claims can involve potentially significant costs, including legal defense costs, as well as cause substantial distraction and diversion of other resources. Furthermore, our ability to limit our potential liability is restricted in certain jurisdictions and in connection with claims involving breaches of fiduciary or agency duties or other alleged errors or omissions. Additionally, clients experiencing losses or lower than expected investment returns may leave us for our competitors.Financial RisksWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows.We face exposure to adverse movements in exchange rates of currencies other than our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, as a significant portion of our business is located outside of the U.S. These exposures may change over time, and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. Approximately 54% of our consolidated revenue is non-U.S., attributed on the basis of where the services are performed, and the exposures created can have significant currency volatility. These currency exchange fluctuations create risk in both the translation of the financial results of our global subsidiaries into U.S. dollars for our consolidated financial statements, as well as in those of our operations that receive revenue and incur expenses other than in their respective local currencies, which can reduce the profitability of our operations based on the direction the respective currencies’ exchange rates move. A decrease in the value of certain currencies relative to other currencies could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that benefit to a greater degree from a specific exchange rate move and can, as a result, deliver services at a lower cost or receive greater revenues from such a transaction. Although we use various derivative financial instruments to help protect against adverse foreign exchange rate fluctuations, we cannot eliminate such risks, and, as a result, changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results. For example, the strengthening of the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies might adversely affect the value of our products and services when translated to U.S. dollar, even if the value of such products and services has not changed in their original currency.Changes in interest rates and deterioration of credit quality could reduce the value of our cash balances and investment portfolios and adversely affect our financial condition or results.Operating funds available for corporate use were $928 million at December 31, 2019 and are reported in Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments. Funds held on behalf of clients and insurers were $5.2 billion at December 31, 2019 and are reported in Fiduciary assets. We also carry an investment portfolio of other long-term investments. As of December 31, 2019, these long-term investments had a carrying value of $53 million. Adverse changes in interest rates, performance, and counterparty credit quality, including default, could reduce the value of these funds and investments, thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results. We may experience reduced investment earnings on our cash and short-term investments of fiduciary and operating funds if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain at or near their current low levels or fall below their current levels, or if negative yields on deposits or investments are experienced, as we have experienced in Japan and certain jurisdictions in the E.U. On the other hand, higher interest rates could result in a higher discount rate used by investors to value our future cash flows thereby resulting in a lower valuation of the Company. In addition, during times of stress in the banking industry, counterparty risk can quickly escalate, potentially resulting in substantial losses for us as a result of our cash or other investments with such counterparties, as well as substantial losses for our clients and the insurance companies with which we work.Our pension obligations and value of our pension assets could adversely affect our shareholders’ equity, net income, cash flow, and liquidity.To the extent that the pension obligations associated with our pension plans continue to exceed the fair value of the assets supporting those obligations, our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected. In particular, lower interest rates and investment returns could result in the present value of plan liabilities increasing at a greater rate than the value of plan assets, resulting in higher unfunded positions in our pension plans. In addition, the periodic revision of pension assumptions or variances of actual results from our assumptions can materially change the present value of expected future benefits, and therefore the funded status of the plans and resulting net periodic pension expense. As a result, we may experience future changes in the funded status of our plans that could require us to make additional cash contributions beyond those that have been estimated and which could adversely affect shareholders’ equity, net income, cash flow and liquidity.Our worldwide pension plans are significant, and therefore our pension contributions and expense are sensitive to various market, demographic, and other factors. These factors include equity and bond market returns, fair value of pension assets, the assumed interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities, foreign exchange rates, rates of inflation, mortality assumptions, potential regulatory and legal changes or developments, and counterparty exposure from various investments and derivative contracts, including annuities. Variations or developments in connection with any of these factors could cause significant changes 10to our financial position and results of operations from year to year. In addition, contributions are generally based on statutory requirements and local funding practices, which may differ from measurements under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”).We have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility.As of December 31, 2019, we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately $7.3 billion. The level of debt outstanding could adversely affect our financial flexibility by reducing our ability to use cash from operations for other purposes, including working capital, dividends to shareholders, share repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. We also are subject to risks that, at the time any of our outstanding debt matures, we will not be able to retire or refinance the debt on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.As of December 31, 2019, we had two committed credit facilities outstanding. Each of these facilities is intended to support our commercial paper obligations and our general working capital needs. In addition, each of these facilities included customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios of adjusted consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense and consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated EBITDA, tested quarterly.A substantial portion of our outstanding debt, including certain intercompany debt obligations, contains financial and other covenants. The terms of these covenants may limit our ability to obtain, or increase the costs of obtaining, additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or general corporate requirements. This in turn may have the impact of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, thereby placing us at a relative disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness, or fewer or less onerous covenants associated with such indebtedness, and making us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions.If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity, or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments, and alliances, any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business. Additionally, we may not be able to take such actions or refinance any of our debt, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.A decline in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper may adversely affect our borrowing costs, access to capital, and financial flexibility.A downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper could increase our borrowing costs, reduce or eliminate our access to capital, reduce our financial flexibility, and limit our ability to implement on corporate strategy. Our senior debt ratings at December 31, 2019 were A- with a stable outlook (Standard & Poor’s, or “S&P”), BBB+ with a stable outlook (Fitch, Inc., or “Fitch”), and Baa2 with a stable outlook (Moody’s Investor Services, or “Moody’s”). Our commercial paper ratings were A-2 (S&P), F-2 (Fitch) and P-2 (Moody’s).Real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect any trading market for, or trading value of, our securities. Such changes could result from any number of factors, including the modification by a credit rating agency of the criteria or methodology it applies to particular issuers, a change in the agency’s view of us or our industry, or as a consequence of actions we take to implement our corporate strategies. A change in our credit rating could adversely limit our access to capital and our competitive position.U.S. federal income tax reform could create uncertainty and adversely affect our business and financial condition.On December 22, 2017, U.S. federal tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”), was signed into law, significantly changing the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. These changes include, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate, subjecting certain future foreign subsidiary earnings, whether or not distributed, to U.S. tax under a Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income provision, imposing a new alternative “Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax” on U.S. corporations that limits deductions for certain deductible amounts payable to foreign affiliates, imposing significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest payable to related and unrelated lenders, and further limiting deductible executive compensation. The new provisions have been the subject of final regulations as well as proposed regulations and other guidance that, if and when issued in final form, could materially affect the application of the new statutory provisions. In many cases, the final and proposed regulations and other guidance will apply or are proposed to apply retroactively to the date of enactment of the Tax Reform Act. The government could also further modify the proposed rules when they are issued in final form. We continue to analyze how the Tax Reform Act, and any regulations or other governmental action with respect thereto, may impact our business and results of operations.  The changes effected pursuant to the Tax Reform Act, and the regulations or other governmental action thereunder, may have an adverse or volatile effect on our tax rate in fiscal years 2020 and beyond, thereby affecting our results of operations. Additionally, the resulting uncertainty with respect to the interpretation and application of the new provisions, and the risk that regulations or other governmental guidance, including revisions to any such regulations or other governmental action 11that may change the application of the new statutory provisions, may affect our assessment of the effect of the Tax Reform Act on our business and operations as we continue to analyze it.Our global effective tax rate is subject to a variety of different factors, which could create volatility in that tax rate, expose us to greater than anticipated tax liabilities or cause us to adjust previously recognized tax assets and liabilities.We are, and anticipate we will be, subject to income taxes in the U.K., U.S., Ireland and many other jurisdictions. As a result, our global effective tax rate from period to period can be affected by many factors, including changes in tax legislation or regulations, such as the enactment of the U.S. Tax Reform Act detailed above, the continuing development of regulations and other governmental action that affect the application of such legislation, our global mix of earnings, the use of global funding structures, the tax characteristics of our income, the effect of complying with transfer pricing requirements under laws of many different countries on our revenues and costs, the consequences of acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and business segments, and the portion of the income of non-U.S. subsidiaries that may be subject to U.S. tax, the portion of the income of non-U.K subsidiaries that may be subject to U.K. tax, or the portion of the income of non-Irish subsidiaries that may be subject to Irish tax whether or not distributed to the respective U.S., U.K. or Irish shareholders. In addition, we could be subject to increased taxation as a result of changes in eligibility for the benefits of current income tax treaties between and among the U.K., the U.S., Ireland and other countries, including any future amendments to the current income tax treaties between the U.K. and Ireland and other jurisdictions (including the U.S.), or any new statutory or regulatory provisions that might limit our ability to take advantage of any such treaties. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes, and our determination of the amount of our tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities. Our actual global tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material.We are, and anticipate we will be, subject to tax audits conducted by U.S., U.K., Ireland and other tax authorities, and the resolution of such audits could impact our tax rate in future periods, as would any reclassification or other changes (such as those in applicable accounting rules) that increases the amounts we have provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that we would be successful in attempting to mitigate the adverse impacts resulting from any changes in law, audits and other matters. Our inability to mitigate the negative consequences of any changes in the law, audits and other matters could cause our global tax rate to increase, our use of cash to increase and our financial condition and results of operations to suffer.Changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements. We are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, those relating to revenue recognition, pensions, recoverability of assets including customer receivables, valuation of goodwill and intangibles, contingencies, share-based payments, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances. These assumptions and estimates involve the exercise of judgment and discretion, which may evolve over time in light of operational experience, regulatory direction, developments or changes in accounting principles or standards, and other factors. Actual results could differ from these estimates, or changes in assumptions, estimates, policies, or developments in the business may change our initial estimates, which could materially affect the Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Financial Position, Shareholders’ Equity, and Cash Flows.We may be required to record goodwill or other long-lived asset impairment charges, which could result in a significant charge to earnings.Under U.S. GAAP, we review our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or other long-lived assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our share price or market capitalization, reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry. We may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or other long-lived assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and other long-lived assets. Future goodwill or other long-lived asset impairment charges could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.We are a holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends or other payments in needed amounts from our subsidiaries.The Company is organized as a holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating entities. As a holding company without significant operations of its own, our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our subsidiaries. We rely on dividends, interest, and other payments from these subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on 12outstanding debt, paying dividends to shareholders, repurchasing ordinary shares, and corporate expenses. Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate or other restrictions that may limit the amounts that subsidiaries can pay in dividends or other payments to us. No assurance can be given that there will not be further changes in law, regulatory actions, or other circumstances that could restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise make payments to us. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that our subsidiaries may be able to make timely payments to us in order for us to meet our obligations.Legal and Regulatory RisksWe are subject to E&O claims against us as well as other contingencies and legal proceedings, some of which, if determined unfavorably to us, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.We assist our clients with various matters, including advising on and placing insurance and reinsurance coverage and handling related claims, consulting on various human resources matters, and providing actuarial, investment consulting, and asset management services. E&O claims against us may allege our potential liability for damages arising from these services. E&O claims could include, for example, the failure of our employees or sub-agents, whether negligently or intentionally, to place coverage correctly or notify carriers of claims on behalf of clients, to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured, or the failure to give error-free consulting or investment advice. It is not always possible to prevent and detect E&O, and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases. In addition, we are subject to other types of claims, litigation, and proceedings in the ordinary course of business, which along with E&O claims, may seek damages, including punitive damages, in amounts that could, if awarded, have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, earnings, and cash flows. In addition to potential liability for monetary damages, such claims or outcomes could harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business.We have historically purchased, and intend to continue to purchase, insurance to cover E&O claims and other insurance to provide protection against certain losses that arise in such matters. However, we have exhausted or materially depleted our coverage under some of the policies that protect us for certain years and, consequently, are self-insured or materially self-insured for some historical claims. Additionally, parts or all of an E&O claim could fall within insurance deductibles, self-insured retentions, or policy exclusions. Accruals for these exposures, and related insurance receivables, when applicable, have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable. These accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as developments warrant and may also be adversely affected by disputes we may have with our insurers over coverage. Amounts related to settlement provisions are recorded in Other general expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Discussion of some of these claims, lawsuits, and proceedings are contained in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.In addition, we provide a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to our customers and others. In the event of a default, Aon’s potential exposure is equal to the amount of the guarantee or indemnification.The ultimate outcome of claims, lawsuits, proceedings, guarantees and indemnifications cannot be ascertained, and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us. It is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters.Our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which could reduce our profitability, limit our growth, or subject us to legal and regulatory actions.Our businesses are subject to extensive legal and regulatory oversight throughout the world, including the U.K. Companies Act and the rules and regulations promulgated by the FCA, the U.S. securities laws, rules, and regulations, and a variety of other laws, rules, and regulations addressing, among other things, licensing, data privacy and protection, trade sanctions laws, restrictions and export controls, anti-money laundering, wage-and-hour standards, employment and labor relations, anti-competition, anti-corruption, currency, reserves, government contracting, and the amount of local investment with respect to our operations in certain countries. This legal and regulatory oversight could reduce our profitability or limit our growth by: increasing the costs of legal and regulatory compliance; limiting or restricting the products or services we sell, the markets we serve or enter, the methods by which we sell our products and services, the prices we can charge for our services, or the form of compensation we can accept from our clients, carriers, and third parties; or by subjecting our businesses to the possibility of legal and regulatory actions, proceedings, or fines.The global nature of our operations increases the complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations adding to our cost of doing business. In addition, many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions, increasing the complexity and cost of compliance. In emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less developed legal systems, local laws and regulations may not be established with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us adequate assurance that we are operating our business in a compliant manner with all required licenses or that our rights are otherwise protected. In addition, certain laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance provisions of the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act in the U.S., and the Bribery Act of 2010 in the U.K., 13impact our operations outside of the legislating country by imposing requirements for the conduct of overseas operations, and in several cases, requiring compliance by foreign subsidiaries.In addition to the complexity of the laws and regulations themselves, the development of new laws and regulations or changes in application or interpretation of current laws and regulations also increases our legal and regulatory compliance complexity. Additionally, our acquisitions of new businesses and our continued operational changes and entry into new jurisdictions and new service offerings increases our legal and regulatory compliance complexity, as well as the type of governmental oversight to which we may be subject. Changes in laws and regulations could mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions, impose additional licensure requirements or costs to our operations and services, or cause us to cease offering certain services or solutions. Furthermore, as we enter new jurisdictions or businesses and further develop and expand our services, including through acquisitions, we may become subject to additional types of laws and governmental oversight and supervision, such as those applicable to the financial lending or other service institutions. Regulatory developments that could result in changes that adversely affect us or cause us to change our business or operations include: additional requirements respecting data privacy, data security, and data usage in jurisdictions in which we operate that may increase our costs of compliance and potentially reduce the manner in which we can use data; changes in tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate; regulatory actions or changes that require us to change our compensation model; or additional regulations promulgated by the FCA in the U.K., or other regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which we operate.In all jurisdictions, the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities. Generally, such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant, renew, and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations. Accordingly, we may have a license revoked or be unable to obtain new licenses and therefore be precluded or suspended from carrying on or developing some or all of our activities or otherwise fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction. No assurances can be given that our business can further develop or continue to be conducted in any given jurisdiction in the future as it has been conducted in the past.Changes in the regulatory scheme, or even changes in how existing regulations are interpreted, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations by limiting revenue streams or increasing costs of compliance. For instance, The General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in 2018, created a range of new compliance obligations, increased financial penalties for non-compliance, and extended the scope of the E.U. data protection law to all companies processing data of E.U. residents, wherever the company’s location. We have incurred substantial operational costs to bring our practices into compliance with GDPR and as other jurisdictions enact their own privacy and data protection regulations, we will incur further expenses to bring our practices in compliance with those regulations, which may differ from GDPR.Our business’ regulatory oversight also includes licensing of insurance brokers and agents, managing general agency or general underwriting operations, and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Our continuing ability to provide insurance broking in the jurisdictions in which we operate depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions. Also, we can be affected indirectly by the governmental regulation and supervision of insurance companies. For instance, if we are providing or managing general underwriting services for an insurer, we may have to contend with regulations affecting our client.Services provided in our Health Solutions and Retirement Solutions service lines are also the subject of ever-evolving government regulation, either because the services provided to our clients are regulated directly or because third parties upon whom we rely to provide services to clients are regulated, thereby indirectly affecting the manner in which we provide services to those clients. In particular, our health care exchange business depends upon the private sector of the U.S. insurance system and its role in financing health care delivery, and insurance carriers’ use and payment of commissions to agents, brokers, and other organizations to market and sell individual and family health insurance products and plans. Uncertainty regarding, or any changes to, state or federal law, or the interpretation of such law by applicable regulatory agencies could delay client adoption of our health care exchanges, impair our ability to retain clients who have adopted our health care exchanges, or cause insurance carriers to alter or eliminate the products and plans that they offer or attempt to move members into new products or plans for which we receive lower commissions. In addition, changes in laws, government regulations, or the way those regulations are interpreted in the jurisdictions in which we operate could affect the viability, value, use, or delivery of benefits and human resources programs, including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans (such as medical), defined contribution plans (such as 401(k)), or defined benefit plans (such as pension), may adversely affect the demand for, or profitability of, our services.If we violate the laws and regulations to which we are subject, we could be subject to fines, penalties, or criminal sanctions and could be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate these laws and regulations, causing an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.Heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny may lead to additional regulatory investigations, increased government involvement, or enforcement actions, which could consume significant management time and resources and could have adverse effects on our business and operations. For instance, increased scrutiny by competition authorities may increase our costs of doing 14business or force us to change the way we conduct business or refrain from or otherwise alter the way we engage in certain activities. Additionally, we operate in many different business lines, which may occasionally intersect with each other, such as placing both insurance and reinsurance or providing both investment consultancy and fiduciary management services.   If we fail to control possible resulting conflicts of interest, we could be subject to civil litigation, fines, penalties, and criminal sanctions and could be prohibited from participating in one or more lines of business.  As regulators and other government agencies continue to examine our operations, there is no assurance that consent orders or other enforcement actions will not be issued by them in the future. These and other initiatives from national, state, and local officials may subject us to judgments, settlements, fines, or penalties, or cause us to be required to restructure or divest operations and activities, all of which could lead to reputational issues, higher operational costs, business disruption or loss, thereby adversely affecting our business, financial condition, or operating results.Failure to protect our intellectual property rights, or allegations that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others, could harm our reputation, ability to compete effectively, and financial condition.To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on a combination of trademark laws, copyright laws, patent laws, trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements, and other contractual arrangements with our affiliates, employees, clients, strategic partners, and others, as well as internal policies and procedures regarding our management of intellectual property. However, the protective steps that we take may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Further, we operate in many foreign jurisdictions and effective trademark, copyright, patent, and trade secret protection may not be available in every country or jurisdiction in which we offer our services. Additionally, our competitors may develop products similar to our products that do not conflict with our related intellectual property rights. Failure to protect our intellectual property adequately could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively.In addition, to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, we may initiate litigation against third parties, such as infringement suits or interference proceedings.  Third parties may assert intellectual property rights claims against us, which may be costly to defend, could require the payment of damages, and could limit our ability to use or offer certain technologies, products, or other intellectual property. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be expensive, take significant time and divert management’s attention from other business concerns. Successful challenges against us could require us to modify or discontinue our use of technology or business processes where such use is found to infringe or violate the rights of others, or require us to purchase licenses from third parties, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.We have less flexibility as a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales with respect to certain aspects of capital management.English law imposes additional restrictions on certain corporate actions. For example, English law provides that a board of directors may only allot securities with the prior authorization of shareholders, with such authorization specifying a maximum amount of shares that may be allotted under it, and lasting for a maximum period of five years, each as specified in the articles of association or relevant shareholder resolution. The current authorization is effective until the earlier of our next annual general meeting or August 31, 2020. This authorization will need to be renewed by our shareholders periodically and we intend to renew this authorization at each annual general meeting held while we remain a U.K. company.English law also generally provides shareholders with preemptive rights when new shares are issued for cash; however, it is possible for the articles of association, or shareholders in general meeting, to exclude preemptive rights. Such an exclusion of preemptive rights may be for a maximum period of up to five years as specified in the articles of association or relevant shareholder resolution. The current exclusion is effective until the earlier of our next annual general meeting or August 31, 2020. This exclusion would need to be renewed by our shareholders periodically and we intend to renew this exclusion at each annual general meeting held while we remain a U.K. company.English law also requires us to have available “distributable reserves” to make share repurchases or pay dividends to shareholders. Distributable reserves may be created through the earnings of the U.K. parent company or other actions. As of December 31, 2019, we had distributable reserves in excess of $32.4 billion. While it is our intention to maintain a sufficient level of distributable reserves in order to pay dividends on our ordinary shares and make share repurchases, there is no assurance that the parent company level will maintain the necessary level of distributable reserves to do so.English law also generally prohibits a company from repurchasing its own shares by way of “off-market purchases” without the prior approval of our shareholders. Such approval lasts for a maximum period of up to five years. Our shares are traded on the NYSE, which is not a recognized investment exchange in the U.K. Consequently, any repurchase of our shares is currently considered an “off-market purchase.” The current authorization expires on June 22, 2023. Renewal of this authorization will be sought periodically.15The enforcement of civil liabilities against us may be more difficult.Because we are a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, investors could experience more difficulty enforcing judgments obtained against us in U.S. courts than would have been the case for a U.S. company. In addition, it may be more difficult (or impossible) to bring some types of claims against us in courts in England than it would be to bring similar claims against a U.S. company in a U.S. court.It may be difficult to enforce judgments against us obtained in the U.S. courts.We are a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Therefore, it may not be possible to effect service of process upon us within the U.S. in order to enforce judgments of U.S. courts against us based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws.There is doubt as to the enforceability in England and Wales, in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts, of civil liabilities solely based on the U.S. federal securities laws. The English courts will, however, treat any amount payable by us under U.S. judgment as a debt and new proceedings can be commenced in the English courts to enforce this debt against us. The following criteria must be satisfied in order for the English court to enforce the debt created by the U.S. judgment:•the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of laws principles and rules of English private international law at the time when proceedings were initiated; •the U.S. proceedings not having been brought in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause except with the agreement of the defendant or the defendant’s subsequent submission to the jurisdiction of the court; •the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money; •the recognition or enforcement, as the case may be, of the U.S. judgment not contravening English public policy in a sufficiently significant way or contravening the Human Rights Act 1998 (or any subordinate legislation made thereunder, to the extent applicable); •the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine, or otherwise based on a U.S. law that an English court considers to be a penal or revenue law; •the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained, and not otherwise being a judgment contrary to section 5 of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 or is a judgment based on measures designated by the Secretary of State under Section 1 of that Act; •the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural justice; •the U.S. judgment not being a judgment on a matter previously determined by an English court, or another court whose judgment is entitled to recognition (or enforcement as the case may be) in England, in proceedings involving the same parties which conflicts with an earlier judgment of such court; •the party seeking enforcement (being a party who is not ordinarily resident in some part of the U.K. or resident in an EU Member State) providing security for costs, if ordered to do so by the English courts; and •the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within the relevant limitation period.If an English court gives judgment for the sum payable under a U.S. judgment, the English judgment will be enforceable by methods generally available for this purpose. These methods generally permit the English court discretion to prescribe the manner of enforcement. Also note that, in any enforcement proceedings, the judgment debtor may raise any counterclaim that could have been brought if the action had been originally brought in England unless the subject of the counterclaim was in issue and denied in the U.S. proceedings.Operational RisksThe economic and political conditions of the countries and regions in which we operate, including the U.K.’s withdrawal from the E.U., could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity, and prospects for growth.Our operations in countries undergoing political change or experiencing economic instability are subject to uncertainty and risks that could materially adversely affect our business. These risks include, particularly in emerging markets, the possibility we would be subject to undeveloped or evolving legal systems, unstable governments and economies, and potential governmental actions affecting the flow of goods, services, and currency.Furthermore, the U.K.’s withdrawal from the E.U., which took place on January 31, 2020 (“Brexit”), has created uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. The U.K. entered an 11-month transition period until December 31, 2020, giving the U.K and the E.U. 11 months in which to negotiate and ratify the terms of what is often referred to as a “free trade deal”. With formal trade deal negotiations expected to begin in late February, there remains inevitable uncertainty about the scope 16of any such arrangement, particularly in key areas such as the regulation of financial services, tax, immigration and employment laws. Our publicly traded parent is incorporated in the U.K., and we have significant operations and a substantial workforce within the country. Aon enjoys certain benefits based on the U.K.’s membership in the E.U., and the lack of clarity around the future relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. creates uncertainty that may have a material impact on our business and operations. We may also be required to incur additional expense as we adapt to the new political and regulatory environment. We have taken steps and enacted plans, including the proposed Reorganization, to ensure that we are able to operate our business in the normal course following Brexit. However, if one or more of such actions or plans is unsuccessful or ineffective, or if we become non-compliant with any conditions attached to such plans or actions, it may affect our business operations and financial condition. Additionally, Brexit has the potential to adversely affect global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Additionally, any development that has the effect of devaluing the euro or British pound could meaningfully reduce the value of our assets and reduce the usefulness of liquidity alternatives denominated in that currency such as our multicurrency U.S. credit facility. We also deposit some of our cash, including cash held in a fiduciary capacity, with certain European financial institutions. While we continuously monitor and manage exposures associated with those deposits, to the extent the uncertainty surrounding economic stability in Europe and the future viability of the euro suddenly and adversely impacts those financial institutions, some or all of those cash deposits could be at risk.We may not realize all of the expected benefits from our restructuring plan and other operational improvement initiatives.In 2017, we initiated a global restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”) in connection with the sale of the Divested Business. The Restructuring Plan was intended to streamline operations across the organization and deliver greater efficiency, insight, and connectivity. The Restructuring Plan and was completed on December 31, 2019 and resulted in cumulative costs of approximately $1,433 million over the three-year period, consisting of approximately $619 million in workforce reduction, $119 million in technology rationalization costs, $69 million in lease consolidation costs, $53 million in non-cash asset impairments and $573 million in other costs, including certain separation costs associated with the sale of the Divested Business. We estimate that our annualized savings from the Restructuring Plan and other operational improvement initiatives will be approximately $580 million in 2020. Actual total savings and timing may differ from our estimates and we cannot assure that we will achieve the targeted savings. Unrealized savings in connection with the Restructuring Plan could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.Our success depends on our ability to retain and attract experienced and qualified personnel, including our senior management team and other professional personnel.We depend, in material part, upon the members of our senior management team who possess extensive knowledge and a deep understanding of our business and our strategy, as well as the colleagues who are critical to developing and retaining client relationships. The unexpected loss of services of any of these senior leaders could have a disruptive effect adversely impacting our ability to manage our business effectively and execute our business strategy. Competition for experienced professional personnel is intense, and we are constantly working to retain and attract these professionals. If we cannot successfully do so, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. While we have plans for key management succession and long-term compensation plans designed to retain our senior management team and critical colleagues, if our succession plans and retention programs do not operate effectively, our business could be adversely affected. We also are committed to diversity and inclusion and strive to maintain an equitable work environment that unlocks the full potential of all of our personnel.  If we are unsuccessful in maintaining such a work environment, we could experience difficulty attracting and retaining personnel, which could have a negative impact on our business.Our global operations expose us to various international risks that could adversely affect our business.Our operations are conducted globally. Accordingly, we are subject to regulatory, legal, economic, and market risks associated with operating in, and sourcing from, foreign countries, including:•difficulties in staffing and managing our foreign offices, including due to unexpected wage inflation or job turnover, and the increased travel, infrastructure, and legal and compliance costs and risks associated with multiple international locations;•hyperinflation in certain foreign countries;•conflicting regulations in the countries in which we do business;•imposition of investment requirements or other restrictions by foreign governments;•longer payment cycles;•greater difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;•insufficient demand for our services in foreign jurisdictions;•our ability to execute effective and efficient cross-border sourcing of services on behalf of our clients;17•the reliance on or use of third parties to perform services on behalf of the Company;•disparate tax regimes;•restrictions on the import and export of technologies; and•trade barriers.The occurrence of natural or man-made disasters could result in declines in business and increases in claims that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We are exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes, extreme weather, or other climate events; pandemic health events, and man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism, civil unrest, violence, military actions, and cyber-terrorism. The continued threat of terrorism and other events or disasters may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, and a natural or man-made disaster could trigger energy shortages, public health issues, or an economic downturn or instability in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster. These consequences could, among other things, result in a decline in business and increased claims from those areas. They could also result in reduced underwriting capacity, making it more difficult for our professionals to place business. Disasters also could disrupt public and private infrastructure, including communications and financial services, which could disrupt our normal business operations.A natural or man-made disaster also could disrupt the operations of our counterparties or result in increased prices for the products and services they provide to us. In addition, a disaster could adversely affect the value of the assets in our investment portfolio. Finally, a natural or man-made disaster could increase the incidence or severity of E&O claims against us.Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, or legal liability.Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our personnel, offices, and technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations. Should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as a security incident or attack, a natural disaster, climate event, terrorist attack, pandemic, power loss, telecommunications failure, or other natural or man-made disaster, our continued success will depend, in part, on the availability of our personnel and office facilities, and the proper functioning of computer systems, telecommunications, and other related systems and operations. In events like these, while our operational size, the multiple locations from which we operate, and our existing back-up systems provide us with some degree of flexibility, we still can experience near-term operational challenges in particular areas of our operations. We could potentially lose access to key executives, personnel, or client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario. A disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions, or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships, or legal liability.We rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business. Any significant system or network disruption due to a breach in the security of our information technology systems could have a negative impact on our reputation, operations, sales, and operating results.We rely on the efficient, uninterrupted, and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks, some of which are within the Company and some of which are outsourced to third parties. All information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including but not limited to cyber-attacks, computer viruses, security breaches, and unauthorized access or improper actions by insiders or employees. We are at risk of attack by a growing list of adversaries through new and increasingly sophisticated methods of attack. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, implement adequate preventative measures, or detect and respond quickly enough in the event of an incident or attack. We regularly experience attacks to our systems and networks and have from time to time experienced cybersecurity incidents, such as computer viruses, unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems, data loss via malicious and non-malicious methods, and similar incidents, which to date have not had a material impact on our business. If we are unable to efficiently and effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards, we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access. Problems with the information technology systems of vendors, including breakdowns or other disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, difficulties in the migration of services or data to third parties or the cloud hosted by third parties, cyber-attacks, and security breaches could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to customers and otherwise conduct business. Additionally, we are a global and acquisitive organization and we therefore might not adequately identify weaknesses in certain of our information systems, including those of targets we acquire, which could expose us to unexpected liabilities and fines or make our own systems more vulnerable to attack. These types of incidents affecting us or our third-party vendors could result in intellectual property or other confidential information being lost or stolen, including client or employee personal information or company data. 18We have implemented various measures to manage our risks related to system and network security and disruptions, but a security breach or a significant or extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems could damage our reputation, cause us to lose clients, adversely impact our operations, sales, and operating results, and require us to incur significant expense and divert resources to address and remediate or otherwise resolve such issues. Additionally, in order to maintain the level of security, service, and reliability that our clients require, we may be required to make significant additional investments in our information technology system.Improper disclosure of confidential, personal, or proprietary data could result in regulatory scrutiny, legal liability, or harm to our reputation.One of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our employees’ and clients’ confidential and proprietary information, including confidential information about our clients’ and employees’ compensation, medical information, and other personally identifiable information. We maintain policies, procedures, and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information. Nonetheless, we cannot eliminate the risk of human error, employee or vendor malfeasance, or cyber-attacks that could result in improper access to or disclosure of confidential, personal, or proprietary information. Such access or disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws and regulations that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs, fines, loss of revenue, and loss of clients. The release of confidential information as a result of a security breach could also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals or business partners, or by regulators, and the outcome of such proceedings, which could include penalties or fines, could have a significant negative impact on our business.In many jurisdictions, including in the E.U. and the U.S., we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the collection, use, retention, security, and transfer of this information. These laws and regulations are frequently changing and are becoming increasingly complex and sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services both in terms of substance and in terms of enforceability. This makes compliance challenging and expensive. Additionally, certain jurisdictions’ regulations include notice provisions that may require us to inform affected clients or employees in the event of a breach of confidential information before we fully understand or appreciate the extent of the breach. These notice provisions present operational challenges and related risk. In particular, the E.U.’s GDPR, which went into effect in May 2018, caused us to incur significant expenses in an effort to implement the applicable GDPR provisions within our business before the effective date causing distraction from other aspects of our business. In addition, non-compliance with GDPR could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others and additional costs in connection therewith. Other jurisdictions in which we operate have adopted their own regulations governing personal data and information, and we expect additional jurisdictions to continue to adopt regulations. We have and will continue to incur expenses and devote resources to bring our practices into compliance with these regulations and future regulations. Our failure to comply with or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability, result in proceedings or fines against us by governmental entities or others, or impair our reputation in the marketplace. Further, regulatory initiatives in the area of data protection are more frequently including provisions allowing authorities to impose substantial fines and penalties, and therefore, failure to comply could also have a significant financial impact.Our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to gain internal efficiencies through the application of technology or effectively apply technology in driving value for our clients through innovation and technology-based solutions. Conversely, investments in internal systems or innovative product offerings may fail to yield sufficient return to cover their investments.Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and implement technology-based solutions that anticipate or keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology, industry standards, and client preferences. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and cost-effective basis. The effort to gain technological expertise, develop new technologies in our business, and achieve internal efficiencies through technology require us to incur significant expenses and attract talent with the necessary skills. There is no assurance that our technological investments in internal systems will achieve the intended efficiencies and such unrealized savings or benefits could affect our results of operations. Additionally, if we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors, if our competitors develop more cost-effective technologies, or if our ideas are not accepted in the marketplace, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and complete client engagements. For example, we have invested significantly in the development of our proprietary databases, repositories of global insurance and reinsurance placement information, which we use to drive results for our clients in the insurance and reinsurance placement process. Our competitors are developing competing databases, and their success in this space may impact our ability to differentiate our services to our clients through the use of unique technological solutions. Innovations in software, cloud computing, or other technologies that alter how our services are delivered could significantly undermine our investment in this business if we are slow to innovate or unable to take advantage of these developments.We are continually developing and investing in innovative and novel service offerings that we believe will address needs that we identify in the markets. Nevertheless, for those efforts to produce meaningful value, we are reliant on a number of other factors, 19some of which our outside of our control. For example, our Health Solutions revenue line has invested substantial time and resources in launching health care exchanges under the belief that these exchanges will serve a useful role in helping corporations and individuals in the U.S. manage their growing health care expenses. In order for these exchanges to be successful, health care insurers and corporate and individual participants have to deem them suitable, and whether those parties will find them suitable will be subject to their own particular circumstances.We rely on third parties to perform key functions of our business operations enabling our provision of services to our clients. These third parties may act in ways that could harm our business.We rely on third parties, and in some cases subcontractors, to provide services, data, and information such as technology, information security, funds transfers, data processing, support functions, and administration that are critical to the operations of our business. These third parties include correspondents, agents and other brokerage and intermediaries, insurance markets, data providers, plan trustees, payroll service providers, benefits administrators, software and system vendors, health plan providers, investment managers, and providers of human resources, among others. As we do not fully control the actions of these third parties, we are subject to the risk that their decisions, actions, or inactions may adversely impact us and replacing these service providers could create significant delay and expense. A failure by third parties to comply with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements in a high quality and timely manner, particularly during periods of our peak demand for their services, could result in economic and reputational harm to us. In addition, we face risks as we transition from in-house functions to third-party support functions and providers that there may be disruptions in service or other unintended results that may adversely affect our business operations. These third parties face their own technology, operating, business, and economic risks, and any significant failures by them, including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client, employee, or company information, could cause harm to our business and reputation. An interruption in or the cessation of service by any service provider as a result of systems failures, cybersecurity incidents, capacity constraints, financial difficulties, or for any other reason could disrupt our operations, impact our ability to offer certain products and services, and result in contractual or regulatory penalties, liability claims from clients, or employees, damage to our reputation, and harm to our business.Our business is exposed to risks associated with the handling of client funds.Certain of our businesses collect premiums from insureds and remits the premiums to the respective insurers. We also collect claims or refunds from insurers on behalf of insureds, which are then remitted to the insureds. Consequently, at any given time, we may be holding and managing funds of our clients. This function creates a risk of loss arising from, among other things, fraud by employees or third parties, execution of unauthorized transactions, errors relating to transaction processing, or other cybersecurity events or security breaches. We are also potentially at risk in the event the financial institution in which we hold these funds suffers any kind of insolvency or liquidity event. The occurrence of any of these types of events in connection with this function could cause us financial loss and reputational harm.In connection with the implementation of our corporate strategies and initiatives, we face risks associated with, among others,  the acquisition or disposition of businesses, the integration and development of acquired businesses, and the entry into new lines of business or products,.In pursuing our corporate strategy, we often acquire other businesses or dispose of or exit businesses we currently own and we routinely are actively engaged in the process of identifying, analyzing, and negotiating possible transactions. The success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate acquisition and disposition targets, negotiate transactions on favorable terms, complete transactions and, in the case of acquisitions, successfully integrate them into our existing businesses and culture. If a proposed transaction is not consummated, the time and resources spent pursuing it could adversely result in missed opportunities to locate and acquire other businesses. If acquisitions are made, there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, including, but not limited to, revenue growth, operational efficiencies, or expected synergies, and we could incur unexpected costs in connection with integration. If we dispose of or otherwise exit certain businesses, there can be no assurance that we will not incur certain disposition related charges, we will be able to reduce overhead related to the divested assets, or will realized the intended benefits of the disposition.We may enter new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business either through acquisitions or through initiatives to generate organic revenue growth. These new lines of business, products, and services present the Company with additional risks, particularly in instances where the markets are new or not fully developed. Such risks include the investment of significant time and resources; the possibility that these efforts will be not be successful; the possibility that the marketplace does not accept our products or services or that we are unable to retain clients that adopt our new products or services; and the risk of new or additional liabilities associated with these efforts. In addition, many of the businesses that we acquire and develop will likely have significantly smaller scales of operations prior to the implementation of our growth strategy. If we are not able to manage the growing complexity of these businesses, including improving, refining, or revising our systems and operational practices, and enlarging the scale and scope of the businesses, our business may be adversely affected. Other risks include developing knowledge of and experience in the new business, product or service, integrating the acquired business into 20our systems and culture, recruiting and retaining experienced professionals, and developing and capitalizing on new relationships with experienced market participants. External factors, such as compliance with new or revised regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business, products, or services. Failure to manage these risks in the acquisition or development of new businesses could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in connection with the sale of the Divested Business.On May 1, 2017, we sold the Divested Business to an entity controlled by affiliates of The Blackstone Group L.P. (the “Buyer”). This transaction carries inherent risks, including the risk that we will not earn the $500 million of additional consideration or otherwise realize the intended value of the transaction. Furthermore, we have entered into ongoing commercial arrangements with the Buyer.  If we do not realize the intended benefits of these arrangements, it could affect our results of operations or adversely affect our relationship with clients, partners, colleagues, and other third parties. Additionally, if the Divested Business does not deliver the level of service to which our clients and partners are accustomed, it could adversely affect our relationships with such third parties.Risks Related to Our Ordinary SharesTransfers of the Class A Ordinary Shares may be subject to stamp duty or SDRT in the U.K., which would increase the cost of dealing in the Class A Ordinary Shares.Stamp duty reserve taxes (“SDRT”) are imposed in the U.K. on certain transfers of chargeable securities (which include shares in companies incorporated in the U.K.) at a rate of 0.5 percent of the consideration paid for the transfer. Certain transfers of shares to depositories or into clearance systems are charged at a higher rate of 1.5 percent.Our Class A Ordinary Shares are eligible to be held in book entry form through the facilities of Depository Trust Company (“DTC”). Transfers of shares held in book entry form through DTC will not attract a charge to stamp duty or SDRT in the U.K. A transfer of the shares from within the DTC system out of DTC and any subsequent transfers that occur entirely outside the DTC system will attract a charge to stamp duty at a rate of 0.5 percent of any consideration, which is payable by the transferee of the shares. Any such duty must be paid (and the relevant transfer document stamped by Her Majesty’s Revenues and Customs (“HMRC”)) before the transfer can be registered in the share registers of Aon. If those shares are redeposited into DTC, the redeposit will attract stamp duty or SDRT at a rate of 1.5 percent of the value of the shares.We have put in place arrangements to require that shares held in certificated form cannot be transferred into the DTC system until the transferor of the shares has first delivered the shares to a depository specified by us so that SDRT may be collected in connection with the initial delivery to the depository. Any such shares will be evidenced by a receipt issued by the depository. Before the transfer can be registered in our share registers, the transferor will also be required to put in the depository funds to settle the resultant liability to SDRT, which will be charged at a rate of 1.5 percent of the value of the shares"
9,AON,AON PLC,2019-02-19,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
The risk factors set forth below reflect material risks associated with existing and potential business and contain “forward-looking statements” as discussed in the “Business” Section of Part I, Item 1 of this report. Readers should consider them in addition to the other information contained in this report as our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected if any of these risks were to actually occur.The following are material risks related to our businesses specifically and the industries in which we operate generally that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements in this document and elsewhere.Business RisksAn overall decline in economic activity could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of our business.The results of our operations are generally affected by the level of business activity of our clients, which in turn is affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets these clients serve. Economic downturns, volatility, or uncertainty in some markets may cause reductions in technology and discretionary spending by our clients, which may result in reductions in the growth of new business or reductions in existing business. If our clients become financially less stable, enter bankruptcy, liquidate their operations or consolidate, our revenues and collectability of receivables could be adversely affected.The demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases, affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our Commercial Risk Solutions, Reinsurance Solutions, and Data and Analytic Services revenue lines. The economic activity that impacts property and casualty insurance is most closely correlated with employment levels, corporate revenue, and asset values. Downward fluctuations in the year-over-year insurance premiums charged by insurers to protect against the same risk, referred to in the industry as softening of the insurance market, could adversely affect these businesses as a significant portion of the earnings are determined as a percentage of premium charged to our clients. Insolvencies and consolidations associated with an economic downturn, especially insolvencies in the insurance industry, could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business. Also, error and omission claims against us, which we refer to as E&O claims, may increase in economic downturns, also adversely affecting our business.We face significant competitive pressures.As a global professional services firm, we compete with global, national, regional, and local insurance companies that market and service their own products, other financial services providers, brokers, and investment managers, independent firms, and consulting organizations affiliated with accounting, information systems, technology, and financial services firms. We compete with respect to service, product features, price, commission structure, financial strength, ability to access certain insurance markets, and name recognition. Our competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources, larger customer bases, greater name recognition, more comprehensive products, stronger presence in certain geographies, or more established relationships with their 7customers and suppliers than we have. In addition, new competitors, alliances among competitors, or mergers of competitors could emerge and gain significant market share, and some of our competitors may have or may develop a lower cost structure, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, or provide services that gain greater market acceptance than the services that we offer or develop. Competitors may be able to respond to the need for technological changes and innovate faster, or price their services more aggressively. They may also compete for skilled professionals, finance acquisitions, fund internal growth, and compete for market share more effectively than we do. This competition is intensified by an industry trend where clients engage multiple brokers to service different portions of their accounts. If we fail to respond successfully to the competition we face, our financial condition or results of operations might be adversely affected. If our clients or third parties are not satisfied with our services, we may face additional cost, loss of profit opportunities, damage to our reputation, or legal liability.We depend, to a large extent, on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for high-quality advice and solutions focused on risk, retirement, and health. If a client is not satisfied with our services, it could cause us to incur additional costs and impair profitability. Many of our clients are businesses that band together in industry groups or trade associations and actively share information among themselves about the quality of service they receive from their vendors. Accordingly, poor service to one client may negatively impact our relationships with multiple other clients. Moreover, if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, we could be subject to legal liability or loss of client relationships.The nature of much of our work involves assumptions and estimates concerning future events, the actual outcome of which we cannot know with certainty in advance. In our investment consulting business, we may be measured based on our track record regarding judgments and advice on investments that are susceptible to influences unknown at the time the advice was given. In addition, we could make computational, software programming, or data entry or management errors. A client may claim it suffered losses due to reliance on our consulting advice, which poses risks of liability exposure and costs of defense and increased insurance premiums. In addition, claims arising from our professional services may produce publicity that could hurt our reputation and business and adversely affect our ability to retain business or secure new business.Damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our reputation is a key asset of the Company. We advise our clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, financial condition, and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters or others could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential clients, which could make it difficult for us to attract new clients and retain existing ones. Negative public opinion could also result from actual or alleged conduct by us or those currently or formerly associated with us in any number of activities or circumstances, including third parties, the use and protection of data and systems, satisfaction of client expectations, and regulatory compliance. Damage to our reputation could affect the confidence of our clients, rating agencies, regulators, stockholders, and third parties in transactions that are important to our business adversely effecting our business, financial condition, and operating results.Revenues from commission arrangements may fluctuate due to many factors, including cyclical or permanent changes in the insurance and reinsurance markets outside of our control.Revenues from commission arrangements have historically been affected by significant fluctuations arising from uncertainties and changes in the industries in which we operate. A significant portion of our revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage. We have no control over premium rates, and our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction. The potential for changes in premium rates is significant, due to pricing cyclicality in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets.In addition to movements in premium rates, our ability to generate premium-based commission revenue may be challenged by:•the growing availability of alternative methods for clients to meet their risk-protection needs, including a greater willingness on the part of corporations to “self-insure,” the use of so-called “captive” insurers, and the development of capital markets-based solutions and other alternative capital sources for traditional insurance and reinsurance needs that increase market capacity, increase competition, and put pressure on pricing; •fluctuation in the need for insurance;•the level of compensation, as a percentage of premium, that insurance carriers are willing to compensate brokers for placement activity;•the growing desire of clients to move away from variable commission rates and instead compensate brokers based upon flat fees, which can negatively impact us as fees are not generally indexed for inflation and do not automatically increase with premium as does commission-based compensation; and8•competition from insurers seeking to sell their products directly to consumers, including online sales, without the involvement of an insurance broker.The profitability of our consulting engagements with clients may not meet our expectations due to unexpected costs, cost overruns, early contract terminations, unrealized assumptions used in our contract bidding process or the inability to maintain our prices. Our profitability with respect to consulting engagements is highly dependent upon our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency. As we adapt to changes in our business, adapt to the regulatory environment, enter into new engagements, acquire additional businesses, and take on new employees in new locations, we may not be able to manage our large, diverse and changing workforce, control our costs, or improve our efficiency.Our profit margin, and therefore our profitability, is largely a function of the rates we are able to charge for our services and the staffing costs for our personnel. Accordingly, if we are not able to maintain the rates we charge for our services or appropriately manage the staffing costs of our personnel, we may not be able to sustain our profit margin and our profitability will suffer. The prices we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors, including competitive factors, the extent of ongoing clients’ perception of our ability to add value through our services, and general economic conditions. If we cannot drive suitable cost efficiencies, our profit margins will suffer. Our cost efficiencies may also be impacted by factors such as our ability to transition consultants from completed projects to new assignments, our ability to secure new consulting engagements, our ability to forecast demand for consulting services (and, consequently, appropriately manage the size and location of our workforce), employee attrition, and the need to devote time and resources to training and professional and business development.In our investment consulting business, we advise or act on behalf of clients regarding their investments. The results of these investments are uncertain and subject to numerous factors, some of which are within our control and some which are not. Clients that experience losses or lower than expected investment returns may leave us for competitors and/or assert claims against us.Our investment consulting business provides advice to clients on: investment strategy, which can include advice on setting investment objectives, asset allocation, and hedging strategies; selection (or removal) of investment managers; the investment in different investment instruments and products; and the selection of other investment service providers such as custodians and transition managers. For some clients, we are responsible for making decisions on these matters and we may implement such decisions in a fiduciary or agency capacity without assuming title or custody over the underlying funds or assets invested. Asset classes may experience poor absolute performance and third parties we recommend or select, such as investment managers, may underperform their benchmarks due to poor market performance, negligence, or other reasons, resulting in poor investment returns or losses. These losses may be attributable in whole or in part to failures on our part or to events entirely outside of our control, including but not limited to uncertainty in financial markets due to economic, political, and regulatory conditions. Regardless of the cause, clients experiencing losses or clients that allege that we overcharge for such fiduciary services have in the past asserted claims against us, and we anticipate future similar claims, which could be for significant amounts. Defending against these claims can involve potentially significant costs, including legal defense costs, as well as cause substantial distraction and diversion of other resources. Furthermore, our ability to limit our potential liability is restricted in certain jurisdictions and in connection with claims involving breaches of fiduciary or agency duties or other alleged errors or omissions. Additionally, clients experiencing losses or lower than expected investment returns may leave us for our competitors.Financial RisksWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows.We face exposure to adverse movements in exchange rates of currencies other than our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, as a significant portion of our business is located outside of the U.S. These exposures may change over time, and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. Approximately 57% of our consolidated revenue is non-U.S., attributed on the basis of where the services are performed, and the exposures created can have significant currency volatility. These currency exchange fluctuations create risk in both the translation of the financial results of our global subsidiaries into U.S. dollars for our consolidated financial statements, as well as in those of our operations that receive revenue and incur expenses other than in their respective local currencies, which can reduce the profitability of our operations based on the direction the respective currencies’ exchange rates move. A decrease in the value of certain currencies relative to other currencies could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that benefit to a greater degree from a specific exchange rate move and can, as a result, deliver services at a lower cost or receive greater revenues from such a transaction. Although we use various derivative financial instruments to help protect against adverse foreign exchange rate fluctuations, we cannot eliminate such risks, and, as a result, changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results. For example, the strengthening of the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies might adversely affect the value of our products and services when translated to U.S. dollar, even if the value of such products and services has not changed in their original currency.Changes in interest rates and deterioration of credit quality could reduce the value of our cash balances and investment portfolios and adversely affect our financial condition or results.9Operating funds available for corporate use were $828 million at December 31, 2018 and are reported in Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments. Funds held on behalf of clients and insurers were $3.9 billion at December 31, 2018 and are reported in Fiduciary assets. We also carry an investment portfolio of other long-term investments. As of December 31, 2018, these long-term investments had a carrying value of $54 million. Adverse changes in interest rates, performance, and counterparty credit quality, including default, could reduce the value of these funds and investments, thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results. We may experience reduced investment earnings on our cash and short-term investments of fiduciary and operating funds if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain at or near their current low levels, or if negative yields on deposits or investments are experienced, as we have experienced in Japan and certain jurisdictions in the European Union. On the other hand, higher interest rates could result in a higher discount rate used by investors to value our future cash flows thereby resulting in a lower valuation of the Company. In addition, during times of stress in the banking industry, counterparty risk can quickly escalate, potentially resulting in substantial losses for us as a result of our cash or other investments with such counterparties, as well as substantial losses for our clients and the insurance companies with which we work.Our pension obligations and value of our pension assets could adversely affect our shareholders’ equity, net income, cash flow and liquidity.To the extent that the pension obligations associated with our pension plans continue to exceed the fair value of the assets supporting those obligations, our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected. In particular, lower interest rates and investment returns could result in the present value of plan liabilities increasing at a greater rate than the value of plan assets, resulting in higher unfunded positions in our pension plans. In addition, the periodic revision of pension assumptions or variances of actual results from our assumptions can materially change the present value of expected future benefits, and therefore the funded status of the plans and resulting net periodic pension expense. As a result, we may experience future changes in the funded status of our plans that could require us to make additional cash contributions beyond those that have been estimated and which could adversely affect shareholders’ equity, net income, cash flow and liquidity.Our worldwide pension plans are significant, and therefore our pension contributions and expense are sensitive to various market, demographic, and other factors. These factors include equity and bond market returns, fair value of pension assets, the assumed interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities, foreign exchange rates, rates of inflation, mortality assumptions, potential regulatory and legal changes or developments and counterparty exposure from various investments and derivative contracts, including annuities. Variations or developments in connection with any of these factors could cause significant changes to our financial position and results of operations from year to year. In addition, contributions are generally based on statutory requirements and local funding practices, which may differ from measurements under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”).We have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility.As of December 31, 2018, we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately $6.2 billion. The level of debt outstanding could adversely affect our financial flexibility by reducing our ability to use cash from operations for other purposes, including working capital, dividends to shareholders, share repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. We also are subject to risks that, at the time any of our outstanding debt matures, we will not be able to retire or refinance the debt on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.As of December 31, 2018, we had two committed credit facilities outstanding. Each of these facilities is intended to support our commercial paper obligations and our general working capital needs. In addition, each of these facilities included customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios of adjusted consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense and consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated EBITDA, tested quarterly.  A substantial portion of our outstanding debt, including certain intercompany debt obligations, contains financial and other covenants. The terms of these covenants may limit our ability to obtain, or increase the costs of obtaining, additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or general corporate requirements. This in turn may have the impact of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, thereby placing us at a relative disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness, or fewer or less onerous covenants associated with such indebtedness, and making us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions.If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity, or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments, and alliances, any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business. Additionally, we may not be able to effect such actions or refinance any of our debt, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.10A decline in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper may adversely affect our borrowing costs, access to capital, and financial flexibility.A downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper could increase our borrowing costs, reduce or eliminate our access to capital, reduce our financial flexibility, and limit our ability to implement on corporate strategy. Our senior debt ratings at December 31, 2018 were A- with a stable outlook (Standard & Poor’s, or “S&P”), BBB+ with a stable outlook (Fitch, Inc., or “Fitch”), and Baa2 with a stable outlook (Moody’s Investor Services, or “Moody’s”). Our commercial paper ratings were A-2 (S&P), F-2 (Fitch) and P-2 (Moody’s).Real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect any trading market for, or trading value of, our securities. Such changes could result from any number of factors, including the modification by a credit rating agency of the criteria or methodology it applies to particular issuers, a change in the agency’s view of us or our industry, or as a consequence of actions we take to implement our corporate strategies. A change in our credit rating could adversely limit our access to capital and our competitive position.U.S. federal income tax reform could create uncertainty and adversely affect our business and financial condition.On December 22, 2017, U.S. federal tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”), was signed into law, significantly changing the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. These changes include, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate, subjecting certain future foreign subsidiary earnings, whether or not distributed, to U.S. tax under a Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income provision, imposing a new alternative “Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax” on U.S. corporations that limits deductions for certain deductible amounts payable to foreign affiliates, imposing significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest payable to related and unrelated lenders, further limiting deductible executive compensation, and imposing a one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries accumulations through the end of 2017. The new provisions have been the subject of proposed regulations and other guidance that, if and when issued in final form, could materially affect the application of the new statutory provisions. In many cases, the proposed regulations and other guidance proposed to apply retroactively to the date of enactment of the Tax Reform Act. The government could also further modify the rules when they are issued in final form. We continue to analyze how the Tax Reform Act, and any regulations or other governmental action with respect thereto, may impact our business and results of operations.  The changes effected pursuant to the Tax Reform Act, and the regulations or other governmental action thereunder, may have an adverse or volatile effect on our tax rate in fiscal years 2019 and beyond, thereby affecting our results of operations. Additionally, the resulting uncertainty with respect to the interpretation and application of the new provisions, and the risk that regulations or other governmental guidance, including revisions to any such regulations or other governmental action that may change the application of the new statutory provisions, may affect our assessment of the effect of the Tax Reform Act on our business and operations as we continue to analyze it.Our global effective tax rate is subject to a variety of different factors, which could create volatility in that tax rate, expose us to greater than anticipated tax liabilities or cause us to adjust previously recognized tax assets and liabilities.We are subject to income taxes in the U.K., U.S. and many other jurisdictions. As a result, our global effective tax rate from period to period can be affected by many factors, including changes in tax legislation or regulations, such as the enactment of the U.S. Tax Reform Act detailed above, the continuing development of regulations and other governmental action that affect the application of such legislation, our global mix of earnings, the use of global funding structures, the tax characteristics of our income, the effect of complying with transfer pricing requirements under laws of many different countries on our revenues and costs, the consequences of acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and business segments, and the portion of the income of non-U.S. subsidiaries that may be subject to U.S. tax, or the portion of the income of non-U.K subsidiaries that may be subject to U.K. tax, whether or not distributed to the respective U.S. or U.K. shareholders. In addition, we could be subject to increased taxation as a result of changes in eligibility for the benefits of current income tax treaties between and among the U.K., the U.S., and other countries, including any future amendments to the current income tax treaties between the U.K. and other jurisdictions (including the U.S.), or any new statutory or regulatory provisions that might limit our ability to take advantage of any such treaties. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes, and our determination of the amount of our tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities. Our actual global tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material.We are subject to tax audits conducted by U.S., U.K., and other tax authorities, and the resolution of such audits could impact our tax rate in future periods, as would any reclassification or other changes (such as those in applicable accounting rules) that increases the amounts we have provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that we would be successful in attempting to mitigate the adverse impacts resulting from any changes in law, audits and other matters. Our inability to mitigate the negative consequences of any changes in the law, audits and other matters could cause our global tax rate to increase, our use of cash to increase and our financial condition and results of operations to suffer.11Changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. We are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, those relating to revenue recognition, restructuring, pensions, recoverability of assets including customer receivables, valuation of goodwill and intangibles, contingencies, share-based payments, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances. These assumptions and estimates involve the exercise of judgment and discretion, which may evolve over time in light of operational experience, regulatory direction, developments or changes in accounting principles or standards, and other factors. Actual results could differ from these estimates, or changes in assumptions, estimates, policies, or developments in the business may change our initial estimates, which could materially affect the Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Financial Position, Shareholders’ Equity, and Cash Flows.We may be required to record goodwill or other long-lived asset impairment charges, which could result in a significant charge to earnings.Under U.S. GAAP, we review our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or other long-lived assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our share price or market capitalization, reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry. We may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or other long-lived assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and other long-lied intangible assets. Future goodwill or other long-lived asset impairment charges could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.We are a holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends or other payments in needed amounts from our subsidiaries.The Company is organized as a holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating entities. As a holding company without significant operations of its own, our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our subsidiaries. We rely on dividends, interest, and other payments from these subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt, paying dividends to shareholders, repurchasing ordinary shares, and corporate expenses. Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate or other restrictions that may limit the amounts that subsidiaries can pay in dividends or other payments to us. No assurance can be given that there will not be further changes in law, regulatory actions, or other circumstances that could restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise make payments to us. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that our subsidiaries may be able to make timely payments to us in order for us to meet our obligations.Legal and Regulatory RisksWe are subject to E&O claims against us as well as other contingencies and legal proceedings, some of which, if determined unfavorably to us, could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of a business line or the Company as a whole.We assist our clients with various matters, including placing insurance and reinsurance coverage and handling related claims, consulting on various human resources matters, and providing actuarial, investment consulting, and asset management services. E&O claims against us may allege our potential liability for damages arising from these services. E&O claims could include, for example, the failure of our employees or sub-agents, whether negligently or intentionally, to place coverage correctly or notify carriers of claims on behalf of clients, to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured, or the failure to give error-free consulting or investment advice. It is not always possible to prevent and detect E&O, and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases. In addition, we are subject to other types of claims, litigation, and proceedings in the ordinary course of business, which along with E&O claims, may seek damages, including punitive damages, in amounts that could, if awarded, have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, earnings, and cash flows. In addition to potential liability for monetary damages, such claims or outcomes could harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business.We have historically purchased, and intend to continue to purchase, insurance to cover E&O claims and other insurance to provide protection against certain losses that arise in such matters. However, we have exhausted or materially depleted our coverage under some of the policies that protect us for certain years and, consequently, are self-insured or materially self-insured for some historical claims. Additionally, parts or all of an E&O claim could fall within insurance deductibles, self-insured retentions, or policy exclusions. Accruals for these exposures, and related insurance receivables, when applicable, have been provided to the 12extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable. These accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as developments warrant and may also be adversely affected by disputes we may have with our insurers over coverage. Amounts related to settlement provisions are recorded in Other general expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Discussion of some of these claims, lawsuits, and proceedings are contained in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.In addition, we provide a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to our customers and others. In the event of a default, Aon’s potential exposure is equal to the amount of the guarantee or indemnification. The ultimate outcome of  claims, lawsuits, proceedings, guarantees and indemnifications cannot be ascertained, and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us. It is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters.Our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which could reduce our profitability, limit our growth, or increase competition.Our businesses are subject to extensive legal and regulatory oversight throughout the world, including the U.K. Companies Act and the rules and regulations promulgated by the FCA, the U.S. securities laws, rules, and regulations, and a variety of other laws, rules, and regulations addressing, among other things, licensing, data privacy and protection, trade restriction and export controls, anti-money laundering, wage-and-hour standards, employment and labor relations, anti-competition, anti-corruption, currency, reserves, government contracting, and the amount of local investment with respect to our operations in certain countries. This legal and regulatory oversight could reduce our profitability or limit our growth by: increasing the costs of legal and regulatory compliance; limiting or restricting the products or services we sell, the markets we serve or enter, the methods by which we sell our products and services, the prices we can charge for our services, or the form of compensation we can accept from our clients, carriers, and third parties; or by subjecting our businesses to the possibility of legal and regulatory actions, proceedings, or fines.The global nature of our operations increases the complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations adding to our cost of doing business. In addition, many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions, increasing the complexity and cost of compliance. In emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less developed legal systems, local laws and regulations may not be established with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us adequate assurance that we are operating our business in a compliant manner with all required licenses or that our rights are otherwise protected. In addition, certain laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance provisions of the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act (“FATCA”) in the U.S., and the Bribery Act of 2010 (“U.K. Bribery Act”) in the U.K., impact our operations outside of the legislating country by imposing requirements for the conduct of overseas operations, and in several cases, requiring compliance by foreign subsidiaries.In addition to the complexity of the laws and regulations themselves, the development of new laws and regulations or changes in application or interpretation of current laws and regulations also increases our legal and regulatory compliance complexity. Additionally, our acquisitions of new businesses and our continued operational changes and entry into new jurisdictions and new service offerings increases our legal and regulatory compliance complexity, as well as the type of governmental oversight to which we may be subject. Changes in laws and regulations could mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions, could impose additional licensure requirements or costs to our operations and services, or even cause us to cease offering certain services or solutions. Furthermore, as we enter new jurisdictions or businesses and further develop and expand our services, we may become subject to additional types of laws and policies and governmental oversight and supervision, such as those applicable to the financial lending or other service institutions. New regulatory developments that could result in changes that adversely affect us or cause us to change our business or operations include: additional requirements respecting data privacy, data security, and data usage in jurisdictions in which we operate that may increase our costs of compliance and potentially reduce the manner in which we can use data; additional changes in tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate; changes in accounting standards; regulatory actions or changes that require us to change our compensation model; or additional regulations promulgated by the FCA in the U.K., or other regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which we operate.In all jurisdictions, the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities. Generally, such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant, renew, and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations. Accordingly, we may have a license revoked or be unable to obtain new licenses and therefore be precluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on or developing some or all of our activities or otherwise fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction. No assurances can be given that our business can further develop or continue to be conducted in any given jurisdiction in the future as it has been conducted in the past.Changes in the regulatory scheme, or even changes in how existing regulations are interpreted, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations by limiting revenue streams or increasing costs of compliance. For instance, The General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018, created a range of new compliance obligations, increased financial penalties for non-compliance, and extended the scope of the European Union data protection law to all companies processing data 13of European Union residents, wherever the company’s location. We have incurred substantial operational costs to bring our practices into compliance with GDPR and where other jurisdictions enact privacy and data protection regulations, we will incur further expenses to bring our practices in compliance with those regulations, which may differ from GDPR.Our business’ regulatory oversight also includes licensing of insurance brokers and agents, managing general agency or general underwriting operations, and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Our continuing ability to provide insurance broking in the jurisdictions in which we operate depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions. Also, we can be affected indirectly by the governmental regulation and supervision of insurance companies. For instance, if we are providing or managing general underwriting services for an insurer, we may have to contend with regulations affecting our client.Services provided in our Health Solutions and Retirement Solutions revenue lines are also the subject of ever-evolving government regulation, either because the services provided to our clients are regulated directly or because third parties upon whom we rely to provide services to clients are regulated, thereby indirectly affecting the manner in which we provide services to those clients. In particular, our health care exchange business depends upon the private sector of the U.S. insurance system and its role in financing health care delivery, and insurance carriers’ use and payment of commissions to agents, brokers, and other organizations to market and sell individual and family health insurance products and plans. Uncertainty regarding, or any changes to, state or federal law, or the interpretation of such law by applicable regulatory agencies, including the effects of health care reform by the U.S. government, could delay client adoption of our health care exchanges, impair our ability to retain clients who have adopted our health care exchanges, or cause insurance carriers to alter or eliminate the products and plans that they offer or attempt to move members into new products or plans for which we receive lower commissions. In addition, changes in laws, government regulations, or the way those regulations are interpreted in the jurisdictions in which we operate could affect the viability, value, use, or delivery of benefits and human resources programs, including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans (such as medical), defined contribution plans (such as 401(k)), or defined benefit plans (such as pension), may adversely affect the demand for, or profitability of, our services.If we violate the laws and regulations to which we are subject, we could be subject to fines, penalties, or criminal sanctions and could be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate these laws and regulations, causing an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.Heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny may lead to additional regulatory investigations, increased government involvement, or enforcement actions. For instance, increased scrutiny by competition authorities may increase our costs of doing business or force us to change the way we conduct business or refrain from or otherwise alter the way we engage in certain activities. Additionally, we operate in many different business lines, which may occasionally intersect with each other, such as placing both insurance and reinsurance or providing both investment consultancy and fiduciary management services.   If we fail to control possible resulting conflicts of interest, we could be subject to civil litigation, fines, penalties, and criminal sanctions and could be prohibited from participating in one or more lines of business.  As regulators and other government agencies continue to examine our operations, there is no assurance that consent orders or other enforcement actions will not be issued by them in the future. These and other initiatives from national, state, and local officials may subject us to judgments, settlements, fines, or penalties, or cause us to be required to restructure or divest operations and activities, all of which could lead to reputational issues, higher operational costs, business disruption or loss, thereby adversely affecting our business, financial condition, or operating results.Failure to protect our intellectual property rights, or allegations that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others, could harm our reputation, ability to compete effectively, and financial condition.To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on a combination of trademark laws, copyright laws, patent laws, trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements, and other contractual arrangements with our affiliates, employees, clients, strategic partners, and others. However, the protective steps that we take may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Further, effective trademark, copyright, patent, and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer our services or competitors may develop products similar to our products that do not conflict with our related intellectual property rights. Failure to protect our intellectual property adequately could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively.In addition, to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, we may initiate litigation against third parties, such as infringement suits or interference proceedings.  Third parties may assert intellectual property rights claims against us, which may be costly to defend, could require the payment of damages, and could limit our ability to use or offer certain technologies, products, or other intellectual property. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be expensive, take significant time and divert management’s attention from other business concerns. Successful challenges against us could require us to modify or discontinue our use of technology or business processes where such use is found to infringe or violate the rights of others, or 14require us to purchase licenses from third parties, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.We have less flexibility as a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales with respect to certain aspects of capital management.English law imposes additional restrictions on certain corporate actions. For example, English law provides that a board of directors may only allot securities with the prior authorization of shareholders, with such authorization specifying a maximum amount of shares that may be allotted under it, and lasting for a maximum period of five years, each as specified in the articles of association or relevant shareholder resolution. The current authorization is effective until the earlier of our next annual general meeting or August 31, 2019. This authorization will need to be renewed by our shareholders periodically and we intend to renew this authorization at each annual general meeting.English law also generally provides shareholders with preemptive rights when new shares are issued for cash; however, it is possible for the articles of association, or shareholders in general meeting, to exclude preemptive rights. Such an exclusion of preemptive rights may be for a maximum period of up to five years as specified in the articles of association or relevant shareholder resolution. The current exclusion is effective until the earlier of our next annual general meeting or August 31, 2019. This exclusion would need to be renewed by our shareholders periodically and we intend to renew this exclusion at each annual general meeting.English law also requires us to have available “distributable reserves” to make share repurchases or pay dividends to shareholders.  Distributable reserves may be created through the earnings of the U.K. parent company or other actions.  As of December 31, 2018, we had distributable reserves in excess of $2.2 billion. While it is our intention to maintain a sufficient level of distributable reserves in order to pay dividends on our ordinary shares and make share repurchases, there is no assurance that the parent company level will maintain the necessary level of distributable reserves to do so. If at any time we do not have sufficient distributable reserves to declare and pay dividends, we may undertake a reduction in capital of the Company to reduce the amount of our share capital and non-distributable reserves and to create a corresponding increase in our distributable reserves out of which future distributions to shareholders could be made.English law also generally prohibits a company from repurchasing its own shares by way of “off-market purchases” without the prior approval of our shareholders. Such approval lasts for a maximum period of up to five years. Our shares are traded on the NYSE, which is not a recognized investment exchange in the U.K. Consequently, any repurchase of our shares is currently considered an “off market purchase.”  The current authorization expires on June 22, 2023. Renewal of this authorization will be sought periodically.The enforcement of civil liabilities against us may be more difficult.Because we are a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, investors could experience more difficulty enforcing judgments obtained against us in U.S. courts than would have been the case for a U.S. company. In addition, it may be more difficult (or impossible) to bring some types of claims against us in courts in England than it would be to bring similar claims against a U.S. company in a U.S. court.We are a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Therefore, it may not be possible to effect service of process upon us within the U.S. in order to enforce judgments of U.S. courts against us based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws.There is doubt as to the enforceability in England and Wales, in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts, of civil liabilities solely based on the U.S. federal securities laws. The English courts will, however, treat any amount payable by us under U.S. judgment as a debt and new proceedings can be commenced in the English courts to enforce this debt against us. The following criteria must be satisfied in order for the English court to enforce the debt created by the U.S. judgment:•the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of laws principles and rules of English private international law at the time when proceedings were initiated; •the U.S. proceedings not having been brought in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause except with the agreement of the defendant or the defendant’s subsequent submission to the jurisdiction of the court; •the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money; •the recognition or enforcement, as the case may be, of the U.S. judgment not contravening English public policy in a sufficiently significant way or contravening the Human Rights Act 1998 (or any subordinate legislation made thereunder, to the extent applicable); •the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine, or otherwise based on a U.S. law that an English court considers to be a penal or revenue law; 15•the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained, and not otherwise being a judgment contrary to section 5 of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 or is a judgment based on measures designated by the Secretary of State under Section 1 of that Act; •the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural justice; •the U.S. judgment not being a judgment on a matter previously determined by an English court, or another court whose judgment is entitled to recognition (or enforcement as the case may be) in England, in proceedings involving the same parties which conflicts with an earlier judgment of such court; •the party seeking enforcement (being a party who is not ordinarily resident in some part of the U.K. or resident in an EU Member State) providing security for costs, if ordered to do so by the English courts; and •the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within the relevant limitation period.If an English court gives judgment for the sum payable under a U.S. judgment, the English judgment will be enforceable by methods generally available for this purpose. These methods generally permit the English court discretion to prescribe the manner of enforcement. Also note that, in any enforcement proceedings, the judgment debtor may raise any counterclaim that could have been brought if the action had been originally brought in England unless the subject of the counterclaim was in issue and denied in the U.S. proceedings.Operational RisksThe economic and political conditions of the countries and regions in which we operate, including the U.K.’s expected withdrawal from the European Union, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity, and prospects for growth.Our operations in countries undergoing political change or experiencing economic instability are subject to uncertainty and risks that could materially adversely affect our business. These risks include, particularly in emerging markets, the possibility we would be subject to undeveloped or evolving legal systems, unstable governments and economies, and potential governmental actions affecting the flow of goods, services, and currency.Furthermore, the U.K.’s withdrawal from the European Union, which is legally scheduled for March 29, 2019 (“Brexit”), has created uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.K. and the European Union. As the U.K. and European Union continue to negotiate the terms of the U.K.’s withdrawal, given the rejection of the proposed deal by the U.K. Parliament on January 15, there remains inevitable uncertainty on topics such as financial laws and regulations, tax and free trade agreements, immigration laws, and employment laws. Our publicly traded parent is incorporated in the U.K. and we have significant operations and a substantial workforce therein and therefore enjoy certain benefits based on the U.K.’s membership in the European Union. The lack of clarity about Brexit and, whether, in the future U.K. laws and regulations are recognized in the EU, creates uncertainty for us as the eventual outcome of negotiations may affect our business and operations. We may be required to incur additional expense as we adapt to the political and regulatory environment post-Brexit. This may include legal entity structure changes, adjusting the way we engage with some of our European and U.K. clients, or choosing to re-locate some of our staff. We are currently examining the various impacts to our business and operating models in an effort to develop solutions to address any of the potential outcomes of the negotiations, so our organization can continue to provide our clients with the services and expertise they require. We also cannot be certain that regulators in other European Union countries will grant us the permissions or licenses we seek to operate our business. We have and will continue to invest significant time and resources as we navigate the effects of Brexit, and the uncertainty related thereto, on our business and operations. A less orderly Brexit has the potential to adversely affect global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Additionally, any development that has the effect of devaluing the euro or British pound could meaningfully reduce the value of our assets and reducing the usefulness of liquidity alternatives denominated in that currency such as our multicurrency U.S. credit facility. We also deposit some of our cash, including cash held in a fiduciary capacity, with certain European financial institutions. While we continuously monitor and manage exposures associated with those deposits, to the extent the uncertainty surrounding economic stability in Europe and the future viability of the euro suddenly and adversely impacts those financial institutions, some or all of those cash deposits could be at risk.We may not realize all of the expected benefits from our restructuring plan and other operational improvement initiatives.In 2017, we initiated a global restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”) in connection with the sale of the Divested Business. The Restructuring Plan is intended to streamline operations across the organization and deliver greater efficiency, insight and connectivity. We expect these restructuring activities and related expenses to affect continuing operations through the forth quarter of 2019, including an estimated 4,800 to 5,400 role eliminations. The Restructuring Plan is expected to result in cumulative costs of approximately $1,225 million through the end of the Restructuring Plan, consisting of approximately $450 million in 16employee termination costs, $130 million in IT rationalization costs, $65 million in real estate realization costs, $50 million in asset impairment costs and $530 million in other costs associated with the restructuring. Included in the estimated $1,225 million is $100 million of estimated non-cash charges. We estimate that our annualized savings from the Restructuring Plan and other operational improvement initiatives will be approximately $500 million by the end of 2019. Actual total costs, savings, and timing may vary from these estimates due to changes in the scope or assumptions underlying the Restructuring Plan and other operational improvement initiatives.  We therefore cannot assure that we will achieve the targeted savings. Unanticipated costs or unrealized savings in connection with the Restructuring Plan and other operational improvement initiatives could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.Our success depends on our ability to retain and attract experienced and qualified personnel, including our senior management team and other professional personnel.We depend, in material part, upon the members of our senior management team who possess extensive knowledge and a deep understanding of our business and our strategy, as well as the colleagues who are critical to developing and retaining client relationships. The unexpected loss of services of any of these senior leaders could have a disruptive effect adversely impacting our ability to manage our business effectively and execute our business strategy. Competition for experienced professional personnel is intense, and we are constantly working to retain and attract these professionals. If we cannot successfully do so, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. While we have plans for key management succession and long-term compensation plans designed to retain our senior management team and critical colleagues, if our succession plans and retention programs do not operate effectively, our business could be adversely affected. We also are committed to diversity and inclusion and strive to maintain an equitable work environment that unlocks the full potential of all of our personnel.  If we are unsuccessful in maintaining such a work environment, we could experience difficulty attracting and retaining personnel, which could have a negative impact on our business.Our global operations expose us to various international risks that could adversely affect our business.Our operations are conducted globally. Accordingly, we are subject to regulatory, legal, economic, and market risks associated with operating in, and sourcing from, foreign countries, including:•difficulties in staffing and managing our foreign offices, including due to unexpected wage inflation or job turnover, and the increased travel, infrastructure, and legal and compliance costs and risks associated with multiple international locations;•hyperinflation in certain foreign countries;•conflicting regulations in the countries in which we do business;•imposition of investment requirements or other restrictions by foreign governments;•longer payment cycles;•greater difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;•insufficient demand for our services in foreign jurisdictions;•our ability to execute effective and efficient cross-border sourcing of services on behalf of our clients;•the reliance on or use of third parties to perform services on behalf of the Company;•disparate tax regimes;•restrictions on the import and export of technologies; and•trade barriers.The occurrence of natural or man-made disasters could result in declines in business and increases in claims that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We are exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes, extreme weather, or other climate events; pandemic health events, and man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism, civil unrest, violence, military actions, and cyber-terrorism. The continued threat of terrorism and other events or disasters may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, and a natural or man-made disaster could trigger energy shortages, public health issues, or an economic downturn or instability in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster. These consequences could, among other things, result in a decline in business and increased claims from those areas. They could also result in reduced underwriting capacity, making it more difficult for our professionals to place business. Disasters also could disrupt public and private infrastructure, including communications and financial services, which could disrupt our normal business operations.A natural or man-made disaster also could disrupt the operations of our counterparties or result in increased prices for the products and services they provide to us. In addition, a disaster could adversely affect the value of the assets in our investment portfolio. Finally, a natural or man-made disaster could increase the incidence or severity of E&O claims against us.17Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, or legal liability.Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our personnel, offices, and technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations. Should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as a security incident or attack, a natural disaster, climate event, terrorist attack, pandemic, power loss, telecommunications failure, or other natural or man-made disaster, our continued success will depend, in part, on the availability of our personnel and office facilities, and the proper functioning of computer systems, telecommunications, and other related systems and operations. In events like these, while our operational size, the multiple locations from which we operate, and our existing back-up systems provide us with some degree of flexibility, we still can experience near-term operational challenges in particular areas of our operations. We could potentially lose access to key executives, personnel, or client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario. A disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions, or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships, or legal liability.We rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business. Any significant system or network disruption due to a breach in the security of our information technology systems could have a negative impact on our reputation, operations, sales, and operating results.We rely on the efficient, uninterrupted, and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks, some of which are within the Company and some of which are outsourced to third parties. All information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including but not limited to cyber-attacks, computer viruses, security breaches, and unauthorized access or improper actions by insiders or employees. We are at risk of attack by a growing list of adversaries through increasingly sophisticated methods of attack. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, implement adequate preventative measures, or respond quickly enough in the event of an incident or attack. We regularly experience attacks to our systems and networks and have from time to time experienced cybersecurity incidents, such as computer viruses, unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems, data loss via malicious and non-malicious methods, and similar incidents, which to date have not had a material impact on our business. If we are unable to efficiently and effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards, we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access. Problems with the information technology systems of vendors, including breakdowns or other disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, cyber-attacks, and security breaches at a vendor could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to customers and otherwise conduct  business. Additionally, we are a global and acquisitive organization and we therefore might not adequately identify weaknesses in certain of our information systems, including those of targets we acquire, which could expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems more vulnerable to attack. These types of incidents affecting us or our third-party vendors could result in intellectual property or other confidential information being lost or stolen, including client or employee personal information, or company data. In addition, we may not be able to detect breaches in our information technology systems or assess the severity or impact of a breach in a timely manner.We have implemented various measures to manage our risks related to system and network security and disruptions, but a security breach or a significant or extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems could damage our reputation, cause us to lose clients, adversely impact our operations, sales and operating results, and require us to incur significant expense and divert resources to address and remediate or otherwise resolve such issues. Additionally, in order to maintain the level of security, service, and reliability that our clients require, we may be required to make significant additional investments in our information technology system.18Improper disclosure of confidential, personal, or proprietary data could result in regulatory scrutiny, legal liability, or harm to our reputation.One of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our employees’ and clients’ confidential and proprietary information, including confidential information about our clients’ and employees’ compensation, medical information, and other personally identifiable information. We maintain policies, procedures, and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information. Nonetheless, we cannot eliminate the risk of human error, employee or vendor malfeasance, or cyber-attacks that could result in improper access to or disclosure of confidential, personal, or proprietary information. Such access or disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws and regulations that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs, loss of revenue, and loss of clients. The release of confidential information as a result of a security breach could also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals or business partners, or by regulators, and the outcome of such proceedings, which could include penalties or fines, could have a significant negative impact on our business.In many jurisdictions, including in the European Union and the U.S., we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the collection, use, retention, security, and transfer of this information. These laws and regulations are frequently changing and are becoming increasingly complex and sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services both in terms of substance and in terms of enforceability. This makes compliance challenging and expensive. Additionally, certain jurisdictions’ regulations include notice provisions that may require us to inform affected clients or employees in the event of a breach of confidential information before we fully understand or appreciate the extent of the breach. These notice provisions present operational challenges and related risk. In particular, the European Union’s GDPR, which went into effect in May 2018, caused us to incur significant expenses in an effort to implement the applicable GDPR provisions within our business before the effective date causing distraction from other aspects of our business. In addition, non-compliance with GDPR could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others and additional costs in connection therewith. We expect other jurisdictions in which we operate to adopt regulations governing personal data and information, and we will have to continue to incur expenses and devote resources to bring our practices into compliance with such future regulations. Our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impair our reputation in the marketplace. Further, regulatory initiatives in the area of data protection are more frequently including provisions allowing authorities to impose substantial fines and penalties, and therefore, failure to comply could also have a significant financial impact.Our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to effectively apply technology in driving value for our clients through technology-based solutions or gain internal efficiencies through the effective application of technology and related tools. Conversely, investments in innovative product offerings may fail to yield sufficient return to cover their investments.Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and implement technology solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology, industry standards, and client preferences. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and cost-effective basis, and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace. Additionally, the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses. If we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors or if our competitors develop more cost-effective technologies, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and complete client engagements. For example, we have invested significantly in the development of our proprietary databases, repositories of global insurance and reinsurance placement information, which we use to drive results for our clients in the insurance and reinsurance placement process. Our competitors are developing competing databases, and their success in this space may impact our ability to differentiate our services to our clients through the use of unique technological solutions. Innovations in software, cloud computing, or other technologies that alter how our services are delivered could significantly undermine our investment in this business if we are slow or unable to take advantage of these developments.We are continually developing and investing in innovative and novel service offerings that we believe will address needs that we identify in the markets. Nevertheless, for those efforts to produce meaningful value, we are reliant on a number of other factors, some of which our outside of our control. For example, our Health Solutions revenue line has invested substantial time and resources in launching health care exchanges under the belief that these exchanges will serve a useful role in helping corporations and individuals in the U.S. manage their growing health care expenses. In order for these exchanges to be successful, health care insurers and corporate and individual participants have to deem them suitable, and whether those parties will find them suitable will be subject to their own particular circumstances.19We rely on third parties to perform key functions of our business operations enabling our provision of services to our clients. These third parties may act in ways that could harm our business.We rely on third parties, and in some cases subcontractors, to provide services, data, and information such as technology, information security, funds transfers, data processing, and administration and support functions that are critical to the operations of our business. These third parties include correspondents, agents and other brokerage and intermediaries, insurance markets, data providers, plan trustees, payroll service providers, benefits administrators, software and system vendors, health plan providers, investment managers, and providers of human resource, among others. As we do not fully control the actions of these third parties, we are subject to the risk that their decisions, actions, or inactions may adversely impact us and replacing these service providers could create significant delay and expense. A failure by third parties to comply with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements in a high quality and timely manner, particularly during periods of our peak demand for their services, could result in economic and reputational harm to us. In addition, we face risks as we transition from in-house functions to third-party support functions and providers that there may be disruptions in service or other unintended results that may adversely affect our business operations. These third parties face their own technology, operating, business, and economic risks, and any significant failures by them, including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client, employee, or company information, could cause harm to our reputation. An interruption in or the cessation of service by any service provider as a result of systems failures, cybersecurity incidents, capacity constraints, financial difficulties, or for any other reason could disrupt our operations, impact our ability to offer certain products and services, and result in contractual or regulatory penalties, liability claims from clients, or employees, damage to our reputation, and harm to our business.Our business is exposed to risks associated with the handling of client funds.Certain of our businesses collect premiums from insureds and remits the premiums to the respective insurers. We also collect claims or refunds from insurers on behalf of insureds, which are then remitted to the insureds. Consequently, at any given time, we may be holding and managing funds of our clients. This function creates a risk of loss arising from, among other things, fraud by employees or third parties, execution of unauthorized transactions, errors relating to transaction processing, or other cybersecurity events or security breaches. We are also potentially at risk in the event the financial institution in which we hold these funds suffers any kind of insolvency or liquidity event. The occurrence of any of these types of events in connection with this function could cause us financial loss and reputational harm.In connection with the implementation of our corporate strategies, we face risks associated with the acquisition or disposition of businesses, the entry into new lines of business, the integration of acquired businesses, and the growth and development of these businesses.In pursuing our corporate strategy, we often acquire other businesses or dispose of or exit businesses we currently own. The success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate acquisition and disposition targets, negotiate transactions on favorable terms, complete transactions and, in the case of acquisitions, successfully integrate them into our existing businesses. If a proposed transaction is not consummated, the time and resources spent pursuing it could adversely result in missed opportunities to locate and acquire other businesses. If acquisitions are made, there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, including, but not limited to, revenue growth, operational efficiencies, or expected synergies. If we dispose of or otherwise exit certain businesses, there can be no assurance that we will not incur certain disposition related charges, or that we will be able to reduce overhead related to the divested assets.From time to time, either through acquisitions or internal development, we enter new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. These new lines of business or new products and services present the Company with additional risks, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. Such risks include the investment of significant time and resources; the possibility that these efforts will be not be successful; the possibility that the marketplace does not accept our products or services or that we are unable to retain clients that adopt our new products or services; and the risk of additional liabilities associated with these efforts. In addition, many of the businesses that we acquire and develop will likely have significantly smaller scales of operations prior to the implementation of our growth strategy. If we are not able to manage the growing complexity of these businesses, including improving, refining, or revising our systems and operational practices, and enlarging the scale and scope of the businesses, our business may be adversely affected. Other risks include developing knowledge of and experience in the new business, integrating the acquired business into our systems and culture, recruiting professionals, and developing and capitalizing on new relationships with experienced market participants. External factors, such as compliance with new or revised regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business. Failure to manage these risks in the acquisition or development of new businesses could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.20We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in connection with the sale of the Divested Business.On May 1, 2017, we sold the Divested Business to an entity controlled by affiliates of The Blackstone Group L.P. (the “Buyer”). This transaction carries inherent risks, including the risk that we will not earn the $500 million of additional consideration or otherwise realize the intended value of the transaction, as well as risks connected with separating the Divested Business from Aon. We are party to a transition services agreement with the Buyer and there are risks associated with this transition services agreement, particularly as we transition off of the Buyer’s systems and services and initiate our own new systems and processes, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.Furthermore, we have entered into ongoing commercial arrangements with the Buyer.  If we do not realize the intended benefits of these arrangements, it could affect our results of operations or adversely affect our relationship with clients, partners, colleagues, and other third parties.  Additionally, if the Divested Business does not deliver the level of service to which our clients and partners are accustomed, it could adversely affect our relationships with such third parties.Our results may be adversely affected by changes in the mode of compensation in the insurance industry.In the past, the Attorney General of the State of New York brought charges against members of the insurance brokerage community. These actions have created uncertainty concerning longstanding methods of compensating insurance brokers. Given that the insurance brokerage industry has faced scrutiny from regulators in the past over its compensation practices, and the transparency and discourse to clients regarding brokers’ compensation, it is possible that regulators may choose to revisit the same or other practices in the future. If they do so, compliance with new regulations along with any sanctions that might be imposed for past practices deemed improper could have an adverse impact on our future results of operations and inflict significant reputational harm on our business.Risks Related to Our Ordinary SharesTransfers of the Class A Ordinary Shares may be subject to stamp duty or SDRT in the U.K., which would increase the cost of dealing in the Class A Ordinary Shares.Stamp duty reserve taxes (“SDRT”) are imposed in the U.K. on certain transfers of chargeable securities (which include shares in companies incorporated in the U.K.) at a rate of 0.5 percent of the consideration paid for the transfer. Certain transfers of shares to depositories or into clearance systems are charged at a higher rate of 1.5 percent.Our Class A Ordinary Shares are eligible to be held in book entry form through the facilities of Depository Trust Company (“DTC”). Transfers of shares held in book entry form through DTC will not attract a charge to stamp duty or SDRT in the U.K. A transfer of the shares from within the DTC system out of DTC and any subsequent transfers that occur entirely outside the DTC system will attract a charge to stamp duty at a rate of 0.5 percent of any consideration, which is payable by the transferee of the shares. Any such duty must be paid (and the relevant transfer document stamped by Her Majesty’s Revenues and Customs (“HMRC”)) before the transfer can be registered in the share registers of Aon. If those shares are redeposited into DTC, the redeposit will attract stamp duty or SDRT at a rate of 1.5 percent of the value of the shares.We have put in place arrangements to require that shares held in certificated form cannot be transferred into the DTC system until the transferor of the shares has first delivered the shares to a depository specified by us so that SDRT may be collected in connection with the initial delivery to the depository. Any such shares will be evidenced by a receipt issued by the depository. Before the transfer can be registered in our share registers, the transferor will also be required to put in the depository funds to settle the resultant liability to SDRT, which will be charged at a rate of 1.5 percent of the value of the shares.If the Class A Ordinary Shares are not eligible for continued deposit and clearing within the facilities of DTC, then transactions in our securities may be disrupted.The facilities of DTC are a widely used mechanism that allow for rapid electronic transfers of securities between the participants in the DTC system, which include many large banks and brokerage firms. We believe that prior to our reincorporation in the U.K. in 2012 (the “Redomestication”), approximately 99% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Aon Corporation were held within the DTC system. The Class A Ordinary Shares of Aon plc are, at present, eligible for deposit and clearing within the DTC system. In connection with the closing of the Redomestication, we entered into arrangements with DTC whereby we agreed to indemnify DTC for any stamp duty and/or SDRT that may be assessed upon it as a result of its service as a depository and clearing agency for our Class A Ordinary Shares. In addition, we have obtained a ruling from HMRC in respect of the stamp duty and SDRT consequences of the reorganization, and SDRT has been paid in accordance with the terms of this ruling in respect of the deposit of Class A Ordinary Shares with the initial depository. DTC will generally have discretion to cease to act as a depository and clearing agency for the Class A Ordinary Shares. If DTC determines at any time that the Class A Ordinary Shares are not eligible for continued deposit and clearance within its facilities, then we believe the Class A Ordinary Shares would not be eligible for continued listing on a U.S. securities exchange or inclusion in the S&P 500 and trading in the Class A Ordinary Shares would 21be disrupted. While we would pursue alternative arrangements to preserve our listing and maintain trading, any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of the Class A Ordinary Shares"
18,AON,AON PLC,2018-02-20,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
The risk factors set forth below reflect material risks associated with existing and potential business and contain “forward-looking statements” as discussed in the “Business” Section of Part I, Item 1 of this report. Readers should consider them in addition to the other information contained in this report as our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected if any of these risks were to actually occur.The following are material risks related to our businesses specifically and the industries in which we operate generally that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements in this document and elsewhere.Business RisksAn overall decline in economic activity could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of our business.The results of our operations are generally affected by the level of business activity of our clients, which in turn is affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets these clients serve. Economic downturns, volatility, or uncertainty in some markets may cause reductions in technology and discretionary spending by our clients, which may result in reductions in the growth of new business or reductions in existing business. If our clients become financially less stable, enter bankruptcy, liquidate their operations or consolidate, our revenues and collectability of receivables could be adversely affected.The demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases, affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our Commercial Risk Solutions, Reinsurance 7Solutions, and Data and Analytic Services revenue lines. The economic activity that impacts property and casualty insurance is most closely correlated with employment levels, corporate revenue, and asset values. Downward fluctuations in the year-over-year insurance premiums charged by insurers to protect against the same risk, referred to in the industry as softening of the insurance market, could adversely affect these businesses as a significant portion of the earnings are determined as a percentage of premium charged to our clients. Insolvencies and consolidations associated with an economic downturn, especially insolvencies in the insurance industry, could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business.  Also, error and omission claims against us, which we refer to as errors and omissions (“E&O”) claims, may increase in economic downturns, also adversely affecting our business.We face significant competitive pressures.As a global professional services firm, we compete with global, national, regional and local insurance companies who market and service their own products, other financial services providers, brokers, and investment managers, independent firms, and consulting organizations affiliated with accounting, information systems, technology, and financial services firms. We compete with respect to service, product features, price, commission structure, financial strength, ability to access certain insurance markets, and name recognition. Our competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources, larger customer bases, greater name recognition, more comprehensive products, stronger presence in certain geographies, or more established relationships with their customers and suppliers than we have. In addition, new competitors, alliances among competitors, or mergers of competitors could emerge and gain significant market share, and some of our competitors may have or may develop a lower cost structure, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, or provide services that gain greater market acceptance than the services that we offer or develop. Competitors may be able to respond to the need for technological changes and innovate faster, or price their services more aggressively. They may also compete for skilled professionals, finance acquisitions, fund internal growth, and compete for market share more effectively than we do. This competition is intensified by an industry trend where clients engage multiple brokers to service different portions of their accounts. If we fail to respond successfully to the competition we face, our financial condition or results of operations might be adversely affected. If our clients or third parties are not satisfied with our services, we may face additional cost, loss of profit opportunities, damage to our reputation, or legal liability.We depend, to a large extent, on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for high-quality advice and solutions focused on risk, retirement, and health.  If a client is not satisfied with our services, it could cause us to incur additional costs and impair profitability. Many of our clients are businesses that band together in industry groups or trade associations and actively share information among themselves about the quality of service they receive from their vendors. Accordingly, poor service to one client may negatively impact our relationships with multiple other clients. Moreover, if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, we could be subject to legal liability or loss of client relationships.The nature of much of our work involves assumptions and estimates concerning future events, the actual outcome of which we cannot know with certainty in advance. In our investment consulting business, we may be measured based on our track record regarding judgments and advice on investments that are susceptible to influences unknown at the time the advice was given. In addition, we could make computational, software programming, or data entry or management errors. A client may claim it suffered losses due to reliance on our consulting advice, which poses risks of liability exposure and costs of defense and increased insurance premiums.  In addition, claims arising from our professional services may produce publicity that could hurt our reputation and business and adversely affect our ability to secure new business.Damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our reputation is a key asset of the Company. We advise our clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, financial condition, and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters or others could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential clients, which could make it difficult for us to attract new clients and maintain existing ones.  Negative public opinion could also result from actual or alleged conduct by us or those currently or formerly associated with us in any number of activities or circumstances, the use and protection of data and systems, satisfaction of client expectations, and regulatory compliance.  This damage to our reputation could affect the confidence of our clients, rating agencies, regulators, stockholders, and third parties in transactions that are important to our business adversely effecting on our business, financial condition, and operating results.8Revenues from commission arrangements may fluctuate due to many factors, including cyclical or permanent changes in the insurance and reinsurance markets outside of our control.Revenues from commission arrangements have historically been affected by significant fluctuations arising from uncertainties and changes in the industries in which we operate. A significant portion of our revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage. We have no control over premium rates, and our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction. The potential for changes in premium rates is significant, due to pricing cyclicality in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets.In addition to movements in premium rates, our ability to generate premium-based commission revenue may be challenged by:•the growing availability of alternative methods for clients to meet their risk-protection needs, including a greater willingness on the part of corporations to “self-insure,” the use of so-called “captive” insurers, and the development of capital markets-based solutions and other alternative capital sources for traditional insurance and reinsurance needs that increase market capacity, increase competition and put pressure on pricing; •fluctuation in the need for insurance as the economic downturn continues, as clients either go out of business or scale back their operations, and thus reduce the amount of insurance, they procure;•the level of compensation, as a percentage of premium, that insurance carriers are willing to compensate brokers for placement activity;•the growing desire of clients to move away from variable commission rates and instead compensate brokers based upon flat fees, which can negatively impact us as fees are not generally indexed for inflation and do not automatically increase with premium as does commission-based compensation; and•competition from insurers seeking to sell their products directly to consumers, including online sales, without the involvement of an insurance broker.The profitability of our consulting engagements with clients may not meet our expectations due to unexpected costs, cost overruns, early contract terminations, unrealized assumptions used in our contract bidding process or the inability to maintain our prices. Our profitability with respect to consulting engagements is highly dependent upon our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency. As we adapt to changes in our business, adapt to the regulatory environment, enter into new engagements, acquire additional businesses, and take on new employees in new locations, we may not be able to manage our large, diverse and changing workforce, control our costs, or improve our efficiency.Our profit margin, and therefore our profitability, is largely a function of the rates we are able to charge for our services and the staffing costs for our personnel. Accordingly, if we are not able to maintain the rates we charge for our services or appropriately manage the staffing costs of our personnel, we may not be able to sustain our profit margin and our profitability will suffer. The prices we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors, including competitive factors, cost of living adjustment provisions, the extent of ongoing clients’ perception of our ability to add value through our services, and general economic conditions. If we cannot drive suitable cost efficiencies, our profit margins will suffer. Our cost efficiencies may be impacted by factors such as our ability to transition consultants from completed projects to new assignments, our ability to secure new consulting engagements, our ability to forecast demand for consulting services (and, consequently, appropriately manage the size and location of our workforce), employee attrition, and the need to devote time and resources to training and professional and business development.In our investment consulting business, we advise or act on behalf of clients regarding their investments. The results of these investments are uncertain and subject to numerous factors, some of which are within our control and some which are not. Clients that experience losses or lower than expected investment returns may leave us for competitors and/or assert claims against us.Our investment consulting business provides advice to clients on: investment strategy, which can include advice on setting investment objectives, asset allocation, and hedging strategies; selection (or removal) of investment managers; the investment in different investment instruments and products; and the selection of other investment service providers such as custodians and transition managers. For some clients, we are responsible for making decisions on these matters and we may implement such decisions in a fiduciary or agency capacity without assuming title or custody over the underlying funds or assets invested. Asset classes may experience poor absolute performance and third parties we recommend or select, such as investment managers, may underperform their benchmarks due to poor market performance, negligence, or other reasons, resulting in poor investment returns or losses. These losses may be attributable in whole or in part to failures on our part or to events entirely outside of our control. Regardless of the cause, clients experiencing losses may assert claims against us, and these claims may be for significant amounts. Defending against these claims can involve potentially significant costs, including legal defense costs, as well as cause substantial distraction and diversion of other resources. Furthermore, our ability to limit our potential liability is restricted in certain jurisdictions 9and in connection with claims involving breaches of fiduciary or agency duties or other alleged errors or omissions. Additionally, clients experiencing losses or lower than expected investment returns may leave us for our competitors.Financial RisksWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows.We face exposure to adverse movements in exchange rates of currencies other than our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, as a significant portion of our business is located outside of the U.S. These exposures may change over time, and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. Approximately 56% of our consolidated revenue is non-U.S., attributed on the basis of where the services are performed, and the exposures created can have significant currency volatility.  These currency exchange fluctuations create risk in both the translation of the financial results of our global subsidiaries into U.S. dollars for our consolidated financial statements, as well as in those of our operations that receive revenue and incur expenses other than in their respective local currencies, which can reduce the profitability of our operations based on the direction the respective currencies’ exchange rates move.  A decrease in the value of certain currencies relative to other currencies could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that benefit to a greater degree from a specific exchange rate move and can, as a result, deliver services at a lower cost or receive greater revenues from such a transaction. Although we use various derivative financial instruments to help protect against adverse foreign exchange rate fluctuations, we cannot eliminate such risks, and, as a result, changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results.  For example, the strengthening of the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies might adversely affect the value of our products and services when translated to U.S. dollar, even if the value of such products and services has not changed in their original currency.Changes in interest rates and deterioration of credit quality could reduce the value of our cash balances and investment portfolios and adversely affect our financial condition or results.Operating funds available for corporate use were $1,285 million at December 31, 2017 and are reported in Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments. Funds held on behalf of clients and insurers were $3.7 billion at December 31, 2017 and are reported in Fiduciary assets. We also carry an investment portfolio of other long-term investments. As of December 31, 2017, these long-term investments had a carrying value of $57 million.  Adverse changes in interest rates, performance, and counterparty credit quality, including default, could reduce the value of these funds and investments, thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results. We may experience reduced investment earnings on our cash and short-term investments of fiduciary and operating funds if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain at or near their current low levels, or if negative yields on deposits or investments are experienced, as we have experienced in Japan and certain jurisdictions in the European Union. On the other hand, higher interest rates could result in a higher discount rate used by investors to value our future cash flows thereby resulting in a lower valuation of the Company. In addition, during times of stress in the banking industry, counterparty risk can quickly escalate, potentially resulting in substantial losses for us as a result of our cash or other investments with such counterparties, as well as substantial losses for our clients and the insurance companies with which we work.Our pension obligations and value of our pension assets could adversely affect our shareholders’ equity, net income, cash flow and liquidity.To the extent that the pension obligations associated with our pension plans continue to exceed the fair value of the assets supporting those obligations, our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected. In particular, lower interest rates and investment returns could result in the present value of plan liabilities increasing at a greater rate than the value of plan assets, resulting in higher unfunded positions in our pension plans.  In addition, the periodic revision of pension assumptions or variances of actual results from our assumptions can materially change the present value of expected future benefits, and therefore the funded status of the plans and resulting net periodic pension expense. As a result, we may experience future changes in the funded status of our plans that could require us to make additional cash contributions beyond those that have been estimated and which could adversely affect shareholders’ equity, net income, cash flow and liquidity.Our worldwide pension plans are significant, and therefore our pension contributions and expense are sensitive to various market and demographic factors. These factors include equity and bond market returns, fair value of pension assets, the assumed interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities, foreign exchange rates, rates of inflation, mortality assumptions, potential regulatory and legal changes and counterparty exposure from various investments and derivative contracts, including annuities. Variations in any of these factors could cause significant changes to our financial position and results of operations from year to year. In addition, contributions are generally based on statutory requirements and local funding practices, which may differ from measurements under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”).10We have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility.As of December 31, 2017, we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately $6.0 billion. The level of debt outstanding could adversely affect our financial flexibility by reducing our ability to use cash from operations for other purposes, including working capital, dividends to shareholders, share repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. We also are subject to risks that, at the time any of our outstanding debt matures, we will not be able to retire or refinance the debt on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.As of December 31, 2017, we had two committed credit facilities outstanding. Each of these facilities is intended to support our commercial paper obligations and our general working capital needs. In addition, each of these facilities included customary representations, warranties and covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios of adjusted consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense and consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated EBITDA, tested quarterly.  A substantial portion of our outstanding debt, including certain intercompany debt obligations, contains financial and other covenants. The terms of these covenants may limit our ability to obtain, or increase the costs of obtaining, additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate requirements. This in turn may have the impact of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, thereby placing us at a relative disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness, or fewer or less onerous covenants associated with such indebtedness, and making us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions.If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business. Additionally, we may not be able to effect such actions or refinance any of our debt, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.A decline in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper may adversely affect our borrowing costs, access to capital, and financial flexibility.A downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper could increase our borrowing costs, reduce or eliminate our access to capital, reduce our financial flexibility, and limit our ability to implement on corporate strategy. Our senior debt ratings at December 31, 2017 were A- with a stable outlook (Standard & Poor’s, or “S&P”), BBB+ with a stable outlook (Fitch, Inc., or “Fitch”), and Baa2 with a stable outlook (Moody’s Investor Services, or “Moody’s”). Our commercial paper ratings were A-2 (S&P), F-2 (Fitch) and P-2 (Moody’s).Real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect any trading market for, or trading value of, our securities.  Such changes could result from any number of factors, including the modification by a credit rating agency of the criteria or methodology it applies to particular issuers, a change in the agency’s view of us or our industry, or as a consequence of actions we take to implement our corporate strategies.  A change in our credit rating could adversely limit our access to capital and our competitive position.The benefits of our Redomestication may not be realized or may be offset in whole or in part by factors that we do not control.In 2012, we reincorporated in the U.K. and moved our corporate headquarters to London (the “Redomestication”). As a result of this reorganization of our corporate structure, Aon plc became the publicly-held parent company of the Aon group.  There can be no assurance that all of the goals of our Redomestication will be achievable. Our effective tax rates and the benefits from our Redomestication are subject to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our ability to control, such as changes in the rate of economic growth in the U.K., the U.S. and other countries, the financial performance of our business in various jurisdictions, currency exchange rate fluctuations (especially as between the British pound and the U.S. dollar), and significant changes in trade, monetary or fiscal policies of the U.K. or the U.S., including changes in interest rates. The impact of these factors, individually and in the aggregate, is difficult to predict, in part because the occurrence of the events or circumstances may be interrelated and the impact to us of the occurrence of any one of these events or circumstances could be compounded or, alternatively, reduced, offset, or more than offset, by the occurrence of one or more of the other events or circumstances described in such factors.On September 4, 2013, we received from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) an executed Closing Agreement pursuant to which the Company and the IRS agreed that the merger (pursuant to which the Redomestication occurred) did not cause Aon plc to be treated as a U.S. domestic corporation for federal tax purposes. This agreement substantially reduced the risk that actions taken to date might cause Aon plc to be treated as a U.S. domestic corporation for federal tax purposes under the current tax statute and regulations. However, the U.S. Congress, the IRS, the U.K. Parliament or U.K. tax authorities may enact new statutory or regulatory provisions that could adversely affect our status as a non-U.S. corporation, or otherwise adversely affect our anticipated global tax position. Retroactive statutory or regulatory actions have occurred in the past, and there can be no assurance that any 11such provisions, if enacted or promulgated, would not have retroactive application to us, the Redomestication or any subsequent actions. Our net income and cash flow would be reduced if we were to be subject to U.S. corporate income tax as a domestic corporation. In addition, any future amendments to the current income tax treaties between the U.K and other jurisdictions (including the U.S.), or any new statutory or regulatory provisions that might limit our ability to take advantage of any such treaties, could subject us to increased taxation.U.S. federal income tax reform could create uncertainty and adversely affect our business and financial condition.On December 22, 2017, U.S. federal tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”), was signed into law, significantly changing the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. These changes include, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate, subjecting certain future foreign subsidiary earnings, whether or not distributed, to U.S. tax under a Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income provision, imposing a new alternative “Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax” on U.S. corporations that limits deductions for certain amounts payable to foreign affiliates, imposing significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest payable to related and unrelated lenders, further limiting deductible executive compensation, and imposing a one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries through the end of 2017. We continue to analyze how the Tax Reform Act may  impact our results of operations.  The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act. The Company has recognized the provisional tax impacts related to deemed repatriated earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and included these amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. The ultimate impact may differ from these provisional amounts, possibly materially, due to, among other things, additional analysis of the law, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions the Company may take as a result of the Tax Reform Act. This continued analysis and resulting uncertainty, along with many of the changes effected pursuant to the Tax Reform Act, may have an adverse or volatile effect on our tax rate in fiscal years 2018 and beyond, thereby affecting our results of operations. Our global effective tax rate is subject to a variety of different factors, which could create volatility in that tax rate, expose us to greater than anticipated tax liabilities or cause us to adjust previously recognized tax assets and liabilities.We are subject to income taxes in the U.K., U.S. and many other jurisdictions. As a result, our global effective tax rate from period to period can be affected by many factors, including changes in tax legislation, such as the U.S. Tax Reform Act detailed above, our global mix of earnings, the use of global funding structures, the tax characteristics of our income, the effect of complying with transfer pricing requirements under laws of many different countries on our revenues and costs, the consequences of acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and business segments, and the portion of the income of non-U.S. subsidiaries that may be subject to U.S. tax whether or not distributed to U.S. shareholders. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes, and our determination of the amount of our tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities.We believe that our Redomestication and related transactions should support our ability to maintain a competitive global tax rate because the U.K. has implemented a dividend exemption system that generally does not subject non-U.K. earnings to U.K. tax when such earnings are repatriated to the U.K. in the form of dividends from non-U.K. subsidiaries. This should allow us to optimize our capital allocation through global funding structures. However, we cannot provide any assurances as to what our tax rate will be in any period because of, among other things, uncertainty regarding the nature and extent of our business activities in any particular jurisdiction in the future and the tax laws of such jurisdictions, as well as changes in U.S. and other tax laws, treaties and regulations. Our actual global tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material. Additionally, the tax laws of the U.K., the U.S. and other jurisdictions could change in the future, and such changes could cause a material change in our tax rate.We also could be subject to future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities, and the resolution of such audits could impact our tax rate in future periods, as would any reclassification or other changes (such as those in applicable accounting rules) that increases the amounts we have provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that we would be successful in attempting to mitigate the adverse impacts resulting from any changes in law, audits and other matters. Our inability to mitigate the negative consequences of any changes in the law, audits and other matters could cause our global tax rate to increase, our use of cash to increase and our financial condition and results of operations to suffer.Changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. We are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including, 12but not limited to, those relating to revenue recognition, restructuring, pensions, recoverability of assets including customer receivables, valuation of goodwill and intangibles, contingencies, share-based payments, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances. These assumptions and estimates involve the exercise of judgment and discretion, which may evolve over time in light of operational experience, regulatory direction, developments in accounting principles, and other factors. Actual results could differ from these estimates, or changes in assumptions, estimates, policies, or developments in the business may change our initial estimates, which could materially affect the Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Financial Position, Shareholders’ Equity and Cash Flows.We may be required to record goodwill or other long-lived asset impairment charges, which could result in a significant charge to earnings.Under U.S. GAAP, we review our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or other long-lived assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our share price or market capitalization, reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry. We may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or other long-lived assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and other long-lied intangible assets. Future goodwill or other long-lived asset impairment charges could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.We are a holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends or other payments in needed amounts from our subsidiaries.The Company is organized as a holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating entities. As a holding company without significant operations of its own, our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our subsidiaries.  We rely on dividends, interest, and other payments from these subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt, paying dividends to shareholders, repurchasing ordinary shares, and corporate expenses.  Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate or other restrictions that may limit the amounts that subsidiaries can pay in dividends or other payments to us. No assurance can be given that there will not be further changes in law, regulatory actions, or other circumstances that could restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise make payment to us.  Furthermore, no assurance can be given that our subsidiaries may be able to make timely payments to us in order for us to meet our obligations.Legal and Regulatory RisksWe are subject to errors and omissions claims against us as well as other contingencies and legal proceedings, some of which, if determined unfavorably to us, could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of a business line or the Company as a whole.We assist our clients with various matters, including placing insurance and reinsurance coverage and handling related claims, consulting on various human resources matters, providing actuarial services, investment consulting, and asset management services.  E&O claims against us may allege our potential liability for damages arising from these services. E&O claims could include, for example, the failure of our employees or sub-agents, whether negligently or intentionally, to place coverage correctly or notify carriers of claims on behalf of clients or to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured, or the failure to give error-free advice in our consulting business. It is not always possible to prevent and detect errors and omissions, and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases. In addition, we are subject to other types of claims, litigation and proceedings in the ordinary course of business, which along with E&O claims, may seek damages, including punitive damages, in amounts that could, if awarded, have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, earnings, and cash flows. In addition to potential liability for monetary damages, such claims or outcomes could harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business.We have historically purchased, and intend to continue to purchase, insurance to cover E&O claims and other insurance to provide protection against certain losses that arise in such matters. However, we have exhausted or materially depleted our coverage under some of the policies that protect us for certain years and, consequently, are self-insured or materially self-insured for some historical claims. Accruals for these exposures, and related insurance receivables, when applicable, have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable. These accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as developments warrant, and may also be adversely affected by disputes we may have with our insurers over coverage. Amounts related to settlement provisions are recorded in Other general expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Discussion of some of these claims, lawsuits, and proceedings are contained in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.In addition, we provide a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to our customers and others. The maximum potential amount of future payments represents the notional amounts that could become payable under the guarantees and indemnifications 13if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties, without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or other methods. Any anticipated payment amounts under guarantees and indemnifications that are deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable are included in our consolidated financial statements. These amounts may not represent actual future payments, if any, for these guarantees and indemnifications.The ultimate outcome of these claims, lawsuits, proceedings, guarantees and indemnifications cannot be ascertained, and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us. It is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters.Our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which could reduce our profitability, limit our growth, or increase competition.Our businesses are subject to extensive legal and regulatory oversight throughout the world, including the U.K. Companies Act and the rules and regulations promulgated by the FCA, the U.S. securities laws, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, and a variety of other laws, rules and regulations addressing, among other things, licensing, data privacy and protection, trade restriction and export controls, anti-money laundering, wage-and-hour standards, employment and labor relations, anti-competition, anti-corruption, currency, reserves, government contracting and the amount of local investment with respect to our operations in certain countries.  This legal and regulatory oversight could reduce our profitability or limit our growth by: increasing the costs of legal and regulatory compliance; limiting or restricting the products or services we sell, the markets we serve or enter, the methods by which we sell our products and services, the prices we can charge for our services, or the form of compensation we can accept from our clients, carriers and third parties; or by subjecting our businesses to the possibility of legal and regulatory actions or proceedings.The global nature of our operations increases the complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations adding to our cost of doing business.  In addition, many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions, increasing the complexity and cost of compliance.  In emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less developed legal systems, local laws and regulations may not be established with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us adequate assurance that we are operating our business in a compliant manner with all required licenses or that our rights are otherwise protected. In addition, certain laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance provisions of the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act (“FATCA”) in the U.S., and the Bribery Act of 2010 (“U.K. Bribery Act”) in the U.K., impact our operations outside of the legislating country by imposing requirements for the conduct of overseas operations, and in several cases, requiring compliance by foreign subsidiaries.In addition to the complexity of the laws and regulations themselves, the development of new laws and regulations or changes in application or interpretation of current laws and regulations also increases our legal and regulatory compliance complexity. Additionally, our acquisitions of new businesses and our continued operational changes and entry into new jurisdictions and new service offerings increases our legal and regulatory compliance complexity, as well as the type of governmental oversight to which we may be subject.  Changes in laws and regulations could mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions, could impose additional licensure requirements or costs to our operations and services, or even cause us to cease offering certain services or solutions. Furthermore, as we enter new jurisdictions or businesses and further develop and expand our services, we may become subject to additional types of laws and policies and governmental oversight and supervision, such as those applicable to the financial lending or other service institutions.In all jurisdictions, the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities. Generally, such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant, renew, and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations. Accordingly, we may have a license revoked or be unable to obtain new licenses and therefore be precluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on or developing some or all of our activities or otherwise fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction. No assurances can be given that our business can further develop or continue to be conducted in any given jurisdiction as it has been conducted in the past.In addition, new regulatory or industry developments could result in changes that adversely affect us. These developments include:•changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory actions or changes;•the establishment of programs in which state-sponsored entities provide property insurance in catastrophe-prone areas or other alternative types of coverage;•changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans, defined contribution, and defined benefit plans, and investment consulting and asset management;•additional regulations promulgated by the FCA in the U.K., or other regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which we operate; or14•additional requirements respecting data privacy, data security, and data usage in jurisdictions in which we operate that may increase our costs of compliance and potentially reduce the manner in which data can be used by us to develop or further our product offerings.Changes in the regulatory scheme, or even changes in how existing regulations are interpreted, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations by limiting revenue streams or increasing costs of compliance. For instance, The General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), effective in May 2018, creates a range of new compliance obligations, increases financial penalties for non-compliance, and extends the scope of the European Union data protection law to all companies processing data of European Union residents, wherever the company’s location. Complying with the GDPR will cause us to incur substantial operational costs and may require us to change our business practices.Our business’ regulatory oversight generally also includes licensing of insurance brokers and agents, managing general agency or general underwriting operations, and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Our continuing ability to provide insurance broking in the jurisdictions in which we operate depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions. Also, we can be affected indirectly by the governmental regulation and supervision of insurance companies. For instance, if we are providing or managing general underwriting services for an insurer, we may have to contend with regulations affecting our client.Services provided in our Health Solutions and Retirement Solutions revenue line are also the subject of ever-evolving government regulation, either because the services provided to our clients are regulated directly or because third parties upon whom we rely to provide services to clients are regulated, thereby indirectly affecting the manner in which we provide services to those clients.  In particular, our health care exchange business depends upon the private sector of the U.S. insurance system and its role in financing health care delivery, and insurance carriers’ use of, and payment of, commissions to, agents, brokers and other organizations to market and sell individual and family health insurance products and plans. Uncertainty regarding, or any changes to, state or federal law, or the interpretation of such law by applicable regulatory agencies, including the effects of health care reform by the U.S. government, could delay client adoption of our healthcare exchanges, impair our ability to retain clients who have adopted our healthcare exchanges, or cause insurance carriers to alter or eliminate the products and plans that they offer or attempt to move members into new products or plans for which we receive lower commissions.  In addition, changes in laws, government regulations or the way those regulations are interpreted in the jurisdictions in which we operate could affect the viability, value, use, or delivery of benefits and human resources programs, including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans (such as medical), defined contribution plans (such as 401(k)), or defined benefit plans (such as pension), may adversely affect the demand for, or profitability of, our services.If we violate the laws and regulation to which we are subject, we could be subject to fines, penalties or criminal sanctions and could be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries.  There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate these laws and regulations, causing an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.In addition, our businesses and operations are subject to heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to additional regulatory investigations, increased government involvement, or enforcement actions. For instance, increased scrutiny by competition authorities may increase our costs of doing business or force us to change the way we conduct business or refrain from or otherwise alter the way we engage in certain activities. Additionally, we operate in many different business lines, which may occasionally intersect with each other, such as placing both insurance and reinsurance or providing both investment consultancy and fiduciary management services.   If we fail to control possible resulting conflicts of interest, we could be subject to civil litigation, fines, penalties or criminal sanctions and could be prohibited from participating in one or more lines of business.  As regulators and other government agencies continue to examine our operations, there is no assurance that consent orders or other enforcement actions will not be issued by them in the future. These and other initiatives from national, state, and local officials may subject us to judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause us to be required to restructure or divest operations and activities, all of which could lead to reputational issues, higher operational costs, business disruption, or loss, thereby adversely affecting our business, financial condition, or operating results.Failure to protect our intellectual property rights, or allegations that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others, could harm our reputation, ability to compete effectively, and financial condition.To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on a combination of trademark laws, copyright laws, patent laws, trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements, and other contractual arrangements with our affiliates, employees, clients, strategic partners, and others. However, the protective steps that we take may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights.  Further, effective trademark, copyright, patent, and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer our services or competitors may develop products similar to our products that do not conflict with our related intellectual property rights. Failure to protect our intellectual property adequately could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively.15In addition, to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, we may initiate litigation against third parties, such as infringement suits or interference proceedings.  Third parties may assert intellectual property rights claims against us, which may be costly to defend, could require the payment of damages and could limit our ability to use or offer certain technologies, products or other intellectual property. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be expensive, take significant time and divert management’s attention from other business concerns. Successful challenges against us could require us to modify or discontinue our use of technology or business processes where such use is found to infringe or violate the rights of others, or require us to purchase licenses from third parties, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.We have less flexibility as a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales with respect to certain aspects of capital management.English law imposes additional restrictions on certain corporate actions.  For example, English law provides that a board of directors may only allot, or issue, securities with the prior authorization of shareholders, such authorization being up to the aggregate nominal amount of shares and for a maximum period of five years, each as specified in the articles of association or relevant shareholder resolution. The current authorization is effective until the earlier of our next annual general meeting or August 31, 2018.  This authorization will need to be renewed by our shareholders periodically and we intend to renew this authorization at each annual general meeting.English law also generally provides shareholders with preemptive rights when new shares are issued for cash; however, it is possible for the articles of association, or shareholders in general meeting, to exclude preemptive rights. Such an exclusion of preemptive rights may be for a maximum period of up to five years as specified in the articles of association or relevant shareholder resolution. The current exclusion is effective until the earlier of our next annual general meeting or August 31, 2018.  This exclusion would need to be renewed by our shareholders periodically and we intend to renew this exclusion at each annual general meeting.English law also requires us to have available “distributable reserves” to make share repurchases or pay dividends to shareholders.  Distributable reserves may be created through the earnings of the U.K. parent company or other actions.  As of December 31, 2017, we had distributable reserves in excess of $1.2 billion.  While it is our intention to maintain a sufficient level of distributable reserves in order to pay dividends on our ordinary shares and make share repurchases, there is no assurance that the parent company level will continue to generate sufficient earnings in order to maintain the necessary level of distributable reserves to do so.English law also generally prohibits a company from repurchasing its own shares by way of “off market purchases” without the prior approval of our shareholders. Such approval lasts for a maximum period of up to five years. Our shares are traded on the NYSE, which is not a recognized investment exchange in the U.K. Consequently, any repurchase of our shares is currently considered an “off market purchase.”  The current authorization expires on June 17, 2020.  Renewal of this authorization will be sought periodically.The enforcement of civil liabilities against us may be more difficult.Because we are a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, investors could experience more difficulty enforcing judgments obtained against us in U.S. courts than would have been the case for a U.S. company. In addition, it may be more difficult (or impossible) to bring some types of claims against us in courts in England than it would be to bring similar claims against a U.S. company in a U.S. court.We are a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Therefore, it may not be possible to effect service of process upon us within the U.S. in order to enforce judgments of U.S. courts against us based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws.There is doubt as to the enforceability in England and Wales, in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts, of civil liabilities solely based on the U.S. federal securities laws. The English courts will, however, treat any amount payable by us under U.S. judgment as a debt and new proceedings can be commenced in the English courts to enforce this debt against us. The following criteria must be satisfied in order for the English court to enforce the debt created by the U.S. judgment:•the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of laws principles and rules of English private international law at the time when proceedings were initiated; •the U.S. proceedings not having been brought in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause except with the agreement of the defendant or the defendant’s subsequent submission to the jurisdiction of the court; •the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money; 16•the recognition or enforcement, as the case may be, of the U.S. judgment not contravening English public policy in a sufficiently significant way or contravening the Human Rights Act 1998 (or any subordinate legislation made thereunder, to the extent applicable); •the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine, or otherwise based on a U.S. law that an English court considers to be a penal or revenue law; •the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained, and not otherwise being a judgment contrary to section 5 of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 or is a judgment based on measures designated by the Secretary of State under Section 1 of that Act; •the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural justice; •the U.S. judgment not being a judgment on a matter previously determined by an English court, or another court whose judgment is entitled to recognition (or enforcement as the case may be) in England, in proceedings involving the same parties which conflicts with an earlier judgment of such court; •the party seeking enforcement (being a party who is not ordinarily resident in some part of the U.K. or resident in an EU Member State) providing security for costs, if ordered to do so by the English courts; and •the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within the relevant limitation period.If an English court gives judgment for the sum payable under a U.S. judgment, the English judgment will be enforceable by methods generally available for this purpose. These methods generally permit the English court discretion to prescribe the manner of enforcement. Also note that, in any enforcement proceedings, the judgment debtor may raise any counterclaim that could have been brought if the action had been originally brought in England unless the subject of the counterclaim was in issue and denied in the U.S. proceedings.Operational RisksThe economic and political conditions of the countries and regions in which we operate could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity, and prospects for growth.Our operations in countries undergoing political change or experiencing economic instability are subject to uncertainty and risks that could materially adversely affect our business.  These risks include, particularly in emerging markets, the possibility we would be subject to undeveloped or evolving legal systems, unstable governments and economies, and potential governmental actions affecting the flow of goods, services, and currency.Furthermore, the U.K.’s withdrawal from the European Union (“Brexit”) has created uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.K. and the European Union as they negotiate the terms of the withdrawal.  As the U.K. and European Union negotiate these terms, we are uncertain about the agreements they will reach on topics such as financial laws and regulations, tax and free trade agreements, immigration laws, and employment laws.  Our publicly traded parent is incorporated in the U.K. and we have significant operations and a substantial workforce therein and therefore enjoy certain benefits based on the U.K.’s membership in the European Union.  The lack of clarity about Brexit and the future U.K. laws and regulations creates uncertainty for us as the outcome of these negotiations may affect our business and operations.   Additionally, there is also a risk that other countries may decide to leave the European Union. The uncertainty surrounding Brexit not only potentially affects our business in the U.K. and the European Union, but may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, any development that has the effect of devaluing or replacing the Euro could meaningfully reduce the value of our assets and reducing the usefulness of liquidity alternatives denominated in that currency such as our multicurrency U.S. credit facility. We also deposit some of our cash, including cash held in a fiduciary capacity, with certain European financial institutions. While we continuously monitor and manage exposures associated with those deposits, to the extent the uncertainty surrounding economic stability in Europe and the future viability of the Euro suddenly and adversely impacts those financial institutions, some or all of those cash deposits could be at risk.We may not realize all of the expected benefits from our restructuring plan and other operational improvement initiatives.In 2017, we initiated a global restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”) in connection with the sale of the Divested Business. The Restructuring Plan is intended to streamline operations across the organization and deliver greater efficiency, insight and connectivity.  We expect these restructuring activities and related expenses to affect continuing operations through 2019, including an estimated 4,200 to 4,800 role eliminations.  The Restructuring Plan is expected to result in cumulative costs of approximately $1,025 million through the end of the Restructuring Plan, consisting of approximately $450 million in employee termination costs, $130 million in IT rationalization costs, $85 million in real estate realization costs, $50 million in asset impairment costs and $310 million in other costs associated with the restructuring.   Included in the estimated $1,025 million is $50 million of estimated non-cash charges. 17We estimate that our annualized savings from the Restructuring Plan and other operational improvement initiatives will be approximately $450 million by the end of 2019. Actual total costs, savings and timing may vary from these estimates due to changes in the scope or assumptions underlying the Restructuring Plan and other operational improvement initiatives.  We therefore cannot assure that we will achieve the targeted savings. Unanticipated costs or unrealized savings in connection with the Restructuring Plan and other operational improvement initiatives could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.Our success depends on our ability to retain and attract experienced and qualified personnel, including our senior management team and other professional personnel.We depend, in material part, upon the members of our senior management team who possess extensive knowledge and a deep understanding of our business and our strategy, as well as the colleagues who are critical to developing and retaining client relationships. The unexpected loss of services of any of these senior leaders could have a disruptive effect adversely impacting our ability to manage our business effectively and execute our business strategy. Competition for experienced professional personnel is intense, and we are constantly working to retain and attract these professionals. If we cannot successfully do so, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. While we have plans for key management succession and long-term compensation plans designed to retain our senior management team and critical colleagues, if our succession plans and retention programs do not operate effectively, our business could be adversely affected.Our global operations expose us to various international risks that could adversely affect our business.Our operations are conducted globally. Accordingly, we are subject to legal, economic, and market risks associated with operating in, and sourcing from, foreign countries, including:•difficulties in staffing and managing our foreign offices, including due to unexpected wage inflation or job turnover, and the increased travel, infrastructure, and legal and compliance costs and risks associated with multiple international locations;•hyperinflation in certain foreign countries;•conflicting regulations in the countries in which we do business;•imposition of investment requirements or other restrictions by foreign governments;•longer payment cycles;•greater difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;•insufficient demand for our services in foreign jurisdictions;•our ability to execute effective and efficient cross-border sourcing of services on behalf of our clients;•the reliance on or use of third parties to perform services on behalf of the Company;•disparate tax regimes;•restrictions on the import and export of technologies; and•trade barriers.The occurrence of natural or man-made disasters could result in declines in business and increases in claims that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We are exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes, climate events or weather patterns, and pandemic health events, as well as man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism, military actions and cyber-terrorism. The continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, and a natural or man-made disaster could trigger an economic downturn in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster. These consequences could, among other things, result in a decline in business and increased claims from those areas. They could also result in reduced underwriting capacity, making it more difficult for our professionals to place business. Disasters also could disrupt public and private infrastructure, including communications and financial services, which could disrupt our normal business operations.A natural or man-made disaster also could disrupt the operations of our counterparties or result in increased prices for the products and services they provide to us. In addition, a disaster could adversely affect the value of the assets in our investment portfolio. Finally, a natural or man-made disaster could increase the incidence or severity of E&O claims against us.Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our personnel, offices and technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations. Should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as an earthquake, hurricane, terrorist attack, pandemic, security breaches, power loss, telecommunications failure, or other natural or man-made disaster, our continued success will depend, in part, on the availability of our personnel, our office facilities, and the proper functioning of existing, new or upgraded computer 18systems, telecommunications, and other related systems and operations. In events like these, while our operational size, the multiple locations from which we operate, and our existing back-up systems provide us with some degree of flexibility, we still can experience near-term operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations. We could potentially lose access to key executives, personnel, or client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario. A disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions, or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships, or legal liability.We rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business. Any significant system or network disruption due to a breach in the security of our information technology systems could have a negative impact on our reputation, operations, sales and operating results.We rely on the efficient, uninterrupted, and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks, some of which are within the Company and some of which are outsourced to third parties. All information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including but not limited to cyber-attacks, computer viruses, security breaches, unauthorized access or improper actions by insiders or employees.  We are at risk of attack by a growing list of adversaries through increasingly sophisticated methods of attack.  Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures.  We regularly experience attacks to our systems and networks and have from time to time experienced cybersecurity breaches, such as computer viruses, unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems, and similar incidents, which to date have not had a material impact on our business.  If we are unable to efficiently and effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards, we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access. While we select our third party vendors carefully, problems with the information technology systems of those vendors, including breakdowns or other disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, cyber-attacks, and security breaches at a vendor could adversely affect the Company’s ability to deliver products and services to its customers and otherwise conduct its business.  Additionally, we are an acquisitive organization and the process of integrating the information systems of the businesses we acquire is complex and exposes us to additional risk as we might not adequately identify weaknesses in the targets’ information systems, which could expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems more vulnerable to attack. These types of incidents affecting us or our third-party vendors could result in intellectual property or other confidential information being lost or stolen, including client, employee, or company data.  In addition, we may not be able to detect breaches in our information technology systems or assess the severity or impact of a breach in a timely manner.We have implemented various measures to manage our risks related to system and network security and disruptions, but a security breach or a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients, adversely impact our operations, sales and operating results, and require us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve such issues. Additionally, in order to maintain the level of security, service, and reliability that our clients require, we may be required to make significant additional investments in our information technology system.Improper disclosure of confidential, personal, or proprietary data could result in regulatory scrutiny, legal liability, or harm to our reputation.One of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our employees’ and clients’ confidential and proprietary information, including confidential information about our clients’ employees’ compensation, medical information, and other personally identifiable information. We maintain policies, procedures, and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information. Nonetheless, we cannot eliminate the risk of human error, employee or vendor malfeasance, or cyber-attacks that could result in improper access to or disclosure of confidential, personal, or proprietary information. Such access or disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws and regulations that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs, loss of revenue, and loss of clients. The release of confidential information as a result of a security breach could also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals or business partners, or by regulators, and the outcome of such proceedings, which could include penalties or fines, could have a significant negative impact on our business.In many jurisdictions, including in the European Union and the U.S., we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the collection, use, retention, security, and transfer of this information.  These laws and regulations are frequently changing and are becoming increasingly complex and sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services both in terms of substance and in terms of enforceability. This makes compliance challenging and expensive. Additionally, certain jurisdictions’ regulations include notice provisions that may require us to inform affected clients or employees in the event of a breach of confidential information before we fully understand or appreciate the extent of the breach. These notice provisions 19present operational challenges and related risk.  In particular, the European Union’s GDPR will go into effect in May 2018.  Despite our efforts to bring practices into compliance before the GDPR’s effective date, we may not be successful either due to internal or external factors, such as a lack of vendor cooperation. Non-compliance could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others and additional costs in connection therewith. We may also experience difficulty retaining or obtaining new European or multi-national customers due to the compliance cost, potential risk exposure, and difficulty in negotiating the allocation of risk related to the handling of data. Compliance with the GDPR may also cause distraction from other aspects of our business. Our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impair our reputation in the marketplace. Further, regulatory initiatives in the area of data protection are more frequently including provisions allowing authorities to impose substantial fines and penalties, and therefore, failure to comply could also have a significant financial impact.Our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to effectively apply technology in driving value for our clients through technology-based solutions or gain internal efficiencies through the effective application of technology and related tools. Conversely, investments in innovative product offerings may fail to yield sufficient return to cover their investments.Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and implement technology solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology, industry standards, and client preferences. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and cost-effective basis, and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace. Additionally, the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses. If we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors or if our competitors develop more cost-effective technologies, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and complete client engagements. For example, we have invested significantly in the development of our proprietary databases, repositories of global insurance and reinsurance placement information, which we use to drive results for our clients in the insurance and reinsurance placement process. Our competitors are developing competing databases, and their success in this space may impact our ability to differentiate our services to our clients through the use of unique technological solutions. Innovations in software, cloud computing or other technologies that alter how our services are delivered could significantly undermine our investment in this business if we are slow or unable to take advantage of these developments.We are continually developing and investing in innovative and novel service offerings that we believe will address needs that we identify in the markets. Nevertheless, for those efforts to produce meaningful value, we are reliant on a number of other factors, some of which our outside of our control. For example, our Health Solutions revenue line has invested substantial time and resources in launching health care exchanges under the belief that these exchanges will serve a useful role in helping corporations and individuals in the U.S. manage their growing health care expenses. In order for these exchanges to be successful, health care insurers and corporate and individual participants have to deem them suitable, and whether those parties will find them suitable will be subject to their own particular circumstances.We rely on third parties to perform key functions of our business operations enabling our provision of services to our clients. These third parties may act in ways that could harm our business.We rely on third parties, and in some cases subcontractors, to provide services, data, and information such as technology, information security, funds transfers, data processing, and administration and support functions that are critical to the operations of our business.  These third parties include correspondents, agents and other brokerage and intermediaries, insurance markets, data providers, plan trustees, payroll service providers, benefits administrators, software and system vendors, health plan providers, investment managers and providers of human resource, among others.  As we do not fully control the actions of these third parties, we are subject to the risk that their decisions, actions, or inactions may adversely impact us and replacing these service providers could create significant delay and expense.  A failure by third parties to comply with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements, in a high quality and timely manner, particularly during periods of our peak demand for their services, could result in economic and reputational harm to us.  In addition, these third parties face their own technology, operating, business, and economic risks, and any significant failures by them, including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client, employee, or company information, could cause harm to our reputation.  An interruption in or the cessation of service by any service provider as a result of systems failures, capacity constraints, financial difficulties, or for any other reason could disrupt our operations, impact our ability to offer certain products and services, and result in contractual or regulatory penalties, liability claims from clients and/or employees, damage to our reputation, and harm to our business.Our business is exposed to risks associated with the handling of client funds.Certain of our businesses collect premiums from insureds and remits the premiums to the respective insurers. We also collect claims or refunds from insurers on behalf of insureds, which are then remitted to the insureds. Consequently, at any given time, we may be holding and managing funds of our clients. This function creates a risk of loss arising from, among other things, fraud by employees or third parties, execution of unauthorized transactions, errors relating to transaction processing, or other 20cybersecurity events or security breaches. We are also potentially at risk in the event the financial institution in which we hold these funds suffers any kind of insolvency or liquidity event. The occurrence of any of these types of events in connection with this function could cause us financial loss and reputational harm.In connection with the implementation of our corporate strategies, we face risks associated with the acquisition or disposition of businesses, the entry into new lines of business, the integration of acquired businesses, and the growth and development of these businesses.In pursuing our corporate strategy, we often acquire other businesses or dispose of or exit businesses we currently own. The success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate acquisition and disposition targets, negotiate transactions on favorable terms, complete transactions and, in the case of acquisitions, successfully integrate them into our existing businesses. If a proposed transaction is not consummated, the time and resources spent pursuing it could adversely result in missed opportunities to locate and acquire other businesses. If acquisitions are made, there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, including, but not limited to, revenue growth, operational efficiencies, or expected synergies. If we dispose of or otherwise exit certain businesses, there can be no assurance that we will not incur certain disposition related charges, or that we will be able to reduce overhead related to the divested assets.From time to time, either through acquisitions or internal development, we enter new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. These new lines of business or new products and services present the Company with additional risks, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed.  Such risks include the investment of significant time and resources; the possibility that these efforts will be not be successful; the possibility that the marketplace does not accept our products or services or that we are unable to retain clients that adopt our new products or services; and the risk of additional liabilities associated with these efforts. In addition, many of the businesses that we acquire and develop will likely have significantly smaller scales of operations prior to the implementation of our growth strategy. If we are not able to manage the growing complexity of these businesses, including improving, refining, or revising our systems and operational practices, and enlarging the scale and scope of the businesses, our business may be adversely affected. Other risks include developing knowledge of and experience in the new business, integrating the acquired business into our systems and culture, recruiting professionals, and developing and capitalizing on new relationships with experienced market participants. External factors, such as compliance with new or revised regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business.  Failure to manage these risks in the acquisition or development of new businesses could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in connection with the sale of our Benefits Administration and HR Business Process Outsourcing business.On February 9, 2017, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Tempo Acquisition, LLC to sell our Divested Business to the Buyer, an entity controlled by affiliates of The Blackstone Group L.P. On May 1, 2017, the transaction was consummated and the Buyer purchased all of the outstanding equity interests in each of the Divested Business’s subsidiaries, plus certain related assets, for a purchase price of (i) $4.3 billion in cash paid at closing, subject to customary adjustments set forth in the Purchase Agreement, and (ii) deferred consideration of up to $500 million, plus the assumption of certain liabilities.  Cash proceeds from the sale, before taxes and after customary adjustments as set forth in the Purchase Agreement, were $4.2 billion.This transaction carries inherent risks, including the risk that Aon will not earn the $500 million of additional consideration or otherwise realize the intended value of the transaction, as well as risks connected with separating the Divested Business from Aon. Because the Divested Business represented 19% of our gross revenues for the fiscal year 2016, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected, or may not be accretive to adjusted earnings per share as anticipated, if we fail to effectively reduce our overhead costs to reflect the reduced scale of operations or fail to grow our other business as expected. Additionally, the separation of the Divested Businesses from the rest of Aon’s business requires significant resources, which may disrupt operations or divert management’s attention from Aon’s day-today operations and efforts to grow our other businesses.  We are party to a transition services agreement with the Buyer under which we provide certain services to the Buyer and the Buyer provides certain systems or services to us.  There are risks associated with this transition services agreement, particularly as we transition off of the Buyer’s systems and services and initiate our own new systems and processes, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.Furthermore, we have entered into ongoing commercial arrangements with the Buyer.  If we do not realize the intended benefits of these arrangements, it could affect our results of operations or adversely affect our relationship with clients, partners, colleagues and other third parties.  Additionally, if the Divested Business does not deliver the level of service to which our clients and partners are accustomed, it could adversely affect our relationships with such third parties.21Our results may be adversely affected by changes in the mode of compensation in the insurance industry.In the past, the Attorney General of the State of New York brought charges against members of the insurance brokerage community. These actions have created uncertainty concerning longstanding methods of compensating insurance brokers. Given that the insurance brokerage industry has faced scrutiny from regulators in the past over its compensation practices, it is possible that regulators may choose to revisit the same or other practices in the future. If they do so, compliance with new regulations along with any sanctions that might be imposed for past practices deemed improper could have an adverse impact on our future results of operations and inflict significant reputational harm on our business.Risks Related to Our Ordinary SharesTransfers of the Class A Ordinary Shares may be subject to stamp duty or SDRT in the U.K., which would increase the cost of dealing in the Class A Ordinary Shares.Stamp duty reserve taxes (“SDRT”) are imposed in the U.K. on certain transfers of chargeable securities (which include shares in companies incorporated in the U.K.) at a rate of 0.5 percent of the consideration paid for the transfer. Certain transfers of shares to depositaries or into clearance systems are charged at a higher rate of 1.5 percent.Our Class A Ordinary Shares are eligible to be held in book entry form through the facilities of Depository Trust Company (“DTC”). Transfers of shares held in book entry form through DTC will not attract a charge to stamp duty or SDRT in the U.K. A transfer of the shares from within the DTC system out of DTC and any subsequent transfers that occur entirely outside the DTC system will attract a charge to stamp duty at a rate of 0.5 percent of any consideration, which is payable by the transferee of the shares. Any such duty must be paid (and the relevant transfer document stamped by Her Majesty’s Revenues and Customs (“HMRC”)) before the transfer can be registered in the books of Aon. If those shares are redeposited into DTC, the redeposit will attract stamp duty or SDRT at a rate of 1.5 percent of the value of the shares.We have put in place arrangements to require that shares held in certificated form cannot be transferred into the DTC system until the transferor of the shares has first delivered the shares to a depository specified by us so that SDRT may be collected in connection with the initial delivery to the depository. Any such shares will be evidenced by a receipt issued by the depository. Before the transfer can be registered in our books, the transferor will also be required to put in the depository funds to settle the resultant liability to SDRT, which will be charged at a rate of 1.5 percent of the value of the shares.Following the decision of the First Tier Tribunal (Tax Chamber) in HSBC Holdings plc, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation v HMRC 2012 UKFTT 163 (TC) and the announcement by HMRC that it will not seek to appeal the decision, HMRC is no longer enforcing the charge to SDRT on the issue of shares into either EU or non-EU depository receipt or clearance systems.If the Class A Ordinary Shares are not eligible for continued deposit and clearing within the facilities of DTC, then transactions in our securities may be disrupted.The facilities of DTC are a widely-used mechanism that allow for rapid electronic transfers of securities between the participants in the DTC system, which include many large banks and brokerage firms. We believe that prior to the Redomestication, approximately 99% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Aon Corporation were held within the DTC system. The Class A Ordinary Shares of Aon plc are, at present, eligible for deposit and clearing within the DTC system. In connection with the closing of the Redomestication, we entered into arrangements with DTC whereby we agreed to indemnify DTC for any stamp duty and/or SDRT that may be assessed upon it as a result of its service as a depository and clearing agency for our Class A Ordinary Shares. In addition, we have obtained a ruling from HMRC in respect of the stamp duty and SDRT consequences of the reorganization, and SDRT has been paid in accordance with the terms of this ruling in respect of the deposit of Class A Ordinary Shares with the initial depository. DTC will generally have discretion to cease to act as a depository and clearing agency for the Class A Ordinary Shares. If DTC determines at any time that the Class A Ordinary Shares are not eligible for continued deposit and clearance within its facilities, then we believe the Class A Ordinary Shares would not be eligible for continued listing on a U.S. securities exchange or inclusion in the S&P 500 and trading in the Class A Ordinary Shares would be disrupted. While we would pursue alternative arrangements to preserve our listing and maintain trading, any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of the Class A Ordinary Shares"
8,AON,AON PLC,2017-02-23,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
The risk factors set forth below reflect material risks associated with existing and potential lines of business and contain “forward-looking statements” as discussed in the “Business” Section of Part I, Item 1 of this report. Readers should consider them in addition to the other information contained in this report as our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected if any of these risks were to actually occur.The following are material risks related to our businesses specifically and the industries in which we operate generally that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements in this document and elsewhere. Risks Relating to the Company GenerallyCompetitive RisksAn overall decline in economic activity could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of our businesses.The demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases, affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our Risk Solutions business. The economic activity that impacts property and casualty insurance is most closely correlated with employment levels, corporate revenue and asset values. Downward fluctuations in the year-over-year insurance premium charged by insurers to protect against the same risk, referred to in the industry as softening of the insurance market, could adversely affect our Risk Solutions business as a significant portion of the earnings are determined as a percentage of premium charged to our clients. Insolvencies and consolidations associated with an economic downturn, especially insolvencies in the insurance industry, could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business.  Also, error and omission claims against us, which we refer to as E&O claims, may increase in economic downturns, also adversely affecting our brokerage business.The results of our HR Solutions business are generally affected by the level of business activity of our clients, which in turn is affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets these clients serve. Economic downturns in some markets may cause reductions in technology and discretionary spending by our clients, which may result in reductions in the growth of new business or reductions in existing business. If our clients become financially less stable, enter bankruptcy, liquidate their operations or consolidate, our revenues and collectability of receivables could be adversely affected. In addition, our revenues from many of our outsourcing contracts depend upon the number of our clients’ employees or the number of participants in our clients’ employee benefit plans and could be adversely affected by layoffs. We may also experience decreased demand for our services as a result of postponed or terminated outsourcing of human resources functions. Reduced demand for our services could increase price competition. We face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses.We believe that competition in our Risk Solutions segment is based on service, product features, price, commission structure, financial strength, ability to access certain insurance markets and name recognition. In this regard, we compete with a large number of global, national, regional and local insurance companies and other financial services providers and brokers.Our HR Solutions segment competes with a large number of independent firms and consulting organizations affiliated with accounting, information systems, technology and financial services firms around the world. Many of our competitors in this area are expanding the services they offer or reducing prices in an attempt to gain additional business. Additionally, some competitors have established, and are likely to continue to establish, cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address client needs.Our competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources, larger customer bases, greater name recognition, stronger presence in certain geographies and more established relationships with their customers and suppliers than 9we have. In addition, new competitors, alliances among competitors or mergers of competitors could emerge and gain significant market share, and some of our competitors may have or may develop a lower cost structure, adopt more aggressive pricing policies or provide services that gain greater market acceptance than the services that we offer or develop. Competitors may be able to respond to the need for technological changes and innovate faster, or price their services more aggressively. They may also compete for skilled professionals, finance acquisitions, fund internal growth and compete for market share more effectively than we do. To respond to increased competition and pricing pressure, we may have to lower the cost of our services or decrease the level of service provided to clients, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Financial RisksWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows.We face exposure to adverse movements in exchange rates of currencies other than our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, as a significant portion of our business is located outside of the United States. These exposures may change over time, and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. Our five largest non-U.S. dollar exposures are the British pound, Euro, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and Indian rupee; however, we also have exposures to other currencies that can have significant currency volatility.  These currency exchange fluctuations create risk in both the translation of the financial results of our global subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for our consolidated financial statements, as well as in those of our operations that receive revenue and incur expenses other than in their respective local currencies, which can reduce the profitability of our operations based on the direction the respective currencies’ exchange rates move.  A decrease in the value of certain currencies relative to other currencies could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that benefit to a greater degree from a specific exchange rate move and can, as a result, deliver services at a lower cost or receive greater revenues from such a transaction. Although we use various derivative financial instruments to help protect against adverse foreign exchange rate fluctuations, we cannot eliminate such risks, and, as a result, changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results.  For example, the strengthening of the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies might adversely affect the value of our products and services when translated to U.S. dollar, even if the value of such products and services has not changed in their original currency.Changes in interest rates and deterioration of credit quality could reduce the value of our cash balances and investment portfolios and adversely affect our financial condition or results.Operating funds available for corporate use were $721 million at December 31, 2016 and are reported in Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments. Funds held on behalf of clients and insurers were $3.8 billion at December 31, 2016 and are reported in Fiduciary assets. We also carry an investment portfolio of other long-term investments. As of December 31, 2016, these long-term investments had a carrying value of $119 million.  Adverse changes in interest rates, performance, and counterparty credit quality, including default, could reduce the value of these funds and investments, thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results. We may continue to experience reduced investment earnings on our cash and short-term investments of fiduciary and operating funds if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain at or near their current low levels, or if negative yields on deposits or investments, as we have experienced in Japan and certain jurisdictions in the European Union, continue or arise in the jurisdictions in which we operate. On the other hand, higher interest rates could result in a higher discount rate used by investors to value our future cash flows thereby resulting in a lower valuation of the Company. In addition, during times of stress in the banking industry, counterparty risk can quickly escalate, potentially resulting in substantial losses for us as a result of our cash or other investments with such counterparties, as well as substantial losses for our clients and the insurance companies with which we work.Our pension obligations could adversely affect our shareholders’ equity, net income, cash flow and liquidity.To the extent that the pension obligations associated with our pension plans continue to exceed the fair value of the assets supporting those obligations, our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected. In particular, lower interest rates and investment returns could result in the present value of plan liabilities increasing at a greater rate than the value of plan assets, resulting in higher unfunded positions in our pension plans.  In addition, the periodic revision of pension assumptions or variances of actual results from our assumptions can materially change the present value of expected future benefits, and therefore the funded status of the plans and resulting net periodic pension expense. As a result, we may experience future changes in the funded status of our plans that could require us to make additional cash contributions beyond those that have been estimated and which could adversely affect shareholders’ equity, net income, cash flow and liquidity.   Our worldwide pension plans are significant, therefore our pension contributions and expense are sensitive to various market and demographic factors. These factors include equity and bond market returns, the assumed interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities, foreign exchange rates, rates of inflation, mortality assumptions, potential regulatory and legal changes and counterparty exposure from various investments and derivative contracts, including annuities. Variations in any of these factors could cause significant changes to our financial position and results of operations from year to year.10We have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility.As of December 31, 2016, we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately $6.2 billion. The level of debt outstanding could adversely affect our financial flexibility by reducing our ability to use cash from operations for other purposes, including working capital, dividends to shareholders, share repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. We also are subject to risks that, at the time any of our outstanding debt matures, we will not be able to retire or refinance the debt on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.As of December 31, 2016, we had two committed credit facilities outstanding. Each of these facilities is intended to support our commercial paper obligations and our general working capital needs. In addition, each of these facilities included customary representations, warranties and covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios of adjusted consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense and consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated EBITDA, tested quarterly.  A substantial portion of our outstanding debt, including certain intercompany debt obligations, contains financial and other covenants. The terms of these covenants may limit our ability to obtain, or increase the costs of obtaining, additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate requirements. This in turn may have the impact of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, thereby placing us at a relative disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness, or fewer or less onerous covenants associated with such indebtedness, and making us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions.If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business. Additionally, we may not be able to effect such actions or refinance any of our debt, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.A decline in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper may adversely affect our borrowing costs, access to capital, and financial flexibility.A downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper could increase our borrowing costs, reduce or eliminate our access to capital, reduce our financial flexibility, and limit our ability to implement on corporate strategy. Our senior debt ratings at December 31, 2016 were A- with a stable outlook (Standard & Poor’s), BBB+ with a stable outlook (Fitch, Inc), and Baa2 with a stable outlook (Moody’s Investor Services). Our commercial paper ratings were A-2 (S&P), F-2 (Fitch) and P-2 (Moody’s).Real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect any trading market for, or trading value of, our securities.  Such changes could result from any number of factors, including the modification by a credit rating agency of the criteria or methodology it applies to particular issuers, a change in the agency’s view of us or our industry, or as a consequence of actions we take to implement our corporate strategies.  A change in our credit rating could adversely limit our access to capital and our competitive position.The economic and political conditions of the countries and regions in which we operate could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects for growth.Our operations in countries undergoing political change or experiencing economic instability are subject to uncertainty and risks that could materially adversely affect our business.  These risks include, particularly in emerging markets, the possibility we would be subject to undeveloped or evolving legal systems, unstable governments and economies, and potential governmental actions affecting the flow of goods, services and currency.Furthermore, seemingly nationally or regionally localized political and economic changes could have a wider, negative impact on our businesses that expands beyond our operations in the immediately affected jurisdiction. The United Kingdom’s anticipated formal initiation of a withdrawal process from the European Union has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and has given rise to calls for the governments of other European Union member states to consider withdrawal.  These developments have created uncertainty and may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets.  Lack of clarity about future United Kingdom laws and regulations, including financial laws and regulations, tax and free trade agreements, immigration laws and employment laws, could also depress economic activity and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the continued concerns regarding the ability of certain European countries to service their outstanding debt has led to questions regarding the future viability of the Euro as the common currency for the area as various scenarios could result in some countries choosing to return to their former local currencies in an effort to regain control over their domestic economies and monetary policies. This uncertainty has had a dampening effect on growth potential in Europe, and if it deteriorates, may have a material negative impact on our European business as well as that of our clients. Further, any development that has the effect of devaluing or replacing the Euro could meaningfully reduce the value of our assets or profitability denominated in that currency, 11potentially result in charges to our statement of operations and reduce the usefulness of liquidity alternatives denominated in that currency such as our multicurrency U.S. credit facility. We also deposit some of our cash, including cash held in a fiduciary capacity, with certain European financial institutions. While we continuously monitor and manage exposures associated with those deposits, to the extent the uncertainty surrounding economic stability in Europe and the future viability of the Euro suddenly and adversely impacts those financial institutions, some or all of those cash deposits could be at risk.The benefits of our Redomestication may not be realized or may be offset in whole or in part by factors that we do not control.In 2012, we reincorporated in the U.K. and moved our corporate headquarters to London. As a result of this reorganization of our corporate structure, Aon plc became the publicly-held parent company of the Aon group.  There can be no assurance that all of the goals of our Redomestication will be achievable, particularly as the achievement of the benefits are, in many important respects, subject to factors that we do not control. These factors would include such things as the reactions of third parties with whom we enter into contracts and do business and the reactions of investors, analysts, and U.K. and U.S. taxing and other authorities.Our effective tax rates and the benefits from our Redomestication are also subject to a variety of other factors, many of which are beyond our ability to control, such as changes in the rate of economic growth in the U.K., the U.S. and other countries, the financial performance of our business in various jurisdictions, currency exchange rate fluctuations (especially as between the British pound and the U.S. dollar), and significant changes in trade, monetary or fiscal policies of the U.K. or the U.S., including changes in interest rates. The impact of these factors, individually and in the aggregate, is difficult to predict, in part because the occurrence of the events or circumstances may be interrelated and the impact to us of the occurrence of any one of these events or circumstances could be compounded or, alternatively, reduced, offset, or more than offset, by the occurrence of one or more of the other events or circumstances described in such factors.On September 4, 2013, we received from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) an executed Closing Agreement pursuant to which the Company and the IRS agreed that the merger (pursuant to which the Redomestication occurred) did not cause Aon plc to be treated as a U.S. domestic corporation for federal tax purposes. This agreement substantially reduced the risk that actions taken to date might cause Aon plc to be treated as a U.S. domestic corporation for federal tax purposes under the current tax statute and regulations. However, the United States Congress, the IRS, the United Kingdom Parliament or U.K. tax authorities may enact new statutory or regulatory provisions that could adversely affect our status as a non-U.S. corporation, or otherwise adversely affect our anticipated global tax position. Retroactive statutory or regulatory actions have occurred in the past, and there can be no assurance that any such provisions, if enacted or promulgated, would not have retroactive application to us, the Redomestication or any subsequent actions. Our net income and cash flow would be reduced if we were to be subject to U.S. corporate income tax as a domestic corporation. In addition, any future amendments to the current income tax treaties between the U.K and other jurisdictions (including the U.S.), or any new statutory or regulatory provisions that might limit our ability to take advantage of any such treaties, could subject us to increased taxation.Our global effective tax rate is subject to a variety of different factors, which could create volatility in that tax rate, expose us to greater than anticipated tax liabilities or cause us to adjust previously recognized tax assets and liabilities.We are subject to income taxes in the U.K., U.S. and many other jurisdictions. As a result, our global effective tax rate from period to period can be affected by many factors, including changes in tax legislation, our global mix of earnings, including the use of global funding structures, the tax characteristics of our income, the transfer pricing of revenues and costs, acquisitions and dispositions, and the portion of the income of non-U.S. subsidiaries that we expect to remit to the U.S. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes, and our determination of our tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities.We believe that our Redomestication and related transactions should support our ability to maintain a competitive global tax rate because the U.K. has implemented a dividend exemption system that generally does not subject non-U.K. earnings to U.K. tax when such earnings are repatriated to the U.K. in the form of dividends from non-U.K. subsidiaries. This should allow us to optimize our capital allocation through global funding structures. However, we cannot provide any assurances as to what our tax rate will be in any period because of, among other things, uncertainty regarding the nature and extent of our business activities in any particular jurisdiction in the future and the tax laws of such jurisdictions, as well as changes in U.S. and other tax laws, treaties and regulations. Our actual global tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material. Additionally, the tax laws of the U.K., the U.S. and other jurisdictions could change in the future, and such changes could cause a material change in our tax rate.We also could be subject to future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities, and the resolution of such audits could impact our tax rate in future periods, as would any reclassification or other changes (such as those in applicable accounting rules) that increases the amounts we have provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that we would be successful in attempting to mitigate the adverse impacts resulting from any changes in law, audits and 12other matters. Our inability to mitigate the negative consequences of any changes in the law, audits and other matters could cause our global tax rate to increase, our use of cash to increase and our financial condition and results of operations to suffer.Changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S GAAP”). These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. We are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, those relating to restructuring, pensions, recoverability of assets including customer receivables, contingencies, share-based payments, income taxes and estimates and assumptions used for our long term outsourcing contracts. We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances. These assumptions and estimates involve the exercise of judgment and discretion, which may evolve over time in light of operational experience, regulatory direction, developments in accounting principles and other factors. Actual results could differ from these estimates, or changes in assumptions, estimates or policies or the developments in the business or the application of accounting principles related to long-term contracts may change our initial estimates of future contract results, which could materially affect the Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Financial Position, Shareholders’ Equity and Cash Flows. We may be required to record goodwill or other long-lived asset impairment charges, which could result in a significant charge to earnings.Under U.S. GAAP, we review our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our share price or market capitalization, reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry. We may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets. Future goodwill or other long-lived asset impairment charges could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.We are a holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends or other payments in needed amounts from our subsidiaries.Our principal assets are the shares of capital stock and indebtedness of our subsidiaries.  We rely on dividends, interest and other payments from these subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligation, paying dividends to shareholders, repurchasing ordinary shares and corporate expenses.  Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate or other restrictions that may limit the amounts that these subsidiaries can pay in dividends or other payments to us. No assurance can be given that there will not be further changes in law, regulatory actions or other circumstances that could restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise make payment to us. In addition, due to differences in tax rates, repatriation of funds from certain countries into the U.K. through the U.S. could have unfavorable tax ramifications for us.  Furthermore, no assurance can be given that our subsidiaries may be able to make timely payments to us in order for us to meet our obligations.Legal and Regulatory RisksWe are subject to E&O claims against us as well as other contingencies and legal proceedings, some of which, if determined unfavorably to us, could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of a business line or the Company as a whole.We assist our clients with various matters, including placing insurance and reinsurance coverage and handling related claims, consulting on various human resources matters, providing actuarial services, investment consulting and asset management services, and outsourcing various human resources functions. E&O claims against us may allege our potential liability for damages arising from these services. E&O claims could include, for example, the failure of our employees or sub-agents, whether negligently or intentionally, to place coverage correctly or notify carriers of claims on behalf of clients or to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured, the failure to give error-free advice in our consulting business or the failure to correctly execute transactions in the human resources outsourcing and benefits administration businesses. It is not always possible to prevent and detect errors and omissions, and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases. In addition, we are subject to other types of claims, litigation and proceedings in the ordinary course of business, which along with E&O claims, may seek damages, including punitive damages, in amounts that could, if awarded, have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, earnings, and cash flows. In addition to potential liability for monetary damages, such claims or outcomes could harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business.13We have historically purchased, and intend to continue to purchase, insurance to cover E&O claims and other insurance to provide protection against certain losses that arise in such matters. However, we have exhausted or materially depleted our coverage under some of the policies that protect us for certain years and, consequently, are self-insured or materially self-insured for some historical claims. Accruals for these exposures, and related insurance receivables, when applicable, have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable. These accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as developments warrant, and may also be adversely affected by disputes we may have with our insurers over coverage. Amounts related to settlement provisions are recorded in Other general expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Discussion of some of these claims, lawsuits, and proceedings are contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.In addition, we provide a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to our customers and others. The maximum potential amount of future payments represents the notional amounts that could become payable under the guarantees and indemnifications if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties, without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or other methods. Any anticipated payment amounts under guarantees and indemnifications that are deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable are included in our consolidated financial statements. These amounts may not represent actual future payments, if any, for these guarantees and indemnifications.The ultimate outcome of these claims, lawsuits, proceedings, guarantees and indemnifications cannot be ascertained, and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us. It is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters.Our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which could reduce our profitability, limit our growth, or increase competition.Our businesses are subject to extensive legal and regulatory oversight throughout the world, including the U.K. Companies Act and the rules and regulations promulgated by the Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), the U.S. securities laws, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, and a variety of other laws, rules and regulations addressing, among other things, licensing, data privacy and protection, wage-and-hour standards, employment and labor relations, anti-competition, anti-corruption, currency, reserves, government contracting and the amount of local investment with respect to our operations in certain countries.  This legal and regulatory oversight could reduce our profitability or limit our growth by increasing the costs of legal and regulatory compliance; by limiting or restricting the products or services we sell, the markets we enter, the methods by which we sell our products and services, or the prices we can charge for our services, and the form of compensation we can accept from our clients, carriers and third parties; or by subjecting our businesses to the possibility of legal and regulatory actions or proceedings.The global nature of our operations increases the complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations, including training and employee expenses, adding to our cost of doing business.  In addition, many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions, increasing further the complexity and cost of compliance.  In emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less developed legal systems, local laws and regulations may not be established with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us adequate assurance that we are operating our business in a compliant manner with all required licenses or that our rights are otherwise protected. In addition, certain laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance provisions of the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act (“FATCA”) in the U.S. and the Bribery Act of 2010 (“U.K. Bribery Act”) in the U.K., impact our operations outside of the legislating country by imposing requirements for the conduct of overseas operations, and in a number of cases, requiring compliance by foreign subsidiaries. For example, FATCA has resulted in, and will likely continue to result in, increased compliance costs. FATCA requires certain of our subsidiaries, affiliates and other entities to obtain valid FATCA documentation from payees prior to remitting certain payments to such payees.  In the event we do not obtain valid FATCA documents, we may be obliged to withhold a portion of such payments.  This obligation is shared with our customers and clients who may fail to comply, in whole or in part. In such circumstances, we may incur FATCA compliance costs including withholding taxes, interest and penalties. In addition, regulatory initiatives and changes in the regulations and guidance promulgated under FATCA may increase our costs of operations, and could adversely affect the market for our services as intermediaries, which could adversely affect our operations, results of operations and financial condition.In addition to the complexity of the laws and regulations themselves, the development of new laws and regulations, changes in application or interpretation of laws and regulations and our continued operational changes and development into new jurisdictions and new service offerings also increases our legal and regulatory compliance complexity as well as the type of governmental oversight to which we may be subject.  These changes in laws and regulations could mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional licensure requirements or costs to our operations and services. Furthermore, as we enter new jurisdictions or lines of businesses and other developments in our services, 14we may become subject to additional types of laws and policies and governmental oversight and supervision such as those applicable to the financial lending or other service institutions. In all jurisdictions, the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities. Generally, such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations. Accordingly, we may have a license revoked or be unable to obtain new licenses and therefore be precluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on or developing some or all of our activities or otherwise fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction. No assurances can be given that our business can further develop or continue to be conducted in any given jurisdiction as it has been conducted in the past.In addition, new regulatory or industry developments could create an increase in competition that could adversely affect us. These developments include:•the selling of insurance by insurance companies directly to insureds;•changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory actions or changes;•the establishment of programs in which state-sponsored entities provide property insurance in catastrophe prone areas or other alternative types of coverage;•changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans, defined contribution and defined benefit plans, and investment consulting and asset management;•additional regulations promulgated by the FCA in the U.K., or other regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which we operate; or•additional requirements respecting data privacy and data usage in jurisdictions in which we operate that may increase our costs of compliance and potentially reduce the manner in which data can be used by us to develop or further our product offerings.Changes in the regulatory scheme, or even changes in how existing regulations are interpreted, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations by limiting revenue streams or increasing costs of compliance. Likewise, increased government involvement in the insurance or reinsurance markets could curtail or replace our opportunities and negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.With respect to our Risk Solutions segment, our business’ regulatory oversight generally also includes licensing of insurance brokers and agents, managing general agency or general underwriting operations and third-party administrators, and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Our continuing ability to provide insurance broking and third-party administration in the jurisdictions in which we operate depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions. Also, we can be affected indirectly by the governmental regulation and supervision of insurance companies. For instance, if we are providing or managing general underwriting services for an insurer, we may have to contend with regulations affecting our client.Services provided in our HR Solutions segment are also the subject of ever-evolving government regulation, either because the services provided to our clients are regulated directly or because third parties upon whom we rely to provide services to clients are regulated, thereby indirectly impacting the manner in which we provide services to those clients.  In particular, our health care exchange business depends upon the private sector of the U.S. insurance system and its role in financing health care delivery, and insurance carriers’ use of, and payment of, commissions to, agents, brokers and other organizations to market and sell individual and family health insurance products and plans. Uncertainty regarding, or any changes to, state or federal law, or the interpretation of such law by applicable regulatory agencies, including the effects of health care reform by the U.S. government, could delay client adoption of our healthcare exchanges, impair our ability to retain clients who have adopted our healthcare exchanges, or cause insurance carriers to alter or eliminate the products and plans that they offer or attempt to move members into new products or plans for which we receive lower commissions.  In addition, more generally within our HR Solutions segment, changes in laws, government regulations or the way those regulations are interpreted in the jurisdictions in which we operate could affect the viability, value, use or delivery of benefits and human resources programs, including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans (such as medical), defined contribution plans (such as 401(k)), defined benefit plans (such as pension) or payroll delivery, may adversely affect the demand for, or profitability of, our services.If we violate the laws and regulation to which we are subject, we could be subject to fines, penalties or criminal sanctions and could be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries.  There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate these laws and regulations, causing an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. In addition, our businesses and operations are subject to heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. As regulators and other government agencies continue to examine our operations, there is no assurance that consent orders or other enforcement actions will not be issued by them in the future. These and other initiatives from national, state and local officials may subject us to judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or 15cause us to be required to restructure its operations and activities, all of which could lead to reputational issues, or higher operational costs, thereby adversely affecting our business, financial condition or operating results.Failure to protect our intellectual property rights, or allegations that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others, could harm our reputation, ability to compete effectively and financial condition.To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on a combination of trademark laws, copyright laws, patent laws, trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements with our affiliates, employees, clients, strategic partners and others. However, the protective steps that we take may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights.  Further, effective trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer our services or competitors may develop products similar to our products that do not conflict with our related intellectual property rights. Failure to protect our intellectual property adequately could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively. In addition, to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, we may initiate litigation against third parties, such as infringement suits or interference proceedings.  Third parties may assert intellectual property rights claims against us, which may be costly to defend, could require the payment of damages and could limit our ability to use or offer certain technologies, products or other intellectual property. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be expensive, take significant time and divert management’s attention from other business concerns. Successful challenges against us could require us to modify or discontinue our use of technology or business processes where such use is found to infringe or violate the rights of others, or require us to purchase licenses from third parties, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.We have less flexibility as a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales with respect to certain aspects of capital management.English law imposes some restrictions on certain corporate actions by which previously, as a Delaware corporation, we were not constrained. For example, English law provides that a board of directors may only allot, or issue, securities with the prior authorization of shareholders, such authorization being up to the aggregate nominal amount of shares and for a maximum period of five years, each as specified in the articles of association or relevant shareholder resolution. The current authorization is effective until the earlier of our next annual general meeting or August 31, 2017.  This authorization will need to be renewed by our shareholders periodically and we intend to renew this authorization at each annual general meeting.  English law also generally provides shareholders with preemptive rights when new shares are issued for cash; however, it is possible for the articles of association, or shareholders in general meeting, to exclude preemptive rights. Such an exclusion of preemptive rights may be for a maximum period of up to five years as specified in the articles of association or relevant shareholder resolution. The current exclusion is effective until the earlier of our next annual general meeting or August 31, 2017.  This exclusion would need to be renewed by our shareholders periodically and we intend to renew this exclusion at each annual general meeting.  English law also requires us to have available “distributable reserves” to make share repurchases or pay dividends to shareholders.  Distributable reserves may be created through the earnings of the U.K. parent company.  As of December 31, 2016, we had distributable reserves in excess of $1.6 billion.  While it is our intention to maintain a sufficient level of distributable reserves in order to pay dividends on our ordinary shares and make share repurchases in accordance with our share repurchase program, there is no assurance that the parent company level will continue to generate sufficient earnings in order to maintain the necessary level of distributable reserves to do so.English law also generally prohibits a company from repurchasing its own shares by way of “off market purchases” without the prior approval of our shareholders. Such approval lasts for a maximum period of up to five years. Our shares are traded on the NYSE, which is not a recognized investment exchange in the U.K. Consequently, any repurchase of our shares is currently considered an “off market purchase.”  The current authorization expires on June 17, 2020.  Renewal of this authorization will be sought periodically.The enforcement of civil liabilities against us may be more difficult.Because we are a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, investors could experience more difficulty enforcing judgments obtained against us in U.S. courts than would have been the case for U.S. judgments obtained against Aon Corporation. In addition, it may be more difficult (or impossible) to bring some types of claims against us in courts in England than it would be to bring similar claims against a U.S. company in a U.S. court.16We are a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Therefore, it may not be possible to effect service of process upon us within the United States in order to enforce judgments of U.S. courts against us based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws.There is doubt as to the enforceability in England and Wales, in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts, of civil liabilities solely based on the U.S. federal securities laws. The English courts will, however, treat any amount payable by us under U.S. judgment as a debt and new proceedings can be commenced in the English courts to enforce this debt against us. The following criteria must be satisfied in order for the English court to enforce the debt created by the U.S. judgment:•the U.S. judgment must be for a debt or definite sum of money;•the U.S. judgment must be final and conclusive;•the U.S. court must, in the circumstances of the case, have had jurisdiction according to the English rules of private international law;•the U.S. judgment must not have been obtained by fraud;•the enforcement of the U.S. judgment must not be contrary to U.K. public policy; and•the proceedings in which the U.S. judgment was obtained must not have been conducted contrary to the rules of natural justice.Operational and Commercial RisksOur success depends on our ability to retain and attract experienced and qualified personnel, including our senior management team and other professional personnel.We depend, in material part, upon the members of our senior management team who possess extensive knowledge and a deep understanding of our business and our strategy. The unexpected loss of services of any of our senior management team could have a disruptive effect adversely impacting our ability to manage our business effectively and execute our business strategy. Competition for experienced professional personnel is intense, and we are constantly working to retain and attract these professionals. If we cannot successfully do so, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. While we have plans for key management succession and long-term compensation plans designed to retain our senior employees, if our succession plans do not operate effectively, our business could be adversely affected.Our global operations expose us to various international risks that could adversely affect our business.Our operations are conducted globally. Accordingly, we are subject to legal, economic and market risks associated with operating in, and sourcing from, foreign countries, including:•difficulties in staffing and managing our foreign offices, including due to unexpected wage inflation or job turnover, and the increased travel, infrastructure and legal and compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;•hyperinflation in certain foreign countries;•imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments;•longer payment cycles;•greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection;•insufficient demand for our services in foreign jurisdictions;•our ability to execute effective and efficient cross-border sourcing of services on behalf of our clients;•restrictions on the import and export of technologies; and•trade barriers.The occurrence of natural or man-made disasters could result in declines in business and increases in claims that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We are exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes, climate events or weather patterns, and pandemic health events, as well as man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism, military actions and cyber-terrorism. The continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, and a natural or man-made disaster could trigger an economic downturn in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster. These consequences could, among other things, result in a decline in business and increased claims from those areas. They could also result in reduced underwriting capacity, making it more difficult for our Risk Solutions professionals to place business. Disasters also could disrupt public and private infrastructure, including communications and financial services, which could disrupt our normal business operations.17A natural or man-made disaster also could disrupt the operations of our counterparties or result in increased prices for the products and services they provide to us. In addition, a disaster could adversely affect the value of the assets in our investment portfolio. Finally, a natural or man-made disaster could increase the incidence or severity of E&O claims against us.Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our personnel, offices and technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations. Should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as an earthquake, hurricane, terrorist attack, pandemic, security breaches, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made disaster, our continued success will depend, in part, on the availability of our personnel, our office facilities, and the proper functioning of existing, new or upgraded computer systems, telecommunications and other related systems and operations. In events like these, while our operational size, the multiple locations from which we operate, and our existing back-up systems provide us with some degree of flexibility, we still can experience near-term operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations. We could potentially lose access to key executives, personnel, or client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario. A disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions, or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships or legal liability.We rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business. Any significant system or network disruption due to a breach in the security of our information technology systems could have a negative impact on our reputation, operations, sales and operating results.We rely on the efficient, uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks, some of which are within the company and some of which are outsourced to third parties. All information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including but not limited to cyber-attacks, computer viruses and security breaches. We regularly experience attacks to our systems and networks and have from time to time experienced cybersecurity breaches, such as computer viruses, unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and similar incidents, which to date have not had a material impact on our business.  If we are unable to efficiently and effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access.  In the future, these types of incidents could result in intellectual property or other confidential information being lost or stolen, including client, employee or company data.  In addition, we may not be able to detect breaches in our information technology systems or assess the severity or impact of a breach in a timely manner.We have implemented various measures to manage our risks related to system and network security and disruptions, but a security breach or a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients, adversely impact our operations, sales and operating results and require us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve such issues. Additionally, in order to maintain the level of security, service and reliability that our clients require, we may be required to make significant additional investments in our information technology system.  Improper disclosure of confidential, personal or proprietary data could result in regulatory scrutiny, legal liability or harm our reputation.One of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our employees’ and clients’ confidential and proprietary information and, in the case of our HR Solutions clients, confidential information about our clients’ employees’ compensation, medical information and other personally identifiable information. We maintain policies, procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information. Nonetheless, we cannot eliminate the risk of human error or inadequate safeguards against employee or vendor malfeasance or cyber-attacks that could result in improper access to or disclosure of confidential, personal or proprietary information. Such access or disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws and regulations that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs, loss of revenue and loss of clients. The release of confidential information as a result of a security breach could also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals or business partners, or by regulators, and the outcome of such proceedings, which could include penalties or fines, could have a significant negative impact on our business.In many jurisdictions, including in the European Union and the U.S., we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of this information.  These laws and regulations are frequently changing and are becoming increasingly complex and sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services both in terms of substance and in terms of enforceability. This makes compliance challenging and expensive. Our failure to adhere 18to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace. Further, regulatory initiatives in the area of data protection are more frequently including provisions allowing authorities to impose substantial fines and penalties, and therefore, failure to comply could also have a significant financial impact.Our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to effectively apply technology in driving value for our clients through technology-based solutions or gain internal efficiencies through the effective application of technology and related tools. Conversely, investments in innovative product offerings may fail to yield sufficient return to cover their investments.Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and implement technology solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology, industry standards and client preferences. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and cost-effective basis, and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace. Additionally, the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses. If we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors or if our competitors develop more cost-effective technologies, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and complete client engagements. For example, we have invested significantly in the development of Inpoint, repositories of global insurance and reinsurance placement information, which we use to drive results for our clients in the insurance and reinsurance placement process. Our competitors are developing competing databases, and their success in this space may impact our ability to differentiate our services to our clients through the use of unique technological solutions. Likewise, we have invested significantly in our HR BPO business and platform. Innovations in software, cloud computing or other technologies that alter how these services are delivered could significantly undermine our investment in this business if we are slow or unable to take advantage of these developments.We are continually developing and investing in innovative and novel service offerings that we believe will address needs that we identify in the markets. Nevertheless, for those efforts to produce meaningful value, we are reliant on a number of other factors, some of which our outside of our control. For example, our HR Solutions segment has invested substantial time and resources in launching health care exchanges under the belief that these exchanges will serve a useful role in helping corporations and individuals in the U.S. manage their growing health care expenses. In order for these exchanges to be successful, health care insurers and corporate and individual participants have to deem them suitable, and whether those parties will find them suitable will be subject to their own particular circumstances.If our clients or third parties are not satisfied with our services, we may face additional cost, loss of profit opportunities, damage to our reputation or legal liability.We depend, to a large extent, on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for high-quality broking, risk management and HR solutions, so that we can understand our clients’ needs and deliver solutions and services that are tailored to satisfy these needs. If a client is not satisfied with our services, it could cause us to incur additional costs and impair profitability. Many of our clients are businesses that band together in industry groups and/or trade associations and actively share information among themselves about the quality of service they receive from their vendors. Accordingly, poor service to one client may negatively impact our relationships with multiple other clients. Moreover, if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, we could be subject to legal liability or loss of client relationships.The nature of much of our work, especially our actuarial services in our HR Solutions business, involves assumptions and estimates concerning future events, the actual outcome of which we cannot know with certainty in advance. Similarly, in our investment consulting business, we may be measured based on our track record regarding judgments and advice on investments that are susceptible to influences unknown at the time the advice was given. In addition, we could make computational, software programming or data entry or management errors. A client may claim it suffered losses due to reliance on our consulting advice, which poses risks of liability exposure and costs of defense and increased insurance premiums.  In addition, claims arising from our professional services may produce publicity that could hurt our reputation and business and adversely affect our ability to secure new business.Damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Our reputation is a key asset of the Company. We advise our clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, financial condition and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters or others could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential clients, which could make it difficult for us to attract new clients and maintain existing ones.  Negative public opinion could also result from actual or alleged conduct by us or those currently or formerly associated with us in any number of activities or circumstances, the use and protection of data and systems, satisfaction of client expectations, and regulatory compliance.  This damage to our reputation could affect 19the confidence of our clients, rating agencies, regulators, stockholders and third parties in transactions that are important to our business adversely effecting on our business, financial condition and operating results.We rely on third parties to perform key functions of our business operations and to provide services to our clients. These third parties may act in ways that could harm our business.   We rely on third parties, and in some cases subcontractors, to provide services, data and information such as technology, information security, funds transfers, data processing, and administration and support functions that are critical to the operations of our business.  These third parties include correspondents, agents and other brokerage and intermediaries, insurance markets, data providers, plan trustees, payroll service providers, software and system vendors, health plan providers, investment managers and providers of human resource functions such as recruiters and trainers, among others.  As we do not fully control the actions of these third parties, we are subject to the risk that their decisions may adversely impact us and replacing these service providers could create significant delay and expense.  A failure by the third parties to comply with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements, in a high quality and timely manner, particularly during periods of our peak demand for their services, could result in economic and reputational harm to us.  In addition, these third parties face their own technology, operating, business and economic risks, and any significant failures by them, including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client, employee, or company information, could cause harm to our reputation.  An interruption in or the cessation of service by any service provider as a result of systems failures, capacity constraints, financial difficulties or for any other reason could disrupt our operations, impact our ability to offer certain products and services, and result in contractual or regulatory penalties, liability claims from clients and/or employees, damage to our reputation and harm to our business. Our business is exposed to risks associated with the handling of client funds.Our Risk Solutions business collects premiums from insureds and remits the premiums to the respective insurers. We also collect claims or refunds from insurers on behalf of insureds, which are then remitted to the insureds. Similarly, part of our HR Solutions’ outsourcing business handles payroll processing and retirement and pension administration for several of our clients. Consequently, at any given time, we may be holding and managing funds of our clients and, in the case of HR Solutions, their employees, while payroll, retirement plan funds or pension payments are being processed. This function creates a risk of loss arising from, among other things, fraud by employees or third parties, execution of unauthorized transactions or errors relating to transaction processing, or other cybersecurity events or security breaches. We are also potentially at risk in the event the financial institution in which we hold these funds suffers any kind of insolvency or liquidity event. The occurrence of any of these types of events in connection with this function could cause us financial loss and reputational harm.In connection with the implementation of our corporate strategies, we face risks associated with the acquisition or disposition of businesses, the entry into new lines of business, the integration of acquired businesses and the growth and development of these businesses.In pursuing our corporate strategy, we may acquire other businesses or dispose of or exit businesses we currently own. The success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate acquisition and disposition targets, negotiate transactions on favorable terms, complete transactions and, in the case of acquisitions, successfully integrate them into our existing businesses. If a proposed transaction is not consummated, the time and resources spent in researching it could adversely result in missed opportunities to locate and acquire other businesses. If acquisitions are made, there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, including, but not limited to, revenue growth, operational efficiencies or expected synergies. If we dispose of or otherwise exit certain businesses, there can be no assurance that we will not incur certain disposition related charges, or that we will be able to reduce overhead related to the divested assets.From time to time, either through acquisitions or internal development, we enter lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. These new lines of business or new products and services present the Company with additional risks, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed.  Such risks include the investment of significant time and resources; the possibility that these efforts will be not be successful; the possibility that marketplace does not accept our products or services, or that we are unable to retain clients that adopt our new products or services; and the risk of additional liabilities associated with these efforts.  In addition, many of the businesses that we acquire and develop will likely have significantly smaller scales of operations prior to the implementation of our growth strategy. If we are not able to manage the growing complexity of these businesses, including improving, refining or revising our systems and operational practices, and enlarging the scale and scope of the businesses, our business may be adversely affected. Other risks include developing knowledge of and experience in the new business, integrating the acquired business into our systems and culture, recruiting professionals and developing and capitalizing on new relationships with experienced market participants. External factors, such as compliance with new or revised regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business.  Failure to manage these risks in the acquisition or development of new businesses could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.20Risks Relating Primarily to Our Risk Solutions SegmentResults in our Risk Solutions segment may fluctuate due to many factors, including cyclical or permanent changes in the insurance and reinsurance markets outside of our control.Results in our Risk Solutions segment have historically been affected by significant fluctuations arising from uncertainties and changes in the industries in which we operate. A significant portion of our revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage. We have no control over premium rates, and our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction. The potential for changes in premium rates is significant, due to pricing cyclicality in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets.In addition to movements in premium rates, our ability to generate premium-based commission revenue may be challenged by:•the growing availability of alternative methods for clients to meet their risk-protection needs, including a greater willingness on the part of corporations to “self-insure,” the use of so-called “captive” insurers, and the development of capital markets-based solutions and other alternative capital sources for traditional insurance and reinsurance needs that increase market capacity, increase competition and put pressure on pricing; •fluctuation in the need for insurance as the economic downturn continues, as clients either go out of business or scale back their operations, and thus reduce the amount of insurance, they procure;•the level of compensation, as a percentage of premium, that insurance carriers are willing to compensate brokers for placement activity;•the growing desire of clients to move away from variable commission rates and instead compensate brokers based upon flat fees, which can negatively impact us as fees are not generally indexed for inflation and do not automatically increase with premium as does commission-based compensation; and•competition from insurers seeking to sell their products directly to consumers, including online sales, without the involvement of an insurance broker.In addition, our increasing focus on new product offerings within the Risk Solutions space exposes us to additional risks. As our business, like the economy as a whole, becomes more technology focused, the speed at which our products are subject to challenge or becoming outdated is consistently increasing.Our results may be adversely affected by changes in the mode of compensation in the insurance industry.In the past, the Attorney General of the State of New York brought charges against members of the insurance brokerage community. These actions have created uncertainty concerning longstanding methods of compensating insurance brokers. Given that the insurance brokerage industry has faced scrutiny from regulators in the past over its compensation practices, it is possible that regulators may choose to revisit the same or other practices in the future. If they do so, compliance with new regulations along with any sanctions that might be imposed for past practices deemed improper could have an adverse impact on our future results of operations and inflict significant reputational harm on our business.Risks Relating Primarily to Our HR Solutions SegmentWe are subject to various risks and uncertainties in connection with the pending sale of our Benefits Administration and HR Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) Platform.On February 9, 2017, Aon entered into a Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Tempo Acquisition, LLC, an affiliate of The Blackstone Group, L.P. (the “Buyer”), to sell our Benefits Administration and HR Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) Platform (the “Divested Business”) in a transaction valued at approximately $4.3 billion plus additional consideration of up to $500 million based on future performance of the Divested Business (the “Transaction”). The completion of the Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among others: (i) the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and (ii) the receipt of all approvals and the filing of all applicable filings under any relevant foreign jurisdictions that are required to be made or obtained as set forth in the Purchase Agreement.  Although the Transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2017, we can make no assurances that the transaction will close in the anticipated timeframe or at all. Any delay or failure to close the Transaction as planned could have a negative impact on Aon’s financial condition and results of operations. To the extent that our current stock price reflects the assumption that the Transaction will be consummated in the timeframe and manner currently anticipated, any delay in the closing of the Transaction or failure to close at all could result in a decline in the market price of our ordinary shares. Aon intends to allocate part of the proceeds from this Transaction to increase its share repurchases, and our Board of Directors has authorized an additional $5 billion under our stock repurchase program in support of this intent. Any delay or failure to close the Transaction as planned could result in the failure of Aon to increase its share repurchases as anticipated. 21Our directors, executive officers, and other employees have expended extensive time and effort and experienced significant distractions from their day-to-day work during the pendency of the Transaction, including not pursuing other opportunities that might have otherwise been beneficial to us.  Additionally, we will have incurred significant third-party transaction costs in connection with the Transaction.  If the Transaction is not consummated, we will have experienced such distractions and incurred such costs without realizing the expected benefit of the Transaction, which may have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations. Even if the Transaction is consummated as expected, it carries inherent risks, including the risk that Aon will not earn the $500 million of additional consideration or otherwise realize the intended value of the Transaction, as well as risks connected with separating the Divested Business from Aon. Because the Divested Business represent 19% of our gross revenues for the fiscal year 2016, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected, or may not be accretive to adjusted earnings per share as anticipated, if we fail to effectively reduce our overhead costs to reflect the reduced scale of operations or fail to grow our other business as expected.  Additionally, the separation of the Divested Businesses from the rest of Aon’s business will require significant resources, which may disrupt operations or divert management’s attention from Aon’s day-to-day operations and efforts to grow our other businesses. Furthermore, if we do not realize the benefits of the Transaction as anticipated or if the Divested Business does not deliver the level of service to which our clients and partners are accustomed, it could adversely affect our relationship with clients, partners, colleagues and other third parties.The profitability of our outsourcing and consulting engagements with clients may not meet our expectations due to unexpected costs, cost overruns, early contract terminations, unrealized assumptions used in our contract bidding process or the inability to maintain our prices.In our HR Solutions segment, our profitability is highly dependent upon our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency. As we adapt to change in our business, adapt to the regulatory environment, enter into new engagements, acquire additional businesses and take on new employees in new locations, we may not be able to manage our large, diverse and changing workforce, control our costs or improve our efficiency.Most new outsourcing arrangements undergo an implementation process whereby our systems and processes are customized to match a client’s plans and programs. The cost of this process is estimated by us and often partially funded by our clients. If our actual implementation expense exceeds our estimate or if the ongoing service cost is greater than anticipated, the client contract may be less profitable than expected.Even though outsourcing clients typically sign long-term contracts, some of these contracts may be terminated at any time, with or without cause, by our client upon 90 to 360 days’ written notice. Our outsourcing clients are generally required to pay a termination fee; however, this amount may not be sufficient to offset the costs we incurred in connection with the implementation and system set-up or fully compensate us for the profit we would have received if the contract had not been cancelled. A client may choose to delay or terminate a current or anticipated project as a result of factors unrelated to our work product or progress, such as the business or financial condition of the client or general economic conditions. When any of our engagements are terminated, we may not be able to eliminate associated ongoing costs or redeploy the affected employees in a timely manner to minimize the impact on profitability. Any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these engagements, including delays caused by factors outside our control, could have an adverse effect on our profit margin.Our profit margin, and therefore our profitability, is largely a function of the rates we are able to charge for our services and the staffing costs for our personnel. Accordingly, if we are not able to maintain the rates we charge for our services or appropriately manage the staffing costs of our personnel, we may not be able to sustain our profit margin and our profitability will suffer. The prices we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors, including competitive factors, cost of living adjustment provisions, the extent of ongoing clients’ perception of our ability to add value through our services and general economic conditions. Our profitability in providing HR BPO services is largely based on our ability to drive cost efficiencies during the term of our contracts for such services. If we cannot drive suitable cost efficiencies, our profit margins will suffer. Our cost efficiencies may be impacted by factors such as our ability to transition consultants from completed projects to new assignments, our ability to secure new consulting engagements, our ability to forecast demand for consulting services (and, consequently, appropriately manage the size and location of our workforce), employee attrition, and the need to devote time and resources to training and professional and business development.We might not be able to achieve the cost savings required to sustain and increase our profit margins in our HR Solutions business.We provide our outsourcing services over long terms for variable or fixed fees that generally are less than our clients’ historical costs to provide for themselves the services we contract to deliver. Also, clients’ demand for cost reductions may increase over the term of the agreement. As a result, we bear the risk of increases in the cost of delivering HR outsourcing services to our clients, and our margins associated with particular contracts will depend on our ability to control our costs of performance under those contracts and meet our service commitments cost-effectively. Over time, some of our operating expenses will increase as we invest 22in additional infrastructure and implement new technologies to maintain our competitive position and meet our client service commitments. We must anticipate and respond to the dynamics of our industry and business by using quality systems, process management, improved asset utilization and effective supplier management tools. We must do this while continuing to grow our business so that our fixed costs are spread over an increasing revenue base. If we are not able to achieve this, our ability to sustain and increase profitability may be reduced.In our investment consulting business, we advise or act on behalf of clients regarding their investments. The results of these investments are uncertain and subject to numerous factors, some of which are within our control and some which are not. Clients that experience losses or lower than expected investment returns may leave us for competitors and/or assert claims against us.Our investment consulting business provides advice to clients on: investment strategy, which can include advice on setting investment objectives, asset allocation, and hedging strategies; selection (or removal) of investment managers; the investment in different investment instruments and products; and the selection of other investment service providers such as custodians and transition managers. For some clients, we are responsible for making decisions on these matters and we may implement such decisions in a fiduciary/agency capacity albeit without assuming title or custody over the underlying funds or assets invested. Asset classes may experience poor absolute performance; third parties we recommend or select, such as investment managers, may underperform their benchmarks due to poor market performance, negligence or other reasons, resulting in poor investment returns or losses. These losses may be attributable in whole or in part to failures on our part or to events entirely outside of our control. Regardless of the cause, clients experiencing losses may assert claims against us, and these claims may be for significant amounts. Defending against these claims can involve potentially significant costs, including legal defense costs, as well as cause substantial distraction and diversion of other resources. Furthermore, our ability to limit our potential liability is restricted in certain jurisdictions and in connection with claims involving breaches of fiduciary/agency duties or other alleged errors or omissions. Additionally, clients experiencing losses or lower than expected investment returns may also leave us for our competitors.Risks Related to Our Ordinary SharesTransfers of the Class A Ordinary Shares may be subject to stamp duty or SDRT in the U.K., which would increase the cost of dealing in the Class A Ordinary Shares.Stamp duty reserve taxes (“SDRT”) are imposed in the U.K. on certain transfers of chargeable securities (which include shares in companies incorporated in the U.K.) at a rate of 0.5 percent of the consideration paid for the transfer. Certain transfers of shares to depositaries or into clearance systems are charged at a higher rate of 1.5 percent.Our Class A Ordinary Shares are eligible to be held in book entry form through the facilities of Depository Trust Company (“DTC”). Transfers of shares held in book entry form through DTC will not attract a charge to stamp duty or SDRT in the U.K. A transfer of the shares from within the DTC system out of DTC and any subsequent transfers that occur entirely outside the DTC system will attract a charge to stamp duty at a rate of 0.5 percent of any consideration, which is payable by the transferee of the shares. Any such duty must be paid (and the relevant transfer document stamped by Her Majesty’s Revenues and Customs (“HMRC”)) before the transfer can be registered in the books of Aon. If those shares are redeposited into DTC, the redeposit will attract stamp duty or SDRT at a rate of 1.5 percent of the value of the shares.We have put in place arrangements to require that shares held in certificated form cannot be transferred into the DTC system until the transferor of the shares has first delivered the shares to a depository specified by us so that SDRT may be collected in connection with the initial delivery to the depository. Any such shares will be evidenced by a receipt issued by the depository. Before the transfer can be registered in our books, the transferor will also be required to put in the depository funds to settle the resultant liability to SDRT, which will be charged at a rate of 1.5 percent of the value of the shares.Following the decision of the First Tier Tribunal (Tax Chamber) in HSBC Holdings plc, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation v HMRC 2012 UKFTT 163 (TC) and the announcement by HMRC that it will not seek to appeal the decision, HMRC is no longer enforcing the charge to SDRT on the issue of shares into either EU or non-EU depository receipt or clearance systems. If the Class A Ordinary Shares are not eligible for continued deposit and clearing within the facilities of DTC, then transactions in our securities may be disrupted.The facilities of DTC are a widely-used mechanism that allow for rapid electronic transfers of securities between the participants in the DTC system, which include many large banks and brokerage firms. We believe that prior to the redomestication approximately 99% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Aon Corporation were held within the DTC system. The Class A Ordinary Shares of Aon plc are, at present, eligible for deposit and clearing within the DTC system. In connection with the closing of the Redomestication, we entered into arrangements with DTC whereby we agreed to indemnify DTC for any stamp duty and/or SDRT that may be assessed upon it as a result of its service as a depository and clearing agency for our Class A Ordinary Shares. In addition, we have obtained a ruling from HMRC in respect of the stamp duty and SDRT consequences of the reorganization, and SDRT has been paid in accordance with the terms of this ruling in respect of the deposit of Class A Ordinary Shares with the initial 23depository. DTC will generally have discretion to cease to act as a depository and clearing agency for the Class A Ordinary Shares. If DTC determines at any time that the Class A Ordinary Shares are not eligible for continued deposit and clearance within its facilities, then we believe the Class A Ordinary Shares would not be eligible for continued listing on a U.S. securities exchange or inclusion in the S&P 500 and trading in the Class A Ordinary Shares would be disrupted. While we would pursue alternative arrangements to preserve our listing and maintain trading, any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of the Class A Ordinary Shares"

.          The following are risks related to our business and the insurance industry that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.The risk factors are: Our results may fluctuate due to many factors, including cyclical or permanent changes in the insurance and reinsurance industries.        Ourresults historically have been subject to significant fluctuations arising from uncertainties and changes in the insurance industry. Changes in premium rates affect not only thepotential profitability of our underwriting businesses but also generally affect the commissions and fees payable to our brokerage businesses. In addition, insurance industry developments that cansignificantly affect our financial performance include factors such as: risinglevels of actual costs that are not known by companies at the time they price their productsvolatileand unpredictable developments, including weather-related and other natural and man-made catastrophes, including acts of terrorismchangesin levels of capacity and demand, including reinsurance capacitychangesin reserves resulting from the general claims and legal environments as different types of claims arise and judicial interpretations relating to the scope ofinsurers' liabilities developchangesin business practices and business compensation models. 8 Our results may be adversely affected by changes in the mode of compensation in the insurance industry.          Since the Attorney General of New York brought charges against one of our competitors in October 2004, there has been a great deal of uncertaintyconcerning then-longstanding methods of compensating insurance brokers. Soon after the Attorney General brought those charges, Aon and certain other large insurance brokers announced thatthey would terminate contingent commission arrangements with underwriters. Most insurance brokers, however, currently continue to enter into such arrangements, and regulators have not taken action toend such arrangements throughout the industry. We face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses.          We believe that competition in our lines of business is based on service, product features, price, commission structure, financial strength, claims-paying abilityratings and name recognition. In particular, we compete with a large number of national, regional and local insurance companies and other financial services providers and brokers.         Weencounter strong competition for both clients and professional talent in our insurance brokerage and risk management services operations from other insurance brokerage firms whichalso operate on a nationwide or worldwide basis, from a large number of regional and local firms throughout the world, from insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insuranceproducts without the assistance of brokers or agents and from other businesses, including commercial and investment banks, accounting firms and consultants that provide risk-relatedservices and products. Our consulting operations compete with independent consulting firms and consulting organizations affiliated with accounting, information systems, technology and financialservices firms around the world.         Inaddition, the increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect us. These developments include: anincrease in capital-raising by insurance underwriting companies, which could result in new entrants to our markets and an influx of capital into the industrytheselling of insurance by insurance companies directly to insuredschangesin our business compensation model as a result of regulatory investigationstheestablishment of programs in which state-sponsored entities provide property insurance in catastrophe prone areas or other alternative markets types of coverageadditionalregulations promulgated by the FSA in the U.K., or other regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which we operate.         Newcompetition as a result of these developments could cause the supply of, and demand for, our products and services to change, which could adversely affect our results of operationsand financial condition. We may not realize all of the expected benefits from our restructuring plans.          In third quarter 2007, we announced a global restructuring plan intended to create a more streamlined organization and to reduce future expense growth to betterserve clients (""the 2007 Plan""). As a result, we have adopted restructuring initiatives that are expected to result in the elimination of an estimated 2,700 employee positions, the closing orconsolidation of several offices, asset impairments and other expenses necessary to implement these initiatives. We currently expect that the 2007 Plan will result in cumulative pretax charges of$360 million. We anticipate that our annualized savings from the 2007 Plan will be approximately $240 million by 2010. We cannot assure that we will achieve the targeted savings. In2005, we began a restructuring initiative to reduce our fixed cost base and increase 9 efficiency(""the 2005 Plan""). The 2005 Plan is substantially complete, and resulted in cumulative pretax charges totaling $366 million. Restructuring costs included the elimination ofapproximately 3,600 employee positions, the closing of various offices, asset impairments and other expenses necessary to implement these initiatives. We anticipate that our annualized savings fromthe 2005 Plan will be approximately $270 million by 2008. Estimated savings from the 2007 and 2005 Plans do not include any benefits related to businesses placed in discontinued operations. Wecannot assure that we will achieve the targeted savings. Changes in interest rates and investment prices could reduce the value of our investment portfolio and adversely affect our financial condition or results.          We carry an investment portfolio of fixed-maturity and other long-term investments. As of December 31, 2007, our continuing operations hadfixed-maturity investments (approximately 96% was investment grade) that had a carrying value of $150 million and our other long-term investments had a carrying value of$317 million. Funds held on behalf of clients, which were $3.1 billion at December 31, 2007, are held in short-term investments. Changes in interest rates andinvestment prices could reduce the value of our investment portfolio and adversely affect our financial condition or results.         Forexample, changes in domestic and international interest rates directly affect our income from, and the market value of, fixed-maturity investments. Similarly, general economicconditions, stock market conditions and other factors beyond our control affect the value of our equity investments. We monitor our portfolio for other-than-temporaryimpairments in carrying value. For securities judged to have an other-than-temporary impairment, we recognize a realized loss through the statement of income to write down thevalue of those securities.         Weare also subject to potential declines in credit quality, either related to issues specific to certain industries or to a weakening in the economy in general. The concentration of ourinvestment portfolio in any particular industry, group of related industries or geographic sector could have an adverse effect on our investment portfolio and, consequently, on our results ofoperations and financial condition. A decline in the quality of our investment portfolio as a result of adverse economic conditions or otherwise could cause realized losses on securities, includingrealized losses relating to derivative strategies. The financial and liquidity needs of our business could also cause us to sell assets from our investment portfolio at unfavorable prices. Our net pension liabilities may grow, which could adversely affect our stockholders' equity, net income, cash flow and liquidity and require us to make additional cashcontributions to our pension plans.          To the extent that the present value of the benefits incurred to date for pension obligations in the major countries in which we operate continues to exceed thevalue of the assets supporting these obligations, our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected. In certain previous years, there have been declines in interest rates. Asa result of lower interest rates, the present value of plan liabilities increased faster than the value of plan assets, resulting in significantly higher unfunded positions in several of our majorpension plans.         Cashcontributions of approximately $195 million will be required in 2008 for our major pension plans, although we may elect to contribute more. Total cash contributions to thesepension plans in 2007 were $211 million, which was an increase of $7 million from 2006. In 2006, we also contributed $166 million ofnon-cash financial instruments to certain of our U.K. plans. In total, our 2007 contributions to these pension plans were $159 million less than in 2006. Future estimates are basedon certain assumptions, including discount rates, interest rates, mortality, fair value of assets and expected return on plan assets.         Periodicrevision of pension assumptions can materially change the present value of future benefits, and therefore the funded status of the plans and the resulting periodic pensionexpense. Changes in our pension benefit obligations and the related net periodic costs or credits may occur in the future 10 dueto any variance of actual results from our assumptions and changes in the number of participating employees. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will not experience future decreases instockholders' equity, net income, cash flow and liquidity or that we will not be required to make additional cash contributions in the future beyond those which have been estimated. We are subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedings which, if determined unfavorably to us, would adversely affect our financial results.          We are subject to numerous claims, tax assessments, lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. The damages claimed in these mattersare or may be substantial, including, in many instances, claims for punitive, treble or extraordinary damages. It is possible that, if the outcomes of these contingencies and legal proceedings werenot favorable to us, it could materially adversely affect our future financial results. In addition, our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected if in thefuture our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilities for which we self-insure. Aon has purchased errors and omissions (""E&O"")insurance and other insurance to provide protection against losses that arise in such matters. Accruals for these items, net of insurance receivables, when applicable, have been provided to the extentthat losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable. These accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as developments warrant.         In2004, Aon, other insurance brokers, insurers and numerous other industry participants received subpoenas and other requests for information from the office of the Attorney General ofthe State of New York and from other states relating to certain practices in the insurance industry.         OnMarch 4, 2005, Aon entered into an agreement (the ""Settlement Agreement"") with the Attorney General of the State of New York, the Superintendent of Insurance of the State ofNew York, the Attorney General of the State of Connecticut, the Illinois Attorney General and the Director of the Division of Insurance, Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation(collectively, the ""State Agencies"") to resolve all the issues related to investigations conducted by the State Agencies. The 2005 Settlement Agreement, under which Aon distributed funds to certainclients and implemented business reforms, has been described in detail in Aon's previous financial filings. Aon has also enteredinto a comprehensive settlement agreement, under the auspices of the NAIC, with numerous other states, that also incorporates these same business reforms.         Purportedclients have also filed civil litigation against Aon and other companies under a variety of laws and legal theories relating to broker compensation practices and other issuesunder investigation by New York and other states. As previously reported, a putative class action styled Daniel v. Aon (Affinity) has been pending inthe Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois since August 1999. In March 2005, the Court gave preliminary approval to a nationwide class action settlement under which Aon agreed to pay a total of$38 million to its policyholders. The Court granted final approval to the settlement in March 2006. Parties that objected to the settlement have appealed.         Beginningin June 2004, a number of other putative class actions were filed against Aon and other companies by purported classes of clients under a variety of legal theories, includingstate tort, contract, fiduciary duty, antitrust and statutory theories and federal antitrust and Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (""RICO"") theories. The federal actions wereconsolidated in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, and a state court collective action was filed in California. In the New Jersey actions, the Court dismissed plaintiffs' federalantitrust and RICO claims in separate orders in August and October 2007, respectively. Plaintiffs have appealed these dismissals. Aon believes it has meritorious defenses in all of these cases andintends to vigorously defend itself against these claims. The outcome of these lawsuits, and any losses or other payments that may occur as a result, cannot be predicted at this time. 11         Beginningin late October 2004, several putative securities class actions were filed against Aon in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Also beginning in lateOctober 2004, several putative ERISA class actions were filed against Aon in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Aon believes it has meritorious defenses in all of thesecases and intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims. The outcome of these lawsuits, and any losses or other payments that may occur as a result, cannot be predicted at this time. Withrespect to the various securities and ERISA class actions, we are unable to estimate a range of possible losses, as these actions have not yet progressed to the stages where damages, if any, can beestimated.         Followinginquiries from regulators, the Company commenced an internal review of its compliance with certain U.S. and non-U.S. anti-bribery laws, including theU.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA""). An outside law firm with significant experience in the area is overseeing this review. Certain governmental agencies, including the U.K. Financial ServicesAuthority, the City of London police, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the U.S. Department of Justice are also investigating these matters. Aon is fully cooperating with theseinvestigations, and has agreed with the U.S. agencies to toll any applicable statute of limitations pending completion of the investigations. Based on current information, the Company is unable topredict at this time when these matters will be concluded, or what regulatory or other outcomes may result.         Afinancial institution in the U.K. called Standard Life Assurance Ltd. brought an action in London Commercial Court against Aon seeking more than £50 million ($99 million atDecember 31, 2007 exchange rates) for alleged errors or omissions in the placement of a professional indemnity policy with certain underwriters. In a decision issued on February 13, 2008, thecourt construed the relevant policy language to excuse underwriters from paying Standard Life and concluded that Aon was negligent in not seeking changes to the language. The court granted Aon leaveto file an interlocutory appeal on these issues and stated in granting leave that the issue in the case was a ""difficult question of construction on which views may legitimately differ."" Aon believesthat the decision is incorrect, is appealing this decision and, if the appeal is unsuccessful, will vigorously contest other issues that have not yet been litigated in the Commercial Court. Aonfurther believes that, as a result of an indemnity given to Aon by a third party, Aon may be entitled to indemnification in whole or part should it ultimately suffer a loss in this matter. Because ofthe uncertainty inherent in the appeals process, the ability to contest issues in subsequent proceedings, the potential indemnity, and potential recoveries from Aon's errors and omissions insurance,Aon is unable to predict at this time the probable loss, if any, from this matter.         Althoughthe ultimate outcome of all matters referred to above cannot be ascertained, and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on Aon or its subsidiaries, on the basis ofpresent information, amounts already provided, availability of insurance coverages and legal advice received, it is the opinion of management that the disposition or ultimate determination of suchclaims will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of Aon. However, it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly orannual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters. We are subject to increasing costs arising from E&O claims against us.          In our insurance brokerage and consulting businesses, we often assist our clients with matters which include the placement of insurance coverage or employeebenefit plans and the handling of related claims. E&O claims against us may allege our potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question. E&O claims could include, for example, thefailure of our employees or sub-agents, whether negligently or intentionally, to place coverage correctly or notify carriers of claims on behalf of clients or to provide insurance carrierswith complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured. It is not always possible to prevent and detect errors and omissions, and the precautions 12 wetake may not be effective in all cases. In addition, E&O claims may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel.          Our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain experienced personnel, including underwriters, brokers and other professional personnel.Competition for such experienced professional personnel is intense. If we cannot hire and retain talented personnel, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adverselyaffected. Our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation which could reduce our profitability or limit our growth.          Our businesses are subject to extensive federal, state and foreign governmental regulation and supervision, which could reduce our profitability or limit ourgrowth by increasing the costs of regulatory compliance, limiting or restricting the products or services we sell or the methods by which we sell our products and services or subjecting our businessesto the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings. With respect to our insurance brokerage businesses, this supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents andthird-party administrators and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Our continuing ability to provide insurance brokering and third-partyadministration in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of thesejurisdictions. Also, we can be affected indirectly by the governmental regulation and supervision of other insurance companies. For instance, if we are providing managing general underwriting servicesfor an insurer, we may have to contend with regulations affecting our client. Further, regulation affecting the insurance companies with whom our brokers place business can affect how we conduct thoseoperations.         Mostinsurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors. In the U.S., this system of regulation, generallyadministered by a department of insurance in each state in which we do business, affects the way we can conduct our insurance underwriting business. Laws in each of the states in which we operateextensively regulate our sales practices, operations, marketing and advertising by requiring, among other things, prior approval and/or notice of new products, premium rates, benefit changes andcertain material transactions, including dividend payments to stockholders, purchases or sales of assets and inter-company agreements. Furthermore, state insurance departments conduct periodicexaminations, audits and investigations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies, holdingcompany issues and other matters.         Althoughthe federal government does not directly regulate the insurance business, federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including employee benefit planregulation, Medicare, age, race, disability and sex discrimination, investment company regulation, financial services regulation, securities laws and federal taxation, do affect the insurance industrygenerally and our insurance underwriting subsidiaries in particular. For instance, several laws and regulations adopted by the federal government, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the HealthInsurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and ""Do Not Call"" regulations, have created additional administrativeand compliance requirements for us.         Withrespect to our international operations, we are subject to various regulations relating to, among other things, licensing, currency, policy language and terms, reserves and theamount of local investment. These various regulations also add to our cost of doing business through increased compliance expenses, the financial impact of use of capital restrictions and increasedtraining and 13 employeeexpenses. Furthermore, the loss of a license in a particular jurisdiction could restrict or eliminate our ability to conduct business in that jurisdiction.         Inall jurisdictions the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities. Generally, such authorities are vested with relativelybroad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations. Accordingly, we may be precluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of ouractivities or otherwise fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction. No assurances can be given that our businesses can continue to be conducted in any given jurisdiction as it has been conducted inthe past. Our significant global operations expose us to various international risks that could adversely affect our business.          A significant portion of our operations are conducted outside the U.S. Accordingly, we are subject to legal, economic and market risks associated with operatingin foreign countries, including: thegeneral economic and political conditions existing in those countriesdevaluationsand fluctuations in currency exchange ratesimpositionof limitations on conversion of foreign currencies or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiariesimpositionor increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiariesdifficultiesin staffing and managing our foreign offices, and the increased travel, infrastructure and legal and compliance costs associated with multiple internationallocationshyperinflationin certain foreign countriesimpositionor increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governmentslongerpayment cyclesgreaterdifficulties in accounts receivables collectiontherequirement of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws.         Someof our foreign brokerage subsidiaries receive revenues in currencies that differ from their functional currencies. We must also translate the financial results of our foreignsubsidiaries into U.S. dollars. Although we use various derivative financial instruments to help protect against adverse transaction and translation effects due to exchange rate fluctuations, wecannot eliminate such risks and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results. Our financial results could be adversely affected if assumptions used in establishing our underwriting reserves differ from actual experience.          We maintain reserves as an estimate of our liability under insurance policies issued by our insurance underwriting operations that are in runoff. The reservesthat we maintain that could cause variability in our financial results are policy and contract claim reserves.         Policyand contract claim reserves reflect our estimated liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses, including legal and other fees and general expenses for administeringthe claims adjustment process, and for reported and unreported losses incurred as of the end of each accountingperiod. If the reserves originally established for future claims prove inadequate, we would be required to increase our liabilities, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results ofoperations and financial condition. 14         Theobligation for policy and contract claims does not represent an exact calculation of liability. Rather, reserves represent our best estimate of what we expect the ultimate settlementand administration of claims will cost. These estimates represent informed judgments based on our assessment of currently available data, as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity,frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors. Many of these factors are not quantifiable in advance and both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures,inflation, judicial and legal developments and legislative changes, can cause our estimates to vary. The inherent uncertainty of estimating reserves is greater for certain types of liabilities, wherethe variables affecting these types of claims are subject to change and long periods of time may elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made. Reserve estimates are periodicallyrefined as experience develops and further losses are reported and settled. Adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed. Because setting thelevel of reserves for policy and contract claims is inherently uncertain, we cannot assure you that our current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events. Each of our business lines may be adversely affected by an overall decline in economic activity.          The demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases,affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our brokerage and consulting businesses and the premiums generated by our underwriting businesses. In particular, a growing number of insolvenciesassociated with an economic downturn, especially insolvencies in the insurance industry, could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to placeinsurance and reinsurance business. Moreover, the results of our consulting business are generally affected by the level of business activity of our clients, which in turn is affected by the level ofeconomic activity in the industries and markets these clients serve. As our clients become adversely affected by declining business conditions, they may choose to delay or forgo consulting engagementswith us. We have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility.          As of December 31, 2007, we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately $2.1 billion. The level of debt outstanding could adverselyaffect our financial flexibility. A decline in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper may adversely affect our borrowing costs and financial flexibility.          A downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper could increase our borrowing costs and reduce our financial flexibility. In addition,certain downgrades may trigger obligations of our company to fund certain amounts with respect to our premium finance securitizations. Similarly, a downgrade would increase our commercial paperinterest rates or may result in our inability to access the commercial paper market altogether. We cannot assume that our financial position would not be adversely affected if we are unable to accessthe commercial paper market. A downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt may also adversely affect the claims-paying ability or financial strength ratings of our insurance companysubsidiaries. See ""A decline in the financial strength or claims-paying ability ratings of our insurance underwriting subsidiaries may increase policy cancellations and negatively impact new sales ofinsurance products"" above. Changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results.          We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect thereported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. We are also required to make certain judgments that affectthe reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those 15 relatingto reserves to pay policy liabilities, deferred policy acquisition costs, the valuation of investments, income taxes, stock-based compensation and contingencies and litigation. We base ourestimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates, and changes in accountingstandards could increase costs to our organization and could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations. We are a holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends in needed amounts from our subsidiaries.          Our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our subsidiaries, including our insurance underwriting companies. We have to rely on dividends from thesesubsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations and for paying dividends to stockholders and corporate expenses. Payments from our underwritingsubsidiaries are limited by governmental regulation and depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries. In some circumstances, specific payments from our insurance underwritingsubsidiaries may require priorregulatory approval and we may not be able to receive dividends from these subsidiaries at times and in the amounts we anticipate or require. We cannot guarantee that our underwriting subsidiaries' reinsurers or our reinsurers of our property and casualty business will pay in a timely fashion, if at all.          To better manage our portfolio of underwriting risk, we purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk that we assume (known as ceding) to a reinsurancecompany in exchange for part of the premium that we receive in connection with the risk. Although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred (or ceded) to thereinsurer, it does not relieve us of our liability to our policyholders. Accordingly, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers. Recently, due to industry and general economic conditions,there is an increasing risk of insolvency among reinsurance companies, resulting in a greater incidence of litigation and affecting the recoverability of claims. We cannot assure that our reinsurerswill pay the reinsurance recoverables owed to us or that they will pay these recoverables on a timely basis.         Inconnection with the sale of Aon Warranty Group (""AWG"") on November 30, 2006, Aon sold the capital stock of Virginia Surety Company, Inc. (""VSC""). Because VSC issuedproperty and casualty policies, VSC continues to remain liable to property and casualty policyholders. However, pursuant to contractual arrangements entered into as part of the sale of AWG, we haveagreed to indemnify the buyer of VSC for all obligations arising out of the property and casualty business, including any failure by reinsurers to meet their obligations with respect to the propertyand casualty business. We have also agreed to guarantee amounts owed by reinsurers in respect of the Construction Program Group (""CPG"") business issued prior to the closing of that transaction. Ifreinsurers fail to pay the reinsurance recoverables owed to VSC with respect to the property and casualty business (including with respect to CPG business) or do not pay on a timely basis, we will beresponsible for these amounts. The occurrence of natural or man-made disasters could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.          We are exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods and tornadoes, and pandemic health events suchas avian influenza, as well as man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism and military actions. For example, a natural or man-made disaster could lead to unexpectedchanges in persistency rates as policyholders and contract holders who are affected by the disaster may be unable to meet their contractual obligations, such as payment of premiums on our insurancepolicies. The continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, and a natural or man-made disaster could 16 triggeran economic downturn in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster. These consequences could, among other things, result in a decline in business and increased claims from thoseareas. Disasters also could disrupt public and private infrastructure, including communications and financial services, which could disrupt our normal business operations.         Anatural or man-made disaster also could disrupt the operations of our counterparties or result in increased prices for the products and services they provide to us. Inaddition, a disaster could adversely affect the value of the assets in our investment portfolio if it affects companies' ability to pay principal or interest on their securities. Finally, a natural orman-made disaster could increase the incidence or severity of E&O claims against the Company. In connection with the implementation of our corporate strategy, we face certain risks associated with the acquisition or disposition of businesses.          In pursuing our corporate strategy, we may acquire other businesses or dispose of or exit businesses we currently own. The success of this strategy is dependentupon our ability to identify appropriate acquisition and disposition targets, negotiate transactions on favorable terms and ultimately complete such transactions. If acquisitions are made, there canbe no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, including revenue growth, operational efficiencies or expected synergies. In addition, we may not be able tointegrate acquisitions successfully into our existing business, and we could incur or assume unknown or unanticipated liabilities or contingencies, which may impact our results of operations. If wedispose of or otherwise exit certain businesses, there can be no assurance that we will not incur certain disposition-related charges, or that we will be able to reduce overhead related to thedivested assets. The planned sale of our CICA and Sterling subsidiaries may not occur.          In December 2007, we signed separate definitive agreements to sell our CICA and Sterling subsidiaries. We anticipate that the sale of both CICA and Sterling willbe finalized in the second quarter of 2008. We cannot be certain that either of these transactions will be completed. If the closing of thesetransactions does not occur and we continue to own these subsidiaries, we may be subject to additional risk factors as follows: A decline in the financial strength or claims-paying ability ratings of our insurance underwriting subsidiaries may increase policy cancellations and negatively impact newsales of insurance products.          Financial strength and claims-paying ability ratings are factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. These ratings are based uponcriteria established by the rating agencies for the purpose of rendering an opinion as to an insurance company's financial strength, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet itsobligations to policyholders. They are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors, nor are they recommendations to buy, sell or hold specific securities. Periodically, the ratingagencies evaluate our insurance underwriting subsidiaries to confirm that they continue to meet the criteria of the ratings previously assigned to them. A downgrade, or the potential for a downgrade,of these ratings could, among other things, increase the number of policy cancellations, adversely affect relationships with brokers, retailers and other distributors of our products and services,negatively impact new sales and adversely affect our ability to compete.         CICA,the principal insurance subsidiary that underwrites our supplemental accident and health and life insurance business, is currently rated ""A"" (excellent; third highest of 16 ratinglevels) by A.M. Best Company, ""A-"" (strong; third highest of nine rating levels) for financial strength by Standard and Poor's Rating Services, and ""A3"" (good; third highest of ninerating levels) for financial strength by Moody's Investors Service and ""A-""(strong; third highest of nine rating levels) for financial strength by Fitch Ratings. We cannot assure that oneor more of the rating agencies will not downgrade or withdraw their financial strength or claims-paying ability ratings in the future. 17 Certain legislative and regulatory changes to the Medicare program have materially impacted our operations and could reduce our operating results.          Due to a legislative change enacted in late 2006, Private Fee for Service (""PFFS"") plans, including those offered by Sterling, were authorized to market andenroll beneficiaries within Medicare Advantage products year-round. This authorization was originally scheduled to remain in place until December 31, 2008. In July, this law waschanged back to the pre-2007 policy, which only permitted PFFS plan companies and other Medicare Advantage plans to maintain an open enrollment period fromJanuary 1st to March 31st. Accordingly, beginning on August 1, 2007, Sterling and all other Medicare Advantage plans no longer generallymaintain the ability to enroll beneficiaries within their plans all year long.         In2008 and beyond, Sterling and all other Medicare Advantage plans will be permitted to enroll Medicare beneficiaries until March 31st of a calendar year,unless a special enrollment period applies. Additionally, Sterling will be able to enroll year-round those individuals just becoming eligible for Medicare. As a result of this repeal ofyear-round open enrollment, Sterling's primary revenue growth opportunities will now largely be contained to its sales activities of Medicare Advantage products in the first quarter offuture years beginning in 2008 (coinciding with the open enrollment period). Our financial results could be adversely affected if assumptions used in establishing our underwriting reserves differ from actual experience.          We maintain reserves as an estimate of our liability under insurance policies issued by our insurance underwriting subsidiaries. The reserves that we maintainthat could cause variability in our financial results consist of (1) unearned premium reserves, (2) policy and contract claim reserves and (3) future policy benefit reserves.Unearned premium reserves generally reflect our liability to return premiums we have collected under policies in the event of the lapse or cancellation of those policies. Under U.S. GAAP, premiums wehave collected generally become ""earned"" over the life of a policy by means of a reduction in the amount of the unearned premium reserve associated with the policy.         Policyand contract claim reserves reflect our estimated liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses, including legal and other fees and general expenses for administeringthe claims adjustment process, and for reported and unreported losses incurred as of the end of each accounting period. If the reserves originally established for future claims prove inadequate, wewould be required to increase our liabilities, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.         Theobligation for policy and contract claims does not represent an exact calculation of liability. Rather, reserves represent our best estimate of what we expect the ultimate settlementand administration of claims will cost. These estimates represent informed judgments based on our assessment of currently available data, as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity,frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors. Many of these factors are not quantifiable in advance and both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures,inflation, judicial and legal developments and legislative changes, can cause our estimates to vary. The inherent uncertainty of estimating reserves is greater for certain types of liabilities, wherethe variables affecting these types of claims are subject to change and long periods of time may elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made. Reserve estimates are periodicallyrefined as experience develops and further losses are reported and settled. Adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed. Because setting thelevel of reserves for policy and contract claims is inherently uncertain, we cannot assure you that our current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events.         Futurepolicy benefit reserves generally relate to our liability to provide future life insurance benefits and future supplemental accident and health insurance benefits. Future policybenefit reserves 18 onsupplemental accident & health and life products have been provided on the net level premium method. These reserves are calculated based on assumptions as to investment yield, mortality,morbidity and withdrawal rates that were determined at the date of issue and provide for possible adverse deviations. The volume of premiums we write and our profitability are affected by the availability of reinsurance and the size and adequacy of our insurance company subsidiaries' capitalbase.          The level of business that our insurance underwriting subsidiaries are able to write depends on the size and adequacy of their capital base. Many state insurancelaws to which they are subject impose risk-based capital requirements for purposes of regulating insurer solvency. Insurers having less statutory surplus than that required by therisk-based capital model formula generally are subject to varying degrees of regulatory scrutiny and intervention, depending on the level of capital inadequacy. As of December 31,2007, each of our insurance company subsidiaries met the statutory surplus requirements in each jurisdiction in which it conducts business.         Wepurchase reinsurance for certain of the risks underwritten by our insurance company subsidiaries. Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of thereinsurance protection we purchase, which may affect the level of business we are able to write and our profitability. We cannot assure that we will be able to maintain our current reinsurancefacilities or that we can obtain other reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts and at favorable rates. If we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities,either our net exposures would increase or, if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures, we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments. Either of these potentialdevelopments could adversely affect our underwriting business.   Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments.             None.   Item 2.    Properties.             Aon has offices in various locations throughout the world. Substantially all of our offices are located in leased premises. The Company's executive offices occupyapproximately 530,000 square feet at 200 E. Randolph Street, Chicago, Illinois, under an operating lease agreement that expires in 2013. There are two five-year renewal options at currentmarket rates.         Ingeneral, no difficulty is anticipated in negotiating renewals as leases expire or in finding other satisfactory space if the premises become unavailable. We believe that thefacilities we occupy are adequate for the purposes for which they are currently used and are well maintained. In certain circumstances, we may have unused space and may seek to sublet such space tothird parties, depending upon the demands for office space in the locations involved.   Item 3.    Legal Proceedings.             We hereby incorporate by reference Note 15, ""Contingencies,"" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of thisreport.

The results of these operations, which were previously included in an Insurance Underwriting segment, have been reclassified todiscontinued operations for all periods presented. The results of these operations are affected by: consumerbuying habits, which are influenced by economic conditions,competitionwith other underwriters, including competition based upon claims-paying ratings,oursuccess selling new policies, selling existing policyholders more services, and having customers renew their policies, andourinvestment results.         Wehave ceased writing property and casualty insurance and have placed our remaining property and casualty operations in runoff. Results of these operations are affected primarily byclaims management and reinsurance collectibility. 26 Liquidity          Liquidity is derived from cash flows from our businesses, excluding funds held on behalf of clients, and from financing. We use liquidity to: payfor capital expenditures,repaydebt,fundacquisitions and pension obligations,repurchaseshares, andpaydividends to our stockholders.         Becausewe are a holding company, our subsidiaries may not have available cash to pay us dividends; in the case of our insurance underwriting subsidiaries, this ability is limited byregulatory and rating agency considerations. Our access to cash generated from operations outside the U.S. may be affected by tax considerations and by pension funding requirements in ourinternational pension plans. Executive Summary of 2007 Financial Results          Below is a summary of our 2007 financial results. Refer to our detailed discussion below for further details. Ourrevenues from continuing operations increased $590 million or 9% overall (2% on an organic basis). More specifically:Riskand Insurance Brokerage Services revenue increased $431 million or 8% (3% on an organic basis), andConsultingrevenue increased $70 million, driven primarily by changes in foreign exchange rates. Weuse supplemental information related to organic revenue growth to help us and our investors evaluate business growth from existing operations. Organic revenue growth excludes from reported revenuesthe impact of foreign exchange rate changes, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between business units, investment income, reimbursable expenses and unusual items. Expensesincreased 4% in 2007 due primarily to unfavorable foreign exchange and higher compensation costs, partially offset by pension savings, lower restructuring costs andsavings related to our 2005 restructuring program.Incomefrom continuing operations increased $225 million in 2007 to $672 million. Net income in 2007 was $864 million, an increase of 20% from$720 million in 2006.Weannounced that we signed separate definitive agreements to sell our CICA and Sterling subsidiaries. We expect that both transactions will be completed in the secondquarter of 2008.Wesubstantially completed the restructuring plan that began in late 2005. Total expenses of $366 million were incurred, of which $41 million was incurred in2007. We expect these efforts to reduce annual costs from our continuing operations by approximately $270 million in 2008.Beginningin the third quarter 2007, we began a global restructuring effort, intended to create a more streamlined organization and reduce future expense growth to betterserve clients. As a result of this effort, we: incurred$46 million in 2007 for workforce reduction and lease consolidation costs, asset impairments and other associated costs, and 27 expectthese efforts to reduce annual costs from our continuing operations by approximately $240 million by 2010. OurBoard of Directors increased our share repurchase program in December 2007 to $4.6 billion. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $2,777 millionremaining under the authorized share repurchase program.         Inmanaging our cash and investments during the year, we: spent$751 million to repurchase 19.1 million of our outstanding shares,contributed$211 million in cash to our major defined benefit pension plans, andrepaid$250 million of notes payable in January 2007.         InNovember 2007, we redeemed all of our remaining outstanding 31/2% Senior Convertible Debentures that were due in 2012. As a result of this redemption and earliervoluntary redemptions, we issued approximately 14 million shares of our common stock.         Allof our financial information reflects the application of critical accounting policies, estimates, assumptions and judgments, as discussed below under ""Critical Accounting Policiesand Estimates.""         Theseitems are discussed further in the remainder of this Management's Discussion and Analysis. KEY RECENT EVENTS  Sale of Businesses and Disposal of Operations          In December 2007, we announced that we signed separate definitive agreements to sell our CICA and Sterling subsidiaries. These two subsidiaries were previouslyincluded in an Insurance Underwriting segment. We expect that both transactions will be completed in the second quarter of 2008. In more detail: CICAis being sold to ACE Limited for cash consideration of $2.4 billion. Additionally, we expect a one-time dividend of $325 million from CICAbefore this transaction closes.Sterlingis being sold to Munich Re Group for cash consideration of $352 million.Thenet assets of both subsidiaries were approximately $1.4 billion at December 31, 2007.         Thesedispositions are subject to various closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals. We have included CICA and Sterling's operating results in discontinuedoperations for all periods presented.         Overthe last three years, we have sold the following additional businesses that are also included in discontinued operations: AonWarranty Group (""AWG"") and its worldwide warranty and credit operations, which were previously included in the Insurance Underwriting segment,ConstructionProgram Group (""CPG""), a managing general underwriter whose policies were underwritten by Aon's property and casualty operation, which was previously includedin both the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services and Insurance Underwriting segments,ourU.S. wholesale brokerage business, Swett & Crawford, andasmall Australian brokerage unit. 28         Resultsof the businesses included in discontinued operations are as follows: (millions)    Years ended December 312007 2006 2005Revenues$2,502 $3,430 $3,379Pretax income (loss):         Operations$326 $373 $379 Sale (10) 46  236  Total$316 $419 $615After-tax income:         Operations$189 $263 $218 Sale 3  9  101  Total$192 $272 $319        In 2007, we sold the following businesses that remain in our continuing operating results: MediaProfessionals, Inc. and two other, smaller operations, which were included in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment. We recognized total pretaxgains of $32 million on these sales.25%of our Botswana subsidiary, which is included in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment. A pretax gain of $4 million was recognized on the sale.         SeeNote 5 to the consolidated financial statements, ""Disposal of Operations,"" for further information. Restructuring Initiatives  2007 Restructuring Plan          In 2007, we: announceda global restructuring plan intended to create a more streamlined organization and reduce expense growth to better serve clients.estimatethis restructuring plan will result in cumulative pretax charges totaling approximately $360 million. Expenses will include workforce reduction and leaseconsolidation costs, asset impairments, and other expenses necessary to implement the restructuring initiative. We recorded approximately $46 million of restructuring and related expensesthrough December 31, 2007, and expect the remaining restructuring and related expenses to affect continuing operations through the end of 2009.anticipatethat these initiatives will lead to annualized cost-savings of approximately $50-$70 million in 2008,$175-$200 million in 2009, and $240 million of annualized savings by 2010. However, there can be no assurances that we will achieve the targeted savings.         The2007 Restructuring Plan eliminates an estimated 2,700 jobs beginning in the third quarter of 2007 and continuing into 2009. We also expect to close or consolidate several officesresulting in sublease losses or lease buy-outs. These efforts will also trigger asset impairments in the form of accelerated amortization of any remaining leasehold improvements. 29         Thefollowing table summarizes 2007 restructuring and related expenses by type incurred, and estimated to be incurred through the end of the restructuring initiative: (millions)Actual 2007 Estimated Total forRestructuring Period (1)Workforce reduction$17 $220Lease consolidation 22  79Asset impairments 4  41Other costs associated with restructuring 3  20Total restructuring and related expenses$46 $360(1)Actualcosts, when incurred, will vary due to changes in the assumptions built into this plan. Significant assumptions likely to change when plans are finalized and approved include,but are not limited to, changes in severance calculations, changes in the assumptions underlying our sublease loss calculations due to changing market conditions, and changes in our overall analysisthat might cause us to add or cancel component initiatives.         Workforcereductions reflect a cash expense, though we may recognize the expense before paying for the expenditure. Asset impairments are non-cash expenses. Leaseconsolidation accruals reflect the present value of future cash flows. Other costs are cash expenses, which are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.         Thefollowing table summarizes actual restructuring and related expenses incurred, and estimated to be incurred through the end of the restructuring initiative, by segment.

This three-year plan is substantially complete, andresulted in cumulative pretax expenses totaling $366 million. Restructuring costs include workforce reductions, lease consolidation costs, asset impairments and other expenses. For 2007, theestimated restructuring benefits were approximately $225 million. We expect these initiatives will lead to annualized cost savings of approximately $270 million in 2008. This estimatedoes not include any benefits related to businesses placed into discontinued operations.         Weestimate this initiative will eliminate 3,600 positions, of which over 3,500 of these eliminations had already occurred by December 31, 2007. 30         Thefollowing table details the restructuring and related expenses incurred by type.

All of the holders of theDebentures elected to convert their debentures into our common stock at a conversion rate of 46.5658 shares of common stock for each $1,000 principal amount of Debentures. As a result of thisredemption and earlier voluntary redemptions, approximately 14 million shares of our common stock were issued. Distributions from PEPS I          We received income distributions from our preferred investment in Private Equity Partnership Structures I, LLC (""PEPS I"") of $61 million during2007, which are included in investment income: Priorto 2007, income distributions received from PEPS I were limited to interest payments on various PEPS I debt instruments.Beginningin 2007, PEPS I had redeemed or collateralized all of its debt, and as a result, began to pay preferred income distributions.         Whetherwe receive additional preferred returns depends on the performance of the limited partnership (LP) interests underlying PEPS I, which we expect will vary from period to period.We do not control the timing of the distributions. Stock Repurchase Program          In November 2005, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of Aon's common stock. In November 2006, the Board increased thatamount to $2 billion. In December 2007, the Board increased the authorization amount to $4.6 billion, designating that the proceeds from the sale of our CICA and Sterling subsidiaries beused to repurchase shares. We may repurchase shares using available capital through the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time, based on prevailing market conditions. Weanticipate that the volume of share repurchases will 31 increasesubstantially after we receive the proceeds from the sales of CICA and Sterling. Any repurchased shares will be available for employee stock plans and for other corporate purposes. In 2007,we repurchased 19.1 million shares at a cost of $751 million. Since the program began, we have repurchased 48.1 million shares at a cost of $1,823 million. Of the sharesrepurchased since the program's inception, we have reissued approximately 13.8 million shares for stock options, stock awards, and other benefit plans. Tender Offer          Based upon a review of option grant practices in early 2007 by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, we determined that certain stock options weregranted at a discount from fair market value and therefore are subject to adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.         TheCompany issued a Tender Offer Statement in 2007 to permit our eligible employees to amend certain options (the ""Eligible Options"") that were granted by Aon under our Stock IncentivePlan (""Plan""). The Eligible Options include only those stock options granted by Aon: (i) that were granted under the Plan; (ii) that had an exercise price per share that was less thanthe fair market value per share of our common stock underlying the options on the options' measurement dates for accounting purposes (the ""deemed grant date""); (iii) that were unvested as ofDecember 31, 2004; (iv) that were outstanding as of the last date on which the Offer remained open for acceptance and (v) that were held by individuals who were subject totaxation in the United States. Current and former directors and executive officers of Aon were not eligible employees.         Eligibleemployees could elect to: (i) amend all (but not a portion) of their Eligible Options to increase the exercise price per share to be equal to the fair market value of ashare of our common stock on the deemed grant date (the ""Amended Exercise Price""); and (ii) for each amended Eligible Option, receive a cash payment equal to the difference between the AmendedExercise Price and the original exercise price, multiplied by the number of shares of our common stock subject to such unexercised option.         Thecash payments were paid on the first regular payroll date in January 2008. We also paid penalties, excise and other taxes of $7 million. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES          Aon's consolidated financial statements have been prepared according to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). To prepare these financialstatements, we made estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect: whatwe report as our assets and liabilities,whatwe disclose as contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, andthereported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.         Inaccordance with our policies, we: regularlyevaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments, including those concerning pensions, contingencies, policy liabilities, investments, intangible assets,share-based payments and income taxes.baseour estimates, assumptions, and judgments on our historical experience and on factors we believe reasonable under the circumstances. 32         Theresults involve judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources. If our assumptions or conditions change, the actual results wereport may differ from these estimates.         Webelieve the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments we used to prepare these consolidated financial statements. Restructuring          Restructuring costs are expensed as incurred in accordance with FASB Statement No. 112, Employers Accounting for PostemploymentBenefits and FASB Statement No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. StatementNo. 146 applies to one-time workforce reduction benefits and requires companies to use Statement No. 112 when severance is paid under an ongoing severance policy. Leaseconsolidation costs, asset impairments and other costs associated with restructuring are accounted for under Statement No. 146 and FASB Statement No. 144,  Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-LivedAssets. Workforce reduction costs          We account for workforce reduction costs that result from an ongoing severance plan under Statement No. 112. Such instances occur when (1) we havean established severance policy, (2) statutory requirements dictate the severance amounts, or (3) we have an established pattern of paying by a specific formula.         Weestimate our one-time workforce reduction costs related to exit and disposal activities not resulting from an ongoing severance plan based on the benefits available to theemployees being terminated. We recognize these costs when we: identifythe specific classification (or functions) and locations of the employees being terminated,notifythe employees who might be included in the termination, andexpectto terminate employees within the legally required notification period.         Whenemployees are receiving incentives to stay beyond the legally required notification period, we record the cost of their severance over the remaining service period. Lease consolidation costs          Where we have provided notice of cancellation pursuant to a lease agreement or abandoned space and have no intention of reoccupying it, we recognize a loss. Theloss reflects our best estimate of the net present value of the future cash flows associated with the lease at the date we vacate the property or sign a sublease arrangement. To determine the loss, wemake assumptions about the time period over which the building will remain vacant and the sublease terms.         Weestimate sublease income based on current market quotes for similar properties. When we finalize definitive agreements with the sublessee, we adjust our sublease losses for actualoutcomes. Fair value concepts of severance arrangements and sublease losses          Accounting guidance requires that our exit and disposal accruals reflect the fair value of the liability. Where material, we discount back sublease losscalculations to arrive at their net present value.         Mostworkforce reductions happen over a short span of time, so no discounting is necessary. However, we discount the severance arrangement when we terminate an employee who will provideno future service and we pay their severance over an extended period. Accretion of the discount occurs over the remaining life of the liability. 33         Forthe remaining lease term or severance payout, we decrease the liability for payments and increase the liability for accretion of the discount. The discount reflects our incrementalborrowing rate, which matches the lifetime of the liability. Other associated costs of exit and disposal activities          We recognize other restructuring costs as they are incurred, including moving costs and consulting and legal fees.         Assetimpairments may result from large-scale restructurings and we account for these impairments in the period when they become known. Furthermore, we record impairments in accordancewith Statement No. 144 by reducing the book value to the net present value of future cash flows (in situations where the asset had an identifiable cash flow stream) or accelerating thedepreciation to reflect the revised useful life. Pensions          We sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world. Our most significant plans are located in the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlandsand Canada. Significant changes to pension plans          Our U.S. pension plans are closed to new entrants, and effective January 1, 2007, we began determining future pension benefits using a ""career average pay""formula rather than the prior ""final average pay"" formula.         OurU.K. pension plans have been closed to new entrants since 1999. On March 31, 2007 future benefit accruals relating to salary and service ceased in the U.K. plans. Futureretirement benefits are now provided in a defined contribution segment of a pension scheme. Market-related value of assets          The U.S. pension plans use the market-related value of assets to determine expected return on assets.         Asof year-end 2007: themarket-related value of pension assets does not yet reflect accumulated asset gains of $6 million. These gains will decrease pension expense as they are gradedinto the market-related asset value and may be offset by future asset losses. We recognize 20% of the asset gain or loss in the current year's market-related value, with the remaining 80% spread overthe next four years.wereported a fair value of pension assets of $1,514 million, while market-related value of assets is $1,508 million.         TheU.K., Dutch and Canadian plans use fair value to determine expected return on assets. Recognition of gains and losses and prior service          In accordance with FASB Statement No. 87, we defer recognition of gains and losses that arise from events such as changes in the discount rate andactuarial assumptions, actual demographic experience and asset performance.         Unrecognizedgains and losses are amortized as a component of pension expense based on the average expected future service of active employees in the U.S., Dutch and Canadian plans, orthe average life expectancy of the U.K. plan members. We amortize prior service costs or credits which 34 ariseas a result of plan changes over a period based on the average expected future service of active employees in the plans at the time the prior service costs or credits were established.         Asof December 31, 2007, the pension plans have deferred losses that have not yet been recognized through income in the financial statements. We amortize the actuarial lossesoutside of a corridor, which is defined as 10% of the greater of market-related value of plan assets or projected benefit obligation (""PBO""). To the extent not offset by future gains, incrementalamortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense similarly until fully amortized.         Thefollowing table discloses our combined experience loss, prior service costs or credits, the number of years that we are amortizing the experience loss over, and the estimated 2008amortization by each plan: (Amounts in millions)U.S. U.K. Dutch CanadianCombined experience loss$347 $1,552 $84 $97Prior service costs (credits)$(104)$ $ $5Amortization period (years) 8  34  12  10-12Estimated 2008 amortization of loss$23 $34 $3 $5Estimated 2008 amortization of prior service cost (credit)$(15)$ $ $1Rate of return on plan assets and asset allocation          The following table summarizes the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for future pension expense and the related target asset mix:  U.S. U.K. Dutch Canadian  Expected return (total)8.60%7.20%6.60%7.00%Target equity80.00 67.00 65.00 70.00 Target fixed income20.00 33.00 35.00 30.00 Expected return-equity9.38 8.30 8.59 8.00 Expected return-fixed income5.60 4.96 5.59 5.00         We base our U.S. expected long-term return on capital market expectations for various asset classes. U.S. equities and fixed income expectations areestimated using a theoretical Capital Asset Pricing (""CAP"") Model. The CAP Model for equities included three factors: Currentdividend yield (1.7%)Corporateearnings nominal growth (6.7%)P/Eratio repricing (0.0%).         Afixed income expectation factor of 5.6% included the then-current 10-year U.S. Treasury Note yields and simulations of future yields based on expected inflationand other factors. We based: otherasset class expectations on risk premiums relative to U.S. equities and fixed income expected returns, andestimatesof volatilities and correlations among asset classes on historical data.         Theactual allocation at December 31, 2007 was 76% equities and 24% fixed income securities.         Indetermining the expected rate of return for our U.K., Dutch and Canadian plans, we analyzed investment community forecasts and current market conditions to develop expected returnsfor each of the asset classes used by the plans. We: considerhistorical performance data by asset class over long periods, and 35 weightthe expected returns for each asset class by target asset allocations of the plans.         Generally,the U.K. plans' trustees determine the investment policy for each plan. Because there are eight pension plans maintained in the U.K., our target allocation represents aweighted average of the target allocation of each plan. Further, target allocations are subject to change.         Intotal, at the end of the 2007 valuation year, the U.K. plans were invested 66% in equities and 34% in fixed income securities. The Dutch plan was invested 38% in equities and 62% infixed income securities. The Canadian plan was invested 65% in equities and 35% in fixed income securities. Impact of changing economic assumptions          Changes in the discount rate and expected return on assets can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense.         Thefollowing table reflects, holding all other assumptions constant, what a one percentage point increase and decrease in our estimated liability discount rate would have on ourestimated 2008 pension expense.  Change in discount rateIncrease (Decrease) in expense (in millions)Increase DecreaseU.S. plans$(27)$33U.K. plans (29) 31Dutch plans (6) 9Canadian plans (6) 7        The following table reflects, holding other assumptions constant, what a one percentage point increase and decrease in our estimated long-term rate ofreturn on plan assets would have on our estimated 2008 pension expense.  Change in long-term rate of return on plan assetsIncrease (Decrease) in expense (in millions)Increase DecreaseU.S. plans$(15)$15U.K. plans (39) 39Dutch plans (5) 5Canadian plans (3) 3Estimated future contributions          In the U.S., we anticipate minimum cash funding requirements of $8 million and $9 million in 2008 and 2009, respectively.         Theclosure of the U.K. schemes to future accrual and the renegotiation of cash contributions from the Company during 2007 both impacted recent and expected future cash requirements tothe U.K. plans. Under current rules and assumptions, we anticipate U.K. funding requirements of $143 million in 2008 and $146 million in 2009. These contributions reflect minimum fundingrequirements plus other amounts agreed with U.K. plan trustees.         Contributionsto the Dutch and Canadian plans are estimated to be $28 million and $16 million in 2008, respectively. 36  Contingencies          We define a contingency as any material condition that involves a degree of uncertainty that will ultimately be resolved. Under GAAP, we are required to establishreserves for contingencies when a loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate its financial impact. We do not recognize gain contingencies until the contingency is resolved.         Weare required to assess the likelihood of material adverse judgments or outcomes as well as potential ranges or probability of losses. We determine the amount of reserves required, ifany, for contingencies after carefully analyzing each individual issue. The required reserves may change due to new developments in each issue, or changes in approach, such as changing our settlementstrategy. Policy Liabilities          We collect premiums from policyholders, and we establish liabilities (reserves) to pay benefits to policyholders. The liabilities for policy benefits, claims, andunearned premiums represent our best estimates of what we expect to pay to policyholders in the future. If these liabilities prove inadequate, we would be required to increase the reserves, whichcould hurt our results and financial condition. Property & Casualty          Loss reserves reflect our estimated liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses and for reported and unreported losses incurred as of the end ofeach accounting period. Because setting loss reserve levels is inherently uncertain, we cannot guarantee that our current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events. Loss reservesrepresent our best estimate of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost, given our informed judgments based on: currentlyavailable data,futuretrends in claims severity and frequency,judicialtheories of liability, andotherfactors.         Manyof these factors are not quantifiable in advance, and both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, inflation, judicial and legal developments,and legislative changes, can cause our estimates to vary. The inherent uncertainty of estimating reserves is greater for certain types of liabilities, where the variables affecting the claims aresubject to change and long periods of time may elapse before we can definitively determine liability. We periodically refine our reserve estimates as further losses are reported and settled and wecontinue to refine our experience and reflect adjustments to reserves in the results of the periods during which such estimates are changed.         Weestimate loss reserves for all property and casualty lines of business by accident year using several standard actuarial techniques, which include, but are not limited to incurred andpaid loss development methods, the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method, and frequency/severity methods. We project ultimate losses on a direct, assumed, ceded and net basis, and deduct paid losses from theselected ultimate losses to arrive at the total indicated reserve. The total indicated reserve includes case reserves and incurred but not reported reserves.         Ourloss reserve estimates are influenced by factors such as the consistency of the results from actuarial techniques and our knowledge of emerging loss trends and rate or benefitchanges. 37 Accident & Health and Life          To establish policy liabilities, we develop estimates of reported and anticipated claims, based on our historical experience, other actuarial data, andassumptions on investment yields. The actuarial data reflects our best estimates of future expectations regarding claim frequency, claim severity, and the length of time that a customer is insured.Morbidity and mortality patterns may change over time due to many factors including improvements in the general health of the insured population, changes in lifestyle, advances in medical diagnosisand treatment, or the occurrence of a widespread pandemic.         Althoughmortality, morbidity, persistency, and interest rate assumptions are set when we issue new insurance policies, we may need to provide for additional losses on a product byincreasing reserves, reducing previously capitalized acquisition costs established for that product, or establishing premium deficiency reserves if there are significant changes in our experience orassumptions.         Liabilitiesfor incurred but unpaid claims include estimated costs relating to reported claims, and incurred, but not reported, claims. We base the liability for unpaid claims on theestimated ultimate cost of settling claims using best estimates from past experience. These estimates incorporate current trends and any other factors that influence historical data. Actualexperience, however, may vary from our estimates, due to changes in claim reporting, processing patterns, and variations from historic averages for the amount paid per claim. Variations from historicpatterns and averages could result in additional changes that increase or decrease unpaid claim liabilities.         Wegenerally accrue a liability for future policy benefits relating to long-duration contracts when we recognize premium revenue. The liability represents the present valueof future benefits to be paid to policyholders less the present value of future premiums. We estimate this liability using methods that include estimates of expected investment yields, mortality,morbidity, and policy persistency.         Actualexperience may vary from our estimates due to emerging trends in morbidity, mortality, persistency, and asset yields  and some of these trends can fluctuatesignificantly over time. As we realize the actual experience, we take into account the financial impacts of these variations from our original assumptions. When current estimates of the present valueof future benefits and expenses exceed the present value of future premiums for a product line, we recognize all excess amounts as a loss. Valuation of Investments          We periodically review securities with unrealized losses and evaluate them for other-than-temporary impairment. We analyze various riskfactors and determine if any specific asset impairment exists. If there is a specific asset impairment, we recognize a realized loss and adjust the cost basis of the impaired asset to its fair value.         Wereview invested assets with unrealized losses separated into two categories: 1.Assetswith unrealized losses due to issuer-specific events.2.Assetswith unrealized losses due to market conditions or industry-related events. Assets with unrealized losses due to issuer-specific events          At least quarterly, we review the following types of information: thecreditworthiness of corporate obligors for changes in ratings and financial performance,cashflow trends and underlying levels of collateral for asset-backed securities, andissuerfinancial trends and market expectations based on third-party analytical reports. 38         Werecognize an other-than-temporary impairment loss when appropriate for these investments with continuous unrealized losses due to issuer-specific events. Webase our decision on the facts and circumstances for each investment. Assets with unrealized losses due to market conditions or industry-related events          Invested assets with unrealized losses due to market conditions or industry-related events include those affected by: increasingU.S. Treasury or local sovereign interest rates,corporateand asset-backed credit spread widening,commonstock price volatility due to conditions in the overall market or a particular industry, andilliquidmarket conditions.         Incertain circumstances, we assume that a decline in value below cost is temporary for fixed-maturity investments, with unrealized losses due to market conditions or industry-relatedevents from which the market is expected to recover; in these cases, we can hold the investment until maturity or the market recovers, which is a decisive factor when considering an impairment loss.If we decide that holding the investment to maturity is no longer appropriate, we will reevaluate that investment for other-than-temporary impairment.         Weevaluate other-than-temporary impairment for preferred and common stock and other investments with continuous unrealized losses for two consecutive quartersdue to market conditions or industry-related events. We recognize an other-than-temporary impairment loss based upon each investment's facts and circumstances and monitor thesesecurities quarterly to ensure that unrealized losses are not the result of issuer-specific events.         Note 6to the consolidated financial statements provides additional information about our investments. Intangible Assets          Intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the value of net tangible assets of acquired businesses. We classify our intangible assets as either goodwill,client lists, non-compete agreements, or other purchased intangibles.         Althoughgoodwill is not amortized, we test it for impairment at least annually. We test more frequently if there are indicators of impairment or whenever business circumstances suggestthat the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. We perform impairment reviews at the reporting unit level. If the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be less than the carryingvalue of the reporting unit, we complete further analysis to determine whether there was an impairment loss. No further analysis was required in 2007 or 2006. We determine fair value based onestimates and assumptions related to the amount and timing of future cash flows and future interest rates. Different estimates or assumptions could produce different results. Share-based Payments          Stock-based compensation expense is based on the value of the portion of share-based payment awards that we ultimately expect to vest during that period. Thus, wehave reduced expense for estimated forfeitures. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise our estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from thoseestimates. When the terms of an award require no additional service, the award is fully expensed at the grant date. When awards are modified, 39 weaccount for the incremental shares at the fair market value at the date of modification. Expense recognition begins on the date the service period begins, which can precede or be after the grantdate, depending on the provisions of the award. Option Accounting          Before 2006, Aon was subject to Accounting Principles Board (""APB"") Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued toEmployees, in accounting for its stock-based compensation plans. Under APB No. 25, we recognized no compensation expense for stock options when the exercise price of theoptions equaled the market price of the stock at the date of grant.         In2006, we adopted Statement No. 123(R), Share-Based Payments, and changed our method of valuation for stock options granted.Beginning in 2006, we moved to a lattice-binomial option-pricing model from the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which we previously used for our required pro forma information. Lattice-basedoption valuation models: usea range of assumptions over the expected term of the options.estimateexpected volatilities based on the average of the historical volatility of Aon's stock price and the implied volatility of traded options on Aon's stock.         Furthermore,we: usehistorical data to estimate option exercise and employee terminations within the valuation model, differentiating between executives and key employees.basethe expected dividend yield assumption on our current dividend rate.basethe risk-free rate for the contractual life of the option on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.         Theexpected life of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period stock options are expected to remain outstanding, which is a derived output of the lattice-binomialmodel. Service-Based RSU Awards          Before 2006, restricted stock units (""RSUs"") granted to employees were generally service-based and accounted for by expensing the total award value over theservice period. We calculated the total award value by multiplying the total number of shares to be delivered by the quoted market value on the date of grant. In connection with the adoption ofStatement No. 123(R) in 2006, we began to estimate forfeitures and considered dividend discounts when determining the fair value of the RSUs. Performance-Based Awards          Beginning in 2006, executives and key employees may receive performance-based awards, which ultimately result in the receipt of RSUs, if the employee achieves hisor her objectives. Such objectives may be made on a personal, group or company level. The RSUs may be immediately vested or have a future additional service period. Generally, our performance awardsare fixed, which means we determine the fair value of the award at the grant date, and recognize the expense over the performance or vesting period, whichever is longer. Toexpense performance-based awards, we: estimatethe number of shares to be delivered at the end of the performance period multiplied by the fair value of those shares.recognizethe resulting value by multiplying the fair value to be delivered times the percentage of the performance period completed. 40         Theseestimates take into account performance to date as well as the assessment of future performance. These assessments are made by management using subjective estimates, such aslong-term plans. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions could have a material impact on the expense recognized.         Thelargest performance-based stock plan is the Leadership Performance Plan (""LPP""). The LPP currently has two performance periods  2006 to 2008 and 2007 to2009. A 10% upward or downward adjustment in our estimated performance targets would increase or decrease total expense by approximately $8 million. As the percent of expected performanceincreases or decreases, the potential change in expense can go from 0% to 200% of the targeted total expense. Income Taxes          We earn income in numerous foreign countries and this income is subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries, as well as U.S. federal andstate tax laws.         Thecarrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109,  Accounting for Income Taxes,and are based on management's: assumptionsand estimates about future operating results and levels of taxable income andjudgmentsregarding the interpretation of the provisions of Statement No. 109.         Weassess carryforwards and tax credits for realization as a reduction of future taxable income by using a ""more likely than not"" determination. We have not recognized a U.S. deferredtax liability for undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries of our continuing operations because they are considered permanently reinvested. Distributions may be subject to additionalU.S. income taxes if we either distribute these earnings, or we are deemed to have distributed these earnings, according to the Internal Revenue Code.         Webase the carrying values of liabilities for income taxes currently payable on management's interpretation of applicable tax laws, and incorporate management's assumptions andjudgments about using tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions. Using different estimates, assumptions and judgments in accounting for income taxes, especially those which deploy taxplanning strategies, may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and changes in our results of operations.         Weoperate in many foreign jurisdictions where tax laws relating to our businesses are not well developed. In such jurisdictions, we obtain professional guidance and consider existingindustry practices before using tax planning strategies and meeting our tax obligations. Tax returns are routinely subject to audit in most jurisdictions, and tax liabilities are frequently finalizedthrough negotiations. While historically we have not experienced significant adjustments to previously recognized tax assets and liabilities as a result of finalizing tax returns, there can be noassurance that significant adjustments will not arise. In addition, several factors could increase the future level of uncertainty over our tax liabilities, including the following: Duringrecent years, the portion of our overall operations conducted in foreign tax jurisdictions has been increasing, and we anticipate this trend will continue.Todeploy tax planning strategies and conduct foreign operations efficiently, our subsidiaries frequently enter into transactions with affiliates, which are generallysubject to complex tax regulations and are frequently reviewed by tax authorities.Wemay conduct future operations in certain tax jurisdictions where tax laws are not well developed, and it may be difficult to secure adequate professional guidance. 41 Taxlaws, regulations, agreements and treaties change frequently, requiring us to modify existing tax strategies to conform to such changes.         Infirst quarter 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  anInterpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes which are recognized in a company's financial statementsin accordance with Statement No. 109, and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a company's tax return. As a result of ouradoption of FIN 48, we did not record any adjustments to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS  General          In our discussion of operating results, we sometimes refer to supplemental information derived from consolidated financial information.         Weuse supplemental information related to organic revenue growth to help us and our investors evaluate business growth from existing operations. Organic revenue growth excludes fromreported revenues the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between business units, investment income, reimbursable expenses, and unusual items.         Supplementalorganic revenue growth information should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our consolidated statements of income. Industry peers provide similar supplementalinformation about their revenue performance, although they may not make identical adjustments.         Becausewe conduct business in more than 120 countries, foreign exchange rate fluctuations have a significant impact on our business. In comparison to the U.S. dollar, foreign exchangerate movements may be significant and may distort true period-to-period comparisons of changes in revenue or pretax income. Therefore, we have: isolatedthe impact of the change in currencies between periods by providing percentage changes on a comparable currency basis for revenue, and have disclosed the impact onexpenses and earnings per share, andprovidedthis form of reporting to give financial statement users more meaningful information about our operations.         Sometables in the segment discussions reconcile organic revenue growth percentages to the reported revenue growth percentages for the segments and subsegments. We disclose separately: theimpact of foreign currency, andtheimpact from acquisitions, divestitures, and transfers of business units, which represent the most significant reconciling items.         Inan ""all other"" category, we total other reconciling items that are not generally significant individually or in the aggregate. If there is a significant individual reconciling itemwithin the ""all other"" category, we provide additional disclosure in a note. 42 Summary of Results for 2005 through 2007          The consolidated results of continuing operations follow: (millions)            Years ended December 31,2007 2006 2005  Revenue:          Commissions, fees and other$7,170 $6,660 $6,507  Investment income 301  221  144     Total consolidated revenue 7,471  6,881  6,651  Expenses:          Compensation and benefits 4,388  4,225  4,084  Other general expenses 1,726  1,637  1,616  Depreciation and amortization 194  224  244  Interest expense 138  129  125  Provision for New York and other state settlements 1  3  5     Total expenses 6,447  6,218  6,074  Income from continuing operations before provision for income tax$1,024 $663 $577  Pretax margin  continuing operations 13.7% 9.6% 8.7% Consolidated Results for 2007 Compared to 2006  Revenue          During 2007, compared to the prior year: Commissions, fees and other increased $510 million or 8% driven primarily by the impact of changes in foreign exchangerates and organic revenue growth of 2%.Investment income increased $80 million or 36%.

Expenses          The increase in total expenses of $229 million or 4% from 2006 is driven by: $163 millionor 4% increase in compensation and benefits, reflecting $189 million of unfavorable foreignexchange as well as higher salary and incentive costs, which more than offset significant pension savings, lower restructuring costs and the benefits of the 2005 restructuring program. Reduced pensionexpense was due primarily to plan amendments in the U.S. and U.K.$89 millionor 5% increase in other general expenses, reflecting unfavorable foreign exchange, the gain on the 2006sale of our building in Spain, the impact of acquisitions and the settlement of litigation in early 2007 for acquired employees in our U.K. reinsurance business. These items more than offset a 2006property and casualty reserve increase and 2007 gains from the sale of businesses.$9 millionincrease in interest expense resulting from higher interest rates and foreign exchange translation.         Theseincreases in expenses were partially offset by a $30 million decrease in depreciation and amortization due to lowerwrite-offs and a lower depreciable base than the prior year. 44 Income from Continuing Operations before Provision for Income Tax and Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle          Income from continuing operations was $1,024 million, a 54% increase from $663 million in 2006. The increase was driven by improved profitability inour brokerage and consulting segments, distributions from our PEPS I investment, and an increase in our property and casualty reserves in 2006. Provision for Income Taxes          The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 34.4% in 2007 and 32.6% in 2006.         Differencesbetween the overall effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate are typically due to U.S. state income taxes and differences between U.S. and international taxrates. Changes in the mix between our U.S. and international pretax income directly affect our effective tax rates. In 2007 and 2006, our effective tax rate also reflects the favorable resolution oftax examination issues, adjustments, and tax credits. In addition, our 2007 rate was impacted by changes in corporate tax rates in certain foreign countries, most notably in the United Kingdom, whichreduced the enacted corporate tax rate from 30% to 28%. While the lower U.K. tax rate will benefit Aon's recurring effective tax rate in future periods, we had to remeasure our U.K. deferred taxassets using the new enacted tax rate, resulting in a one-time non-cash expense of $24 million. For a summary of these effects, please see the rate reconciliationprovided in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. Income from Continuing Operations          In 2007, compared to 2006: Income from continuing operations rose to $672 million ($2.10 diluted net income per share) from $447 million($1.33 diluted net income per share). 2007 income from continuing operations included currency translation gains of $0.06 per share, compared to currency translation losses of $0.04 per share in 2006.Basic net income per share from continuing operations increased to $2.25 from $1.41. Discontinued Operations          After-tax income from discontinued operations was: $192 million in 2007 ($0.65 and $0.59 per basic and dilutive net income per share, respectively). These resultsinclude a full year of operations for CICA and Sterling ($0.63 and $0.58 per basic and dilutive net income per share, respectively) as well as residual settlement activity relating to our 2006 AWG andCPG disposals.$272 million in 2006 ($0.86 and $0.80 per basic and dilutive income per share, respectively). Results in 2006 includea full year of operations for CICA and Sterling ($0.56 and $0.52 per basic and dilutive net income per share, respectively) and eleven months of operations and the gain on sale of AWG and CPG ($0.27and $0.25 per basic and dilutive net income per share, respectively).         Revenuefor discontinued operations decreased to $2.5 billion in 2007 from $3.4 billion in 2006 due to the inclusion in 2006 of AWG and CPG. CICA's revenue increased 21% to$2.5 billion on the strength of Sterling's Medicare Advantage product. After-tax income from discontinued operations declined $80 million to $192 million, driven by the inclusionlast year of AWG and CPG results, along with the gain on the sale of those two operations. CICA's results improved $7 million to $186 million. An increase in pretax income, driven byincreased revenue, was mainly offset by lower margins at 45 Sterlingand a higher tax provision, resulting from a $28 million non-recurring tax adjustment related to the recognition of deferred taxes of CICA's foreign subsidiaries.         SeeNote 5 to the consolidated financial statements, ""Disposal of Operations,"" for further information. Consolidated Results for 2006 Compared to 2005  Revenue          In 2006, compared to the prior year: Commissions, fees and other increased by $153 million or 2%, driven by 2% organic revenue growth in Risk and InsuranceBrokerage Services and 4% organic growth in Consulting.Investment income increased $77 million or 53%, driven by higher interest rates and a $35 million gainrecognized in connection with the contribution of our Scandent preferred stock investment to a U.K. pension plan.         Bygeography: U.S.  revenue, which represented 41% of total revenue, increased $63 million or2%, reflecting improved results in our retail business and increased investment income.Americas other than U.S. revenue increased 12% to $723 million, due to strong growth in Latin America.United Kingdom revenue decreased $54 million or 4%, reflecting soft market conditions in our retail and reinsurancelines, partially offset by growth in our consulting business.Europe, Middle East & Africa revenue increased 7% to $1.6 billion, as a result of acquisitions and organicgrowth in our retail business.         Asia Pacific revenue increased $38 million or 7% to $561 million, driven by acquisitions and organic revenue growth inemerging markets in Asia.  Expenses          The $144 million or 2% increase in total expenses versus 2005 is driven by: $141 millionor 3% increase in compensation and benefits, reflecting higher salary and incentive costs, the impact ofacquisitions and unfavorable foreign exchange, andanincrease of $21 million or 1% in other general expenses, primarily reflecting a property and casualty reserveincrease, hedging losses, and unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by a $30 million gain on the sale of our building in Spain. Theseincreases were somewhat offset by a decrease of $20 million in depreciation and amortization expense, reflecting greater asset disposalsand impairments in 2005. Income from Continuing Operations before Provision for Income Tax and Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle          Income from continuing operations before provision for income tax increased $86 million to $663 million. The increase was driven by organic revenuegrowth across each segment along with estimated restructuring savings of $119 million, partially offset by higher compensation and benefits costs. 46 Provision for Income Taxes          The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 32.6% in 2006 and 27.9% in 2005. Differences between the overall effective tax rate and the U.S.federal statutory rate are typically due to U.S. state income taxes and differences between U.S. and international tax rates. Changes in the mix between our U.S. and international pretax incomedirectly affect our effective tax rates. In 2006 and 2005, our effective tax rate also reflects the favorable resolution of tax examination issues, adjustments, and tax credits. Income from Continuing Operations          In 2006, compared to 2005: Income from continuing operations rose to $447 million ($1.33 dilutive net income per share) from $416 million($1.24 dilutive net income per share). For 2006, income from continuing operations included currency translation losses of $0.04 per share, compared to currency translation gains of $0.05 per share in2005.Basic net income per share from continuing operations increased to $1.41 from $1.28.         Tocompute income per share in 2005, we deducted dividends paid on the redeemable preferred stock from net income. The redeemable preferred stock was redeemed and retired in September2005. Discontinued Operations          After-tax income from discontinued operations was: $272 million in 2006 ($0.86 and $0.80 per basic and dilutive net income per share, respectively). 2006 discontinuedoperations include full year results for CICA and Sterling ($0.56 and$0.52 per basic and dilutive net income per share, respectively) and eleven months of operations and gain on sale of AWG and CPG ($0.27 and $0.25 per basic and dilutive net income per share,respectively.)$319 million in 2005 ($0.99 and $0.93 per basic and dilutive net income per share, respectively). Results in 2005include full year results for CICA, Sterling, AWG and CPG ($0.69 and $0.65 per basic and dilutive net income per share, respectively), along with nine months of operations and the gain on sale of ourSwett & Crawford operation ($0.33 and $0.31 per basic and dilutive net income per share, respectively). REVIEW BY SEGMENT  General          Aon classifies its businesses into two operating segments: Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services and Consulting (see Note 16 to the consolidated financialstatements for further information).         Aon'soperating segments are identified as those that report separate financial information and are evaluated regularly when we are deciding how to allocate resources and assessperformance.         Segmentrevenue includes investment income generated by invested assets of that segment, as well as the impact of related derivatives. Our Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services andConsulting businesses invest funds held on behalf of clients and operating funds in short-term obligations. 47         Thefollowing tables and commentary provide selected financial information on the operating segments.

See Note 16 to the consolidatedfinancial statements for further information. Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services          Aon is a leader in many sectors of the insurance industry. Aon was ranked by A.M. Best as the number one globalinsurance brokerage in 2007 based on brokerage revenues, and voted the best insurance intermediary and best reinsurance intermediary in 2007 by the readers of BusinessInsurance.         Changesin premiums have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry, as commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid byinsureds. Insurance premiums are cyclical, and may vary widely based on market conditions. Premium rates usually increase when the industry has heavier than expected losses or capital shortages; thissituation is referred to as a ""hard market."" A hard market tends to increase commission revenues. Conversely, a ""soft market,"" characterized by flat or reduced premium rates, results from increasedcompetition for market share among insurance carriers or increased underwriting capacity. A soft market tends to reduce commission revenues. Hard and soft markets may be broad-based or more narrowlyfocused across certain product lines or geographic areas. Markets began softening in 2004. We experienced a soft market in many business lines/segments and in many geographic areas in 2007. Pricesfell throughout the year, with the greatest declines seen in large and middle-market accounts. We expect the soft market to continue into 2008.         Riskand Insurance Brokerage Services generated approximately 82% of Aon's total operating segment revenues in 2007. Revenues are generated primarily through: feespaid by clients,commissionsand fees paid by insurance and reinsurance companies, andinterestincome on funds held on behalf of clients.         Ourrevenues vary from quarter to quarter throughout the year as a result of: thetiming of our clients' policy renewals,thenet effect of new and lost business,thetiming of services provided to our clients, andtheincome we earn on investments, which is heavily influenced by short-term interest rates. 48         Ourrisk brokerage companies operate in a highly competitive industry and compete with many retail insurance brokerage and agency firms, as well as with individual brokers, agents, anddirect writers of insurance coverage. Specifically, this segment: addressesthe highly specialized product development and risk management needs of commercial enterprises, professional groups, insurance companies, governments, healthcareproviders, and non-profit groups, among others;providesaffinity products for professional liability, life, disability income, and personal lines for individuals, associations, and businesses;providesreinsurance services to insurance and reinsurance companies and other risk assumption entities by acting as brokers or intermediaries on all classes of reinsurance;providesmanaging underwriting and premium finance services to independent agents and brokers as well as corporate clients;providesactuarial, loss prevention, and administrative services to businesses and consumers; andmanagescaptive insurance companies.         Wereview our revenue results using the following subsegments: Risk Management and Insurance Brokerage encompasses our retail brokerage services, affinity products, managing generalunderwriting, placement and captive management services, and premium finance services in the following areas: Americas; United Kingdom; Europe, Middle East & Africa; andAsia Pacific. In February 2008, we announced that we intend to combine our entire local, regional and national risk and insurance retail brokerage operations into a single,unified business to be called Aon Risk Services.Reinsurance Brokerage and Related Services (Reinsurance) offers sophisticated advisory services in program design and claimrecoveries that:     enhancethe risk/return characteristics of insurance policy portfolios,     improvecapital utilization, and     evaluateand mitigate catastrophic loss exposures worldwide.

Contributing to increased margins and pretax income were: 3%organic revenue growth,lowerpension expense,lowerrestructuring expenses,savingsfrom the 2005 restructuring program (primarily workforce reduction),$36 millionof gains on the sale of businesses, andfavorableforeign exchange rates.         Theseincreases were partially offset by higher salary costs due to investing in talent and a $21 million litigation settlement for acquired employees in our U.K. reinsurancebusiness. In addition, in 2006, we recognized a $35 million gain on the contribution of our Scandent preferred stock and a $30 million gain on the sale of a building in Spain. Consulting          Aon Consulting is one of the world's largest integrated human capital consulting organizations. Our consulting segment: providesa broad range of consulting services, andgenerated18% of Aon's total operating segment revenues in 2007.         Wereview our revenue results using the following subsegments: Consulting Services, which provides consulting services in six practice areas:1.Employee Benefits advises clients about how to structure, fund, and administer employee benefit programs that attract, retain, andmotivate employees.

Income Before Income Tax          Pretax income was $189 million, an increase of $69 million or 58% from 2006. 2007 pretax margins in this segment were 14.0%, an increase of 460basis points from 9.4% in 2006. The pretax income and margin improvement was principally driven by: organicrevenue growth in Consulting Services,thefavorable impact of foreign currency translation,lowerrestructuring costs,benefitsrelated to the 2005 restructuring program,disciplinedexpense management in the U.S., andthegain on the sale of an investment. Unallocated Income and Expense          Unallocated income consists primarily of investment income (including income or loss on investment disposals and other-than-temporaryimpairment losses), which is not otherwise reflected in the operating segments. We include invested assets and related investment income not directly required to support the risk and insurancebrokerage services and consulting businesses.         ThroughMarch 31, 2006, we carried our investment in Endurance warrants at fair value and recorded changes in the fair value through unallocated investment income. OnMarch 31, 2006, we contributed the investment in Endurance warrants to our U.K. pension plans.         Privateequities are principally carried at cost; however, where we have significant influence, they are reported using the equity method of accounting. These investments usually do notpay 53 dividends. LPsare accounted for using the equity method and changes in the value of the underlying LP investments flow through unallocated investment income.         Unallocatedincome also includes the operations of our Property and Casualty runoff business. We previously included results related to this business in our former Insurance Underwritingsegment.         Thistable details our unallocated income and expense.

We contributed these warrants to the U.K. pension plans onMarch 31, 2006.         Unallocated expenses include corporate governance costs not attributable to the operating segments. These expenses increased to$132 million in 2007 from $106 million in 2006, driven by: higherCorporate executive staff expenses,resolutionof a $15 million reconciliation difference in the U.K., andexpensesassociated with a review of historical equity compensation practices.         Property and Casualty revenues declined from $15 million in 2006 to $8 million in 2007, as that business continues to winddown. Associated expenses were $21 million in 2007 versus $93 million in 2006. 2006's results included an increase in our reserves of$81 million, reflecting adverse development, refined assumptions and additional claim information relating to programs placed in runoff.         Interest expense, which represents the cost of our worldwide debt obligations, increased $9 million in 2007 to $138 million,principally due to higher interest rates and the impact of foreign exchange rates. FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY  Liquidity          Our operating subsidiaries obtain liquidity through selling their products and services and collecting their receivables. These subsidiaries use the fundscollected to pay creditors and employees and to fund acquisitions. They segregate funds that Aon is holding on behalf of clients to satisfy policyholder liabilities, so they are not available forother uses. We believe that our operating subsidiaries will have adequate liquidity to meet their needs in the foreseeable future and to provide funds to the parent company. Since governmentregulations limit payment of dividends from our underwriting subsidiaries, dividends depend on the subsidiaries' surplus and future earnings.         Ourparent company's routine liquidity needs include paying corporate expenses, servicing debt, and paying dividends on Aon's outstanding stock. We meet these requirements primarilythrough 54 dividendsand internal financing from our operating subsidiaries. We may also use available liquidity for capital expenditures and repurchasing common stock.         Cashin our consolidated statements of financial position includes funds available for operations.         During2007, we: redeemed$250 million of debt securities in January 2007,redeemedall of our remaining 31/2% Senior Convertible Debentures that were due in 2012. We converted these debentures into approximately 14 millionshares of Aon common stock, andspent$751 million to repurchase 19.1 million of our outstanding shares of common stock.         In2007, total cash contributions to our major defined benefit pension plans were $211 million, versus cash contributions of $204 million in 2006. Also in 2006, wecontributed $166 million of non-cash financial instruments to certain of our U.K. plans. Under current rules and assumptions, we anticipate 2008 contributions to our major definedbenefit pension plans of approximately $195 million.         In2007, our principal U.K. subsidiary agreed with the trustees of the plan to contribute £9.4 million ($19 million) per year to one of our U.K. pension plansfor the next six years, with the amount payable increasing by 5.3% on each April 1. These contributions are in addition to the normal employer contributions to the plan. The trustees of theplan: havecertain rights to request that our U.K. subsidiary advance an amount equal to an actuarially determined winding-up deficit. As of December 31, 2006,the estimated winding-up deficit was £300 million ($595 million at December 31, 2007 exchange rates).haveaccepted in practice the agreed-upon schedule of contributions and have not requested an advance.  Cash Flows & Financial Condition          Cash flows from operations represent the net income we earned in the reported periods adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in operating assetsand liabilities.         Cashflows provided by operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: (millions)        Twelve months ended December 312007 2006  Insurance Underwriting operating cash flows (including AWG & CPG for 2006)$335 $522 All other operating cash flows 904  596     1,239  1,118 Change in funds held on behalf of brokerage and consulting clients 50  (150) Cash provided by operating activities$1,289 $968  Insurance Underwriting operating cash flows          Our 2007 insurance underwriting operations include accident & health and life and certain property & casualty businesses in runoff. These insuranceproducts have distinct differences in the timing of premiums earned and payment of future liabilities. The 2006 cash flows include the operations of AWG and CPG, sold on November 30, 2006.         Theoperating cash flow from our insurance subsidiaries was $335 million for 2007, a decrease of $187 million compared to 2006. This decrease was primarily related to thesale of AWG and CPG. For 2007, operating cash flows, analyzed by major income statement component, indicated that premium and other fees collected, net of reinsurance, were $2,339 millioncompared to $3,546 million in 2006. 55 Investmentand other miscellaneous income received was $183 million and $235 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively.         Theinsurance underwriting subsidiaries used revenues generated from premiums, investments and other miscellaneous income to pay claims and other cash benefits, commissions, generalexpenses and taxes. Claims and other cash benefits paid were $1,321 million in 2007 versus $1,632 million in 2006. Commissions and general expenses paid were $793 million for2007, compared to $1,483 million in 2006. Tax payments for 2007 were $73 million compared to $144 million last year.         Thesesubsidiaries invest and use operating cash flows to satisfy future benefits to policyholders and when appropriate, make them available to pay dividends to the Aon parent company.         Generally,the subsidiaries invest in highly liquid and marketable investment grade securities to support policy liabilities. These invested assets are subject to insurance regulationsset forth by the various governmental jurisdictions in which they operate, both domestically and internationally. The insurance regulations may restrict both the quantity and quality of various typesof assets within the portfolios.         Theinsurance subsidiaries' policy liabilities are segmented among multiple accident and health and property casualty portfolios. Those portfolios have widely varying estimated durationsand interest rate characteristics. Generally, the policy liabilities are not subject to interest rate volatility risk. Therefore, in many of the portfolios, asset and policy liability duration are notclosely matched. Interest rate sensitive policy liabilities are generally supported by floating rate assets. Funds held on behalf of clients          In our Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services and Consulting segments, we typically hold funds on behalf of clients as a result of: premiumsreceived from clients that are in transit to insurers. These premiums held on behalf of, or due from, clients are reported as assets with a corresponding liabilitydue to the insurer.claimsdue to clients that are in transit from insurers. Claims held by, or due to us and which are due to clients, are also shown as both assets and liabilities.         Thesefunds held on behalf of clients are generally invested in interest bearing trust accounts and can fluctuate significantly depending on when we collect cash from our clients andwhen premiums are remitted to the insurance carriers. All other operating cash flows          The operating cash flow from our Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services and Consulting segments, as well as related corporate items, was $904 million in2007 compared to $596 million in 2006. These amounts exclude the change in funds held on behalf of clients as described above. The operating cash flows depend on the timing of receipts andpayments related to revenues, incentive compensation, other operating expenses and income taxes.         Aonuses the excess cash generated by our brokerage and consulting businesses as well as dividends received from the insurance subsidiaries to meet its liquidity needs, which consist ofservicing its debt, paying dividends to its stockholders and repurchasing outstanding shares. Investing and Financing Activities          We used the consolidated cash flow from operations (net of funds held on behalf of clients) for: investingactivities of $463 million. The cash flows used by investing activities included purchases, net of sales of investments, of $95 million; capitalexpenditures, net of disposals, of $170 million; and acquisition of subsidiaries, net of divestitures of $198 million.financingneeds of $579 million. Financing uses primarily included cash dividends paid to shareholders of $176 million and net share activity of$495 million. Proceeds from financing activities are $92 million from the issuance of debt, net of repayments. 56 Financial Condition          Due to the nature of operations, insurance underwriting organizations generally do not classify assets and liabilities on their statements of financial positionas current and noncurrent, and we had not previously reported a classified statement of financial position. Due to the pending sales of a majority of our underwriting operations, atDecember 31, 2007 we have reported our statements of financial position on a classified basis.         Comparingyear-end 2007 with year-end 2006: Working capital increased $133 million to $3.4 billion.Receivables and Insurance premium payables declined $253 million and$206 million, respectively. The decrease in both receivables and payables reflects:Thetiming of receipts and payments,Clientdemands for risk programs, andTheeffect of foreign exchange ratesNetassets of our CICA and Sterling subsidiaries increased $223 million.Short-term debt increased by $210 million as a result of considering $250 million of our borrowingsunder our Euro facility as payable within a year.Goodwill increased $414 million as a result of several acquisitions made during the year in our Risk and InsuranceBrokerage segment, which was slightly offset by the sale of two MGUs.Long-term debt decreased by $350 million, reflecting decreases in U.S. borrowings, offset in part byhigher Euro facility borrowings.Pensions, post employment and post retirement liabilities declined by $190 million as a result of cash contributionsto our various pension plans.Other non-current liabilities decreased by $124 million due primarily to lower restructuring reserves anda decline in our policy and contract claims reserves at our property and casualty runoff business. Investments          We invest in broad asset categories related to our diversified operations. In managing our investments, our objective is to maximize earnings while monitoringasset and liability durations, interest and credit risks, and regulatory requirements. We do not allocate to the operating segments invested assets or related investment income not directly requiredto support the insurance brokerage and consulting businesses.         SeeNote 6 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our investments. Borrowings          Total debt at December 31, 2007, was $2.1 billion, a decrease of $140 million from December 31, 2006. Our long-term debtdecreased by $350 million compared to year-end 2006. This decrease results from: redeeming$250 million of debt securities in January 2007, andconverting$300 million of our outstanding 31/2% Senior Convertible Debentures that were due in 2012 to our common stock. 57         Thesedecreases were partially offset by higher borrowings in Europe.         Ourtotal debt as a percentage of total capital was 25.6% and 30.5% at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.         Wehave disclosed future payments of our long-term debt and operating lease commitments (with initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of oneyear) in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.         AtDecember 31, 2007, we had a $600 million unused U.S. committed bank credit facility, which expires in February 2010, to support commercial paper and othershort-term borrowings. This facility allows us to issue up to $150 million in letters of credit.         Wealso have several foreign credit facilities available. At December 31, 2007, we had available to us: afive-year €650 million ($942 million) multi-currency facility, of which $795 million was outstanding atDecember 31, 2007. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on both our U.S. and Euro facilities.a£37.5 million ($74 million) facility.a364-day €25 million (U.S. $36 million) facility.a€20 million (U.S. $29 million) open-ended facility.         Thistable shows the major rating agencies' ratings of our debt at February 25, 2008:   Seniorlong-term debt  Commercial paper   Rating  Outlook  Rating  Outlook Standard & Poor's BBB+ Stable A-2 StableMoody's Investor Services Baa2 Positive P-2 PositiveFitch, Inc. BBB+ Stable F-2 Stable        During 2007, Standard & Poor's changed its outlook on Aon's commercial paper from positive to stable.         Adowngrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper would: increaseour borrowing costs and reduce our financial flexibility, andincreaseour commercial paper interest rates or possibly restrict our access to the commercial paper market altogether. Although we have committed backup lines, we cannotensure that our financial position will not be hurt if we can no longer access the commercial paper market. Stockholders' Equity          Stockholders' equity increased $1.0 billion during 2007 to $6.2 billion, driven primarily by: $864 millionof net income, anda$495 million increase in capital stock and additional paid-in-capital, principally due to the redemption of our 31/2% seniorconvertible debentures, as well as stock issued in connection with employee benefit plans.         Partiallyoffsetting this increase was a $391 million increase in treasury stock, reflecting stock repurchases, net of reissuance of treasury stock in connection with employee benefitplans. 58         Accumulatedother comprehensive loss decreased $284 million since December 31, 2006. Compared to year-end 2006: netforeign exchange translation increased by $166 million because of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies,netderivative gains increased $9 million,netunrealized investment gains rose $3 million, andournet recognized losses and unrecognized prior service credits decreased by $106 million. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements          We record various contractual obligations as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as certain purchase commitments and otherexecutory contracts, are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements, but we are required to disclose them.         Aonand its subsidiaries have issued letters of credit to cover contingent payments of approximately $4 million for taxes and other business obligations to third parties. Weaccrue amounts in our consolidated financial statements for these letters of credit to the extent they are probable and estimable.         Followingthe guidance of FASB Statement No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment ofLiabilities, and other relevant accounting guidance, we use special purpose entities and qualifying special purpose entities (""QSPE's""), also known as special purpose vehicles,in some of our operations. Reinsurance Guarantee          In connection with the AWG transaction, we issued an indemnification which protects the purchaser from credit exposure relating to the property and casualtyreserves that have been reinsured. These reinsurance recoverables amount to $846 million at December 31, 2007. We recorded a $13 million liability reflecting the fair value ofthis indemnification as of November 30, 2006. The value is approximately $12 million as of December 31, 2007. The indemnification represents the present value of theindemnification on the credit risk of the reinsurers. Premium Financing          Some of our U.S., U.K., Canadian, and Australian subsidiaries originate short-term loans (generally with terms of 12 months or less) tobusinesses to finance their insurance premium obligations, and then sell these premium finance agreements in securitization transactions that meet the criteria for sale accounting. These salesinvolve: specialpurpose entities (""SPEs""), which are considered QSPEs by Statement No. 140, and following Statement No. 140, should not be consolidated in thefinancial statements of a transferor or its affiliates (Aon's subsidiaries), andmulti-seller,non-qualified bank commercial paper conduit SPEs (""Bank SPEs""), which are variable interest entities according to FIN 46.         Wehave analyzed qualitative and quantitative factors related to our subsidiaries' interests in the Bank SPEs and have determined that these subsidiaries are not the sponsors of the BankSPEs. Additionally, independent third parties: havemade substantial equity investments in the Bank SPEs,havevoting control of the Bank SPEs, and 59 generallybear the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets of the Bank SPEs.         Thus,we have concluded that non-consolidation of the Bank SPEs is appropriate given that our subsidiaries do not have significant variable interests.         Throughthe securitization agreements, we, or one of our QSPEs, sell undivided interests in specified premium finance agreements to the Bank SPEs. The total amount advanced on premiumfinance agreements sold to the Bank SPEs at any one time is limited by the securitization agreements to $1.8 billion. The Bank SPEs had advanced $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion atDecember 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The: originationand sale of eligible premium finance agreements to the Bank SPEs increase available advances, andcollectionson previously sold agreements, which we administer, reduce available advances.         Werecord gains associated with the sale of receivables. When we calculate the gain, we include all anticipated fees we incurred for this facility. The gains, which are included incommissions, fees and other revenue in the consolidated statements of income, were $64 million, $63 million, and $65 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006,and 2005, respectively.         Werecord at fair value our retained interest in the sold premium finance agreements, and report it in insurance brokerage and consulting services receivables in the consolidatedstatements of financial position. We also retain servicing rights for sold agreements and earn servicing fee income over the servicing period, including these servicing fees in the gain/losscalculation.         Becausethe fair value of the servicing rights approximates the estimated costs to service the receivables at December 31, 2007 and 2006, we have not recorded any servicing assetsor liabilities.         Weestimate fair value by discounting estimated future cash flows from our retained interest in the sold receivables, using discount rates that approximate current market rates andexpected future prepayment rates.         TheBank SPEs bear the credit risks on the receivables, subject to limited recourse in the form of over-collateralization required on the sales of the receivables.         Allbut the Australian facility require Aon to maintain the following covenants: consolidatednet worth, as defined, of at least $2.5 billion,consolidatedEBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) to consolidated net interest of at least 4 to 1, andconsolidatedindebtedness to consolidated EBITDA of no more than 3 to 1.         Weintend to renew these conduit facilities when they expire. If there were adverse bank, regulatory, tax, or accounting rule changes, our access to the conduit facilities and specialpurpose vehicles would be restricted. Following the appropriate accounting standards, these special purpose vehicles are not included in our consolidated financial statements. PEPS I          In 2001, we sold the vast majority of our LP portfolio, valued at $450 million, to PEPS I, a QSPE. The common stock interest in PEPS I isheld by a limited liability company owned by us (49%) and by a charitable trust, which we do not control, established for victims of the September 11th attacks (51%). We have notincluded the assets and liabilities and operations of PEPS I in our consolidated financial statements. 60         In2001, PEPS I sold approximately $171 million of investment grade fixed-maturity securities to unaffiliated third parties. PEPS I then paid our insuranceunderwriting subsidiaries the $171 million in cash and issued them an additional $279 million in fixed-maturity and preferred stock securities.         Aspart of this transaction, Aon is required to purchase additional fixed-maturity securities from PEPS I in an amount equal to the unfunded LP commitments as they arerequested. These fixed-maturity securities are rated below investment grade. As of December 31, 2007, the unfunded commitments amounted to $44 million. These commitments have specificexpiration dates, and the general partners may decide not to draw on these commitments.         Wereceived income distributions from our preferred investment in PEPS I of $61 million during 2007, which are included in investment income. Prior to 2007, incomedistributions received from PEPS I were limited to interest payments on various PEPS I debt instruments. Beginning in 2007, PEPS I had redeemed or collateralized all of its debt,and as a result, began to pay preferred income distributions. Whether we receive additional preferred returns will depend on the performance of the LP interests underlying PEPS I, which weexpect to vary from period to period. We do not control the timing of the distributions. Contractual Obligations          The following table: summarizesour significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2007, and the future periods during which we expect to settle these obligations in cash, andreflectsthe timing of principal payments on outstanding borrowings.         Wehave provided additional details about some of these obligations in our notes to the financial statements:  Payments due in (millions)2008 2009-2010 2011-2012 2013 andbeyond Total Short- and long-term borrowings$252 $548 $607 $738 $2,145Interest expense on debt 126  224  158  834  1,342Operating leases 317  511  405  597  1,830Pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations (3) 207  428  566  1,610  2,811Purchase obligations (1) (2) 282  490  330  256  1,358Insurance premiums payable 9,468  27  3    9,498Policy and contract claims 35  41  17  21  114Other long-term liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheet under GAAP (4) 18  11  6  6  41Total-Continuing operations 10,705  2,280  2,092  4,062  19,139 Discontinued operations(5) 520  243  233  1,475  2,471Total Aon$11,225 $2,523 $2,325 $5,537 $21,610(1)Includedin purchase obligations are contracts for information technology outsourcing.

Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.             We are exposed to potential fluctuations in earnings, cash flows, and the fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates,foreign exchange rates, and equity prices. To manage the risk from these exposures, we enter into a variety of derivative instruments. We do not enter into derivatives or financial instruments fortrading purposes.         Thefollowing discussion describes our specific exposures and the strategies we use to manage these risks. See Notes 1 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for adiscussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments and derivatives.         Weare subject to foreign exchange rate risk from translating the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. Our primary exposures are to the British pound, theEuro, the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar. We use over-the-counter (OTC) options and forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on thetranslation of our foreign operations' financial statements.         Additionally,some of our foreign brokerage subsidiaries receive revenues in currencies that differ from their functional currencies. Our U.K. subsidiary earns approximately 28% of itsrevenue in U.S. dollars, but most of its expenses are incurred in pounds sterling. Our policy is to convert into pounds sterling sufficient U.S. dollar revenue to fund the subsidiary's pound sterlingexpenses using OTC options and forward exchange contracts. At December 31, 2007, we have hedged 60% and 48% of our U.K.subsidiaries' expected U.S. dollar transaction exposure for the years ending December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively. We do not generally hedge exposures beyond three years.         Thepotential loss in future earnings from market risk sensitive instruments resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in year-end exchange rates would not be materialin 2008 and 2009.         Ourbusinesses' income is affected by changes in international and domestic short-term interest rates. We monitor our net exposure to short-term interest ratesand as appropriate, hedge our exposure with various derivative financial instruments. A hypothetical, instantaneous parallel decrease in the period end yield curve of 100 basis points would cause adecrease, net of derivative positions, of $31 million to both 2008 and 2009 pretax income.         Thevaluation of our fixed-maturity investment portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. A hypothetical 1% (100 basis point) increase in long-term interest rates woulddecrease the fair value of the portfolio at December 31, 2007, and 2006 by approximately $3 million and $6 million, respectively. We have debt outstanding with a fair market valueof $2.2 billion and $2.6 billion at December 31, 2007, and 2006, respectively. This fair value was greater than the carrying value by $27 million and $318 million atDecember 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. A hypothetical 1% decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value by approximately 4% and 5% at December 31, 2007 and 2006,respectively. 62         PEPS I  At December 31, 2007, a 10% or 20% decrease in the underlying equity of the limited partnershipswould have decreased the value of the preferred stock securities by $15 million and $32 million, respectively.         Wehave selected hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity market prices to illustrate the possible impact of these changes; we are notpredicting market events. We believe these changes in rates and prices are reasonably possible within a one-year period. 63    Item 8.    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.     Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting          Management of Aon Corporation and its subsidiaries is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as definedin Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonableassurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.         Becauseof its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to futureperiods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.         Managementassessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007. In making this assessment, management used the criteriaset forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.         Basedon our assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007.         Theeffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered publicaccounting firm, as stated in their report on page 65. /s/  GREGORY C.

Aon Corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internalcontrol over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control overFinancial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.         Weconducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit toobtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal controlover financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, andperforming such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.         Acompany's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation offinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and proceduresthat (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) providereasonable assurance that transactions arerecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made onlyin accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, ordisposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.         Becauseof its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to futureperiods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.         Inour opinion, Aon Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the COSO criteria.         Wealso have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statements of financial position of AonCorporation as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period endedDecember 31, 2007 and our report dated February 27, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Chicago,IllinoisFebruary 27, 2008 65  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Financial Statements  Boardof Directors and StockholdersAon Corporation         Wehave audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Aon Corporation as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements ofincome, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index atItem 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedulebased on our audits.         Weconducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit toobtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures inthe financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statementpresentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.         Inour opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Aon Corporation at December 31, 2007and 2006, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally acceptedaccounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all materialrespects the information set forth therein.         Asdiscussed in Note 1, the Company changed its method of accounting for stock-based compensation and defined benefit pension and postretirement plans in 2006.         Wealso have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Aon Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as ofDecember 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report datedFebruary 27, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Consolidation          The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The consolidated financialstatements include the accounts of Aon Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries (""Aon"" or the ""Company""), excluding special-purpose entities (""SPEs"") considered variable interest entities(""VIEs"") for which Aon is not the primary beneficiary. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.         Thepreparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanyingnotes. Actual results could differ from the amounts reported.         Certainamounts in prior years' consolidated financial statements and footnotes related to discontinued operations have been reclassified to conform to the 2007 presentation. As a resultof the pending sale of the Company's CICA and Sterling subsidiaries, the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries have been reclassified to assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale,respectively. Due to the nature of operations, insurance underwriting organizations generally do not classify assets and liabilities on their statements of financial position as current andnoncurrent, and Aon had previously not reported a classified statement of financial position. Due to the pending sales of a majority of the underwritingoperations (see Note 5), at December 31, 2007 Aon has reported its statements of financial position on a classified basis. Segment Reporting          Aon classifies its businesses into two operating segments: Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services and Consulting. Unallocated income and expense, when combinedwith the operating segments and after the elimination of intersegment revenues, totals to the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements. Results relating to Aon's accident, health andlife operations, which were previously reported in a separate Insurance Underwriting segment, have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented. The remaining operations thatwere previously reported in the Insurance Underwriting segment, which relate to property and casualty insurance that is in runoff, are now included in unallocated income and expense for all periodspresented. Revenue Recognition          Revenue is recognized when all elements of revenue recognition exist. Those elements are (1) persuasive evidence of an agreement with the client,(2) a fixed and determinable price for services, (3) those services have been rendered, and (4) collectibility is reasonably assured. Commissions and Fees          Commission revenue is primarily recognized at the later of the billing or the effective date of the related insurance policy, net of an allowance for estimatedpolicy cancellations. The allowance is based on an evaluation of relevant historical data. Where all of the elements of revenue recognition have been met, but processing has not yet occurred in thebilling system due to timing, an accrual is recorded based on an analysis of the specific transactions. For policies that are billed in installments, revenue is recognized when Aon has sufficientinformation to estimate the amounts. When insurance underwriters directly bill clients, Aon's revenue is recognized when the cash is received or amounts due to Aon become determinable. Commissions onpremium adjustments are recognized as they occur. 72         Feesfor claims and consulting services are recognized when the services are rendered. For some clients, Aon has outsourcing arrangements that are spread over multiple years. Revenuesreceived from these arrangements are recorded on a gross basis, inclusive of amounts ultimately passed through to subcontractors, as long as Aon maintains the performance obligation, and are recordedratably over the life of the contract. Reinsurance          Reinsurance premiums, commissions and expense reimbursements on reinsured business are accounted for consistently with the accounting for the original policiesissued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts. Reinsurance receivables and prepaid reinsurance premium amounts are reported as assets. Income Taxes          Deferred income taxes are provided for the effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measuredusing the enacted marginal tax rates and laws that are currently in effect. Valuation allowances are recognized when, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that a net deferred taxasset may not be realized. Income Per Share          Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income available for common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Netincome available for common stockholders is net of all preferred stock dividends. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income available for common stockholders by theweighted-average number of common shares outstanding, plus the dilutive effect of stock options and awards. The dilutive effect of stock options and awards is calculated under the treasury stockmethod using the average market price for the period. Certain common stock equivalents related to options were not included in the computation of diluted income per share because those options'exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common shares. The number of options excluded from the calculation was 5 million in 2007, 8 million in 2006 and18 million in 2005. Aon includes in its diluted net income per share computation the impact of any contingently convertible instruments regardless of whether the market price trigger has beenmet. Prior to their redemption in November 2007, Aon's 3.5% convertible debt securities, which were issued in November 2002, were able to be converted into a maximum of 14 million shares of Aoncommon stock, and these shares were included in the computation of diluted net income per share (see Note 7 for further information). 73         Incomeper share is calculated as follows: (millions, except per share data) 2007 2006 2005  Income from continuing operations $672 $447 $416 Income from discontinued operations, net of tax  192  272  319 Cumulative effect of a change in accounting           Principle, net of tax    1      Net income  864  720  735 Preferred stock dividends      (2)   Net income for basic per share calculation  864  720  733 Interest expense on convertible debt securities,           net of tax  5  7  7  Net income for diluted per share calculation $869 $727 $740  Basic shares outstanding  298  317  322 Effect of convertible debt securities  11  14  14 Common stock equivalents  14  11  5  Diluted potential common shares  323  342  341  Basic net income per share:           Income from continuing operations $2.25 $1.41 $1.28  Discontinued operations  0.65  0.86  0.99  Cumulative effect of a change in accounting            principle, net of tax           Net income $2.90 $2.27 $2.27  Diluted net income per share:           Income from continuing operations $2.10 $1.33 $1.24  Discontinued operations  0.59  0.80  0.93  Cumulative effect of a change in accounting            principle, net of tax           Net income $2.69 $2.13 $2.17  Changes in Accounting Principles  Stock Compensation Plans          Prior to 2006, Aon was subject to Accounting Principles Board (""APB"") Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued toEmployees, in accounting for its stock-based compensation plans. Under APB No. 25, no compensation expense was recognized for stock options when the exercise price ofthe options equaled the market price of the stock at the date of grant. Compensation expense for stock awards was based on the market price at the date of the award and was recognized on astraight-line basis over the vesting period. Compensation expense for options with an exercise price less than the market price at the date of grant was based on the intrinsic value at thedate of grant.         OnJanuary 1, 2006, Aon adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-BasedPayment (""Statement No. 123(R)""), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payments to employees including grants ofemployee stock options and awards as well as employee stock purchases related to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, based on estimated fair value. Aon adopted Statement No. 123 (R) usingthe modified prospective transition method. In accordance with the modified prospective 74 transitionmethod, the Company's consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated for the adoption of Statement No. 123(R).         Stock-basedcompensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of stock-based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period.Stock-based compensation expense recognized in Aon's consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 includes compensation expense for stock-based paymentawards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of December 31, 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of Statement No. 123, andcompensation expense for stock-based payment awards granted subsequent to December 31, 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of StatementNo. 123(R). Because stock-based compensation expense recognized is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Statement No. 123(R)requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The adoption of StatementNo. 123(R) resulted in recording a cumulative effect of an accounting change as of January 1, 2006 of $1 million, net of tax, due to the requirement to adjust compensationrecognized through that date on restricted stock units (RSUs) to reflect forfeitures on an estimated method rather than the previous method, as they occurred. Upon adoption of StatementNo. 123(R), Aon also changedits method of valuation for stock options granted beginning in 2006 to a lattice-binomial option-pricing model from the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which was previously used for Aon's proforma information required under Statement No. 123. See Note 12 for further discussion of the effect of adopting Statement No. 123(R) on the Company's consolidated financialstatements. Pensions and Other Postretirement Plans          On December 31, 2006, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 158, Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension andOther Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). Statement No. 158 requires plansponsors of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans (collectively, ""postretirement benefit plans"") to recognize the funded status of their postretirement benefit plans in thestatement of financial position, measure the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the fiscal year-end statement of financial position, and provide additionaldisclosures. Adoption of the measurement date provisions of Statement No. 158 resulted in the Company changing the measurement date of its U.S. plans (previously November 30) and U.K.plans (previously September 30) to December 31. The impact of adopting Statement No. 158 was a decrease to stockholders' equity of $349 million and $33 million forthe funded status and measurement date provisions, respectively. See Note 11 for further discussion of the effect of adopting Statement No. 158 on the Company's consolidated financialstatements. Uncertain Tax Positions          Aon adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, aninterpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, on January 1, 2007. FIN 48 clarified the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes which are recognized in acompany's financial statements in accordance with Statement No. 109. FIN 48 prescribes recognition and measurement provisions for a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in acompany's tax return. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, Aon did not recognize any material adjustments in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 8 for furtherdiscussion of the effect of adopting FIN 48 on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Cash          Cash includes cash balances and investments with initial maturities of three months or less. 75 Short-term investments          Short-term investments include certificates of deposit, money market funds and highly liquid debt instruments purchased with maturities in excess ofthree months and up to one year and are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Short-term investments also include fixed maturity securities that mature within a year,and are reported at fair value based on quoted market prices.         Aonmaintained premium trust bank accounts for premiums collected from insureds but not yet remitted to insurance companies of $3.1 billion and $2.9 billion atDecember 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. These funds and a corresponding liability are included in short-term investments and insurance premiums payable, respectively, in theaccompanying consolidated statements of financial position. Receivables and Insurance Premiums Payable          In its capacity as an insurance agent and broker, Aon collects premiums from insureds and, after deducting its commission, remits the premiums to the respectiveinsurers. Aon also collects claims or refunds from insurers on behalf of insureds. Uncollected premiums from insureds and uncollected claims or refunds from insurers are recorded as receivables on theCompany's consolidated statements of financial position. Unremitted insurance premiums and claims are held in a fiduciary capacity. The obligation to remit these funds is recorded as insurancepremiums payable on the Company's consolidated statement of financial position. The time frame that the Company holds such funds is dependent upon the date the insured remits the payment of thepremium to Aon and the date Aon is required to forward those payments to the insurer. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts          Aon's policy for estimating allowances for doubtful accounts with respect to receivables is to record an allowance based on a historical evaluation ofwrite-offs, aging of balances and other qualitative and quantitative analyses. Total receivables included an allowance for doubtful accounts of $95 million and $89 million atDecember 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Property and Equipment          Property and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is generally calculated using the straight-line method overestimated useful lives. Included in this category is internal use software, which is software that is acquired, internally developed or modified solely to meet internal needs, with no plan to marketexternally. Costs related to directly obtaining, developing or upgrading internal use software are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over a range principally between3 to 7 years. The weighted-average original life of Aon's software at December 31, 2007 is 4.7 years. 76         Thecomponents of net property and equipment are as follows: (millions)    As of December 31 2007 2006Software $607 $583Leasehold improvements  412  374Furniture, fixtures and equipment  263  267Computer equipment  227  298Land and buildings  88  80Automobiles and aircraft  41  25Capital in progress  15  20     1,653  1,647Less: Accumulated depreciation  1,155  1,191Property and equipment, net $498 $456        Depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $154 million, $185 million and $205 million,respectively. Long-term Investments          Fixed-maturity securities are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value based on quotedmarket prices. The amortized cost of fixed maturity securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts to maturity, which are included in investment income.         Private equity investments are generally carried at cost, which the Company believes approximates fair value, except where Aon hassignificant influence, in which case they are carried using the equity method of accounting.         Unrealizedgains and losses on fixed maturity securities and marketable equity securities are excluded from income and are recorded directly in stockholders' equity as accumulated othercomprehensive income or loss, net of deferred income taxes.         Endurance common stock and warrants  Aon previously held investments in common stock and stock purchase warrants inEndurance Specialty Holdings, Ltd. (""Endurance""), a Bermuda-based insurance and reinsurance company. In 2004, Aon sold virtually all of its common stock investment in Endurance. In conjunctionwith the initial common stock investment, Aon also received 4.1 million stock purchase warrants, which allowed Aon to purchase additional Endurance common stock through December 2011. Thewarrants were recorded in the financial statements at fair value, with changes in fair value included in investment income. On March 31, 2006, Aon contributed all of the Endurance warrants toits U.K. pension plans. The change in the fair value was included in income and was a decrease of $14 million in 2006 and an increase of $8 million in 2005.         Limited partnership investments are carried using the equity method of accounting. Certain of the limited partnerships in which Aoninvests have holdings in publicly-traded equity securities. Changes in market value of these indirectly-held equity securities flow through the limited partnerships' financial statements.Aon's proportionate share of these valuation changes is included in unallocated income.         General  Income or loss on the disposal of investments is calculated using the amortized cost of the security sold andis reported in investment income in the consolidated statements of income.         Declinesin the fair value of investments are evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. The assessment of whether impairments haveoccurred is based on management's evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value. Management considers a wide range of factors and all relevant information about the securityissuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline and the prospects for recovery in the near-term. Impairment losses for declines 77 inthe value of investments which are attributable to issuer-specific events are evaluated on a case-by-case basis and recognized when the decline in fair value is judged to beother-than-temporary. For fixed-maturity investments with unrealized losses due to market conditions or industry-related events where Aon has the positive intent and ability tohold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow a market recovery or to maturity, declines in value below cost are considered to be temporary.         Reservesfor certain other investments are established based on an evaluation of the respective investment portfolio and current economic conditions. Write-downs and changes in reservesare included in investment income in the consolidated statements of income. In general, Aon ceases to accrue investment income when interest or dividend payments are in arrears.         Accountingpolicies relating to derivative financial instruments are discussed in Note 13. Fair Value of Financial Instruments          The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate fair values of financial instruments:         Cash and cash equivalents, including short-term investments:    Carrying amounts approximate fair value.         Fixed-maturity and equity securities:    Fair value is based on quoted market prices or on estimated values obtained fromindependent pricing services, if they are not actively traded.         Derivative financial instruments:    Fair value is based on quoted prices for exchange-traded instruments or the cost toterminate or offset with other contracts.         Other investments are comprised of Aon's investment in private equity investments and limited partnerships. Carrying amounts approximatefair value.         Debt:    Fair value is based on quoted market prices or estimates using discounted cash flow analyses based on current borrowingrates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. Policy and Contract Claims          Policy and contract claim liabilities represent estimates for reported claims, as well as provisions for losses incurred but not reported. Claim liabilities arebased on historical experience and are estimates of the ultimate amount to be paid when the claims are settled. The estimates are subject to the effects of trends in claim severity and frequency. Theprocess of estimating and establishing policy and contract liabilities is inherently uncertain and the actual ultimate cost of a claim may vary materially from the estimated amount reserved. Theestimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as necessary as experience develops or new information becomes known; such adjustments are included in current operations. Foreign Currency Translation          Foreign revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates. Foreign assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates. Netforeign exchange gains and losses on translation are reported in stockholders' equity, in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (""OCI""), net of applicable deferred income taxes. New Accounting Pronouncements          In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement 157, Fair Value Measurements, which provides enhanced guidance forusing fair value to measure assets and liabilities. Statement No. 157 also requires expanded disclosure of the methods employed when assets and liabilities are measured and the 78 effectof fair value measurements on earnings. Statement No. 157 applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. StatementNo. 157 does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. Statement No. 157 is effective for Aon in 2008. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159,  The Fair Value Option for FinancialAssets and Financial Liabilities, which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certainother items at fair value. Statement No. 159 is effective for Aon in 2008. The Company does not expect a material impact upon adoption of these Statements.         InDecember 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (""Statement No. 141(R)"") andStatement No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51. Statement No. 141(R)replaces Statement No. 141 and applies to all transactions or other events in which an entity obtains control over one or more businesses. This Statement requires an acquirer to recognize theassets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date. Business combinations achieved instages require recognition of the identifiable assets and liabilities, as well as the noncontroling interest in the acquiree, at the full amounts of their fair values. Statement No. 141(R) alsochanges the requirements for recognizing assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies, and requires direct acquisition costs to be expensed.         StatementNo. 160 amends ARB No. 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of asubsidiary. It clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements.This Statement also requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest. Statement No. 160requires retrospective adjustments, for all periods presented, of stockholders' equity and net income for noncontrolling interests.         BothStatements are effective for Aon as of January 1, 2009. Early adoption is prohibited. Aon is currently evaluating these Statements to determine what impact, if any, they willhave on its consolidated financial statements. 79  2.    Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)                                                                                           The components of other comprehensive income (loss) and the related tax effects are as follows: (millions)    Year ended December 31, 2007Pretax Income Tax(Expense)Benefit Netof Tax  Net derivative gains arising during the year$29 $(9)$20 Reclassification adjustment (16) 5  (11) Net change in derivative gains 13  (4) 9 Unrealized losses arising during the year (19) 9  (10)Reclassification adjustment 20  (7) 13  Net change in unrealized investment gains 1  2  3 Net foreign exchange translation 300  (134) 166 Net post-retirement benefit obligation 173  (67) 106  Total other comprehensive income$486 $(202)$284  (millions)    Year ended December 31, 2006Pretax Income Tax(Expense)Benefit Netof Tax  Net derivative gains arising during the year$31 $(12)$19 Reclassification adjustment 11  (4) 7  Net change in derivative gains 42  (16) 26 Unrealized gains arising during the year 10  (3) 7 Reclassification adjustment 19  (5) 14  Net change in unrealized investment gains 29  (8) 21 Net foreign exchange translation 238  (1) 237 Net additional minimum pension liability 321  (111) 210  Total other comprehensive income$630 $(136)$494  (millions)    Year ended December 31, 2005Pretax Income Tax(Expense)Benefit Netof Tax  Net derivative losses arising during the year$(20)$8 $(12)Reclassification adjustment (64) 25  (39) Net change in derivative losses (84) 33  (51)Unrealized losses arising during the year (8) 3  (5)Reclassification adjustment (8) 3  (5) Net change in unrealized investment losses (16) 6  (10)Net foreign exchange translation (248) 8  (240)Net additional minimum pension liability (253) 80  (173) Total other comprehensive loss$(601)$127 $(474) 80         The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of related tax, are as follows: (millions)    As of December 312007 2006 2005  Net derivative gains (losses)$24 $15 $(11)Net unrealized investment gains 76  73  52 Net foreign exchange translation 284  118  (119)Postretirement plans (1,110) (1,216) (1,077)  Accumulated other comprehensive loss$(726)$(1,010)$(1,155) 81 3.    Business Combinations                                                                                                       In 2007, 2006 and 2005, Aon completed a number of acquisitions, primarily related to its insurance brokerage operations. The following tableincludes the aggregate amounts paid and intangible assets recorded as a result of the acquisitions.

The 2007 Plan includes an estimated 2,700 job eliminations beginning in the third quarter of 2007 and continuing into 2009. The Company also expects to close or consolidateseveral offices resulting in sublease losses or lease buy-outs. The Company estimates that the 2007 Plan will result in cumulative pretax charges totaling approximately$360 million. Expenses will include workforce reduction and lease consolidation costs, asset impairments, as well as other expenses necessary to implement the restructuring initiative.

Also in 2007, Aon sold 25% of itsBotswana subsidiary, which is included in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment. A pretax gain of $4 million was recognized on the sale, which is included in other general expensesin the consolidated statements of income. These disposals did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations reporting. Discontinued Operations          In fourth quarter 2007, the Company announced that it had signed separate definitive agreements to sell its CICA and Sterling subsidiaries. These two subsidiarieswere previously included in the Insurance Underwriting segment. The CICA business is being sold to ACE Limited for cash consideration of $2.4 billion. Sterling is being sold to Munich Re Groupfor cash consideration of $352 million. Additionally, it is expected that CICA will pay a $325 million dividend to Aon before the sale transaction is completed. Both transactions areexpected to be completed in the second quarter of 2008. The dispositions are subject to various closing conditions, including receipt of certain required regulatory approvals.         In2006, Aon sold the following businesses: AonWarranty Group (""AWG"") and its worldwide warranty and credit operations, which was previously included in the Insurance Underwriting segment. A pretax gain of$16 million was recognized on the sale.ConstructionProgram Group (""CPG""), a managing general underwriter whose policies were underwritten by Aon's property and casualty operation. Results of CPG were previouslyincluded in both the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services and Insurance Underwriting segments. A pretax gain of $27 million was recognized on the sale.         Goodwillwas allocated to these businesses based on their estimated fair value compared to the fair value of the reporting units in which they were previously included.         In2005, Aon sold Swett & Crawford (""Swett""), its U.S.-based wholesale insurance brokerage unit. Previously, Swett was included in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Servicessegment. The sale resulted in a pretax gain of $239 million. A&A Discontinued Operations          Prior to its acquisition by Aon, Alexander & Alexander Services, Inc. (""A&A"") discontinued its property and casualty insurance underwriting operations in 1985,some of which were then placed into runoff, with the remainder sold in 1987. In connection with those sales, A&A provided indemnities to the purchaser for various estimated and potential liabilities,including provisions to cover future losses attributable to insurance pooling arrangements, a stop-loss reinsurance agreement and actions or omissions by various underwriting agenciespreviously managed by an A&A subsidiary.         Asof December 31, 2007 and 2006, the liabilities associated with the foregoing indemnities were included in other non-current liabilities in the consolidatedstatements of financial position. Such liabilities amounted to $69 million and $81 million, respectively. Reinsurance recoverables and other assets related to these liabilities are$87 million and $94 million, respectively. The remaining insurance liabilities represent estimates of known and future claims expected to be settled over the next 20 to 30 years,principally with regards to asbestos, pollution and other health exposures. Although these 85 insuranceliabilities represent a best estimate of the probable liabilities, adverse developments may occur given the nature of the information available and the variables inherent in the estimationprocesses. In 2006, an agreement was reached relating to the settlement of certain legacy reinsurance claims, which resulted in a pretax gain, net of expenses, of $13 million. In 2005, a pretaxexpense of $11 million was recorded for consulting and legal costs related to completed and contemplated settlements and actuarial refinements to claims reserves and reinsurance recoverables.         Theoperating results of all these businesses are classified as discontinued operations, and prior years' operating results have been reclassified to discontinued operations, as follows.

Aon's continuing operations haveno fixed maturities with an unrealized loss at December 31, 2007. Aon's fixed-maturity portfolio is subject to interest rate, market and credit risks. With a carrying value of approximately$150 million at December 31, 2007, Aon's total fixed-maturity portfolio is approximately 96% investment grade based on market value. Aon's non publicly-traded fixed maturity portfoliohad a carrying value of $9 million. Valuations of these securities primarily reflect the fundamental analysis of the issuer and current market price of comparable securities.         Aon'sequity portfolio is comprised of a preferred stock not publicly traded. This portfolio is subject to interest rate, market, credit, illiquidity, concentration and operationalperformance risks.         Limited Partnership Securitization.    In 2001, Aon sold the vast majority of its limited partnership(LP) portfolio, valued at $450 million, to PEPS I, a QSPE. The common stock interest in PEPS I is held by a limited liability company which is owned by Aon (49%) and by acharitable trust, which is not controlled by Aon, established for victims of September 11 (51%). Approximately $171 million of investment grade fixed-maturity securities were sold byPEPS I to unaffiliated third parties. PEPS I then paid Aon's insurance underwriting subsidiaries the $171 million in cash and issued to them an additional $279 million infixed-maturity and preferred stock securities.         Aspart of this transaction, Aon is required to purchase from PEPS I additional fixed-maturity securities in an amount equal to the unfunded limited partnership commitments, asthey are requested. Aon funded $2 million of commitments in both 2007 and 2006. As of December 31, 2007, these unfunded commitments amounted to $44 million. These commitments havespecific expiration dates and the general partners may decide not to draw on these commitments. The carrying value of the PEPS I preferred stock was $168 million and $210 millionat December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.         Priorto 2007, income distributions received from PEPS I were limited to interest payments on various PEPS I debt instruments. Beginning in 2007, PEPS I had redeemedor collateralized all of its debt, and as a result, began to pay preferred income distributions. In 2007, the Company received $61 million of income distributions from PEPS I, which areincluded in investment income. 89         Thecomponents of investment income are as follows: (millions)    Years ended December 312007 2006 2005  Short-term investments$228 $193 $129  Fixed maturities:          Interest income 8  11  10  Losses (1)   (2)      Total 8  9  10  Other investments:          Interest, dividend and other income 61    6  Endurance  warrants   (14) 8  Net gains (losses) (1) 12  38  (3)    Total 73  24  11  Gross investment income 309  226  150 Less: investment expenses 8  5  6  Investment income$301 $221 $144  (1)Includesother-than-temporary impairment write-downs of $2 million, $1 million and $3 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.         Thecomponents of net unrealized investment gains (losses), which include investments reported as held-for-sale, are as follows: (millions)    As of December 312007 2006 2005  Fixed maturities$(31)$(49)$(39)Equity securities (4) (4) (1)Other investments 150  167  125 Deferred taxes (39) (41) (33) Net unrealized investment gains$76 $73 $52          The pretax changes in net unrealized investment gains (losses), which include investments reported as held-for-sale, are as follows: (millions)    Years ended December 312007 2006 2005  Fixed maturities$18 $(10)$(51)Equity securities   (3) (2)Other investments (17) 42  37  Total$1 $29 $(16) Other          Securities on deposit with insurance regulatory authorities related to the Company's runoff property and casualty operations amounted to $5 million atDecember 31, 2007.         AtDecember 31, 2007 and 2006, Aon had $66 million and $214 million, respectively, of non-income producing investments, which excludes derivatives thatare marked tomarket through the income statement, as well as private equity investments carried on the equity method, held for at least twelve months, that have not declared dividends during 2007 and 2006. 90  7.    Debt and Lease Commitments                                                                                          Debt          The following is a summary of outstanding debt: (millions)    As of December 31 2007 20068.205% junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures, due January 2027 $726 $7265.05% debt securities, due April 2011  382  3237.375% debt securities, due December 2012  224  2243.5% convertible debt securities, due November 2012    2976.2% debt securities, due January 2007    250Euro credit facility  795  403Notes payable, due in varying installments, with interest at        1% to 15.9%  16  20Other  2  42Total debt  2,145  2,285 Less short-term debt  252  42Total long-term debt $1,893 $2,243        Aon created Aon Capital A, a wholly-owned statutory business trust, for the purpose of issuing mandatorily redeemable preferred capital securities(""Capital Securities"").

The interest rate on these debt securities was subject to adjustment in the event that Aon's creditratings change. Due to a rating downgrade in 2004, the interest rate on the 6.2% debt securities was increased to 6.95% effective January 2005. These securities were redeemed in January 2007.         InNovember 2007, the Company redeemed all of its remaining outstanding 31/2% Senior Convertible Debentures that were due in 2012. All of the holders of the Debentureselected to convert their debentures into Aon common stock at a conversion rate of 46.5658 shares of common stock for each $1,000 principal amount of Debentures.

Although future earnings cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the realization of the net deferred tax asset is more likely than not.         Aonrecognized, as an adjustment to additional paid-in-capital, income tax benefits attributable to employee stock compensation as follows:2007  $34 million; 2006  $21 million; and 2005  $5 million.         U.S.deferred income taxes are not provided on unremitted foreign earnings that are considered permanently reinvested, which at December 31, 2007 amounted to approximately$1.7 billion. It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if all such earnings were remitted to the U.S. due to foreign tax credits and exclusions thatmay become available at the time of remittance.         AtDecember 31, 2007, Aon had domestic federal operating loss carryforwards of $13 million that will expire at various dates from 2008 to 2022, state operating losscarryforwards of $526 million that will expire at various dates from 2008 to 2026, and foreign operating and capital loss carryforwards of $395 million and $76 million,respectively, nearly all of which are subject to indefinite carryforward.         Theamount of income taxes paid in 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $121 million, $431 million and $197 million, respectively. Uncertain Tax Provisions          As described in Note 1, the Company adopted FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. The effect of adopting FIN 48 was not material to the Company'sfinancial statements. 94         Thefollowing is a reconciliation of the Company's beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits (in millions). Balance at January 1, 2007 $53 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year  4 Additions for tax positions of prior years  24 Reductions for tax positions of prior years  (6)Settlements  (5) Balance at December 31, 2007 $70          Of the amount included in the previous table, $57 million of unrecognized tax benefits would impact the effective tax rate if recognized. Aon does notexpect the unrecognized tax positions to change significantly over the next twelve months.         TheCompany recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized income tax benefits in its provision for income taxes. Aon accrued potential penalties and interest of less than$1 million related to unrecognized tax positions during 2007. In total, as of December 31, 2007, Aon has recorded a liability for penalties and interest of $1 million and$7 million, respectively.         Aonand its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction as well as various state and international jurisdictions. Aon has substantially concluded all U.S.federal income tax matters for years through 2004. The Internal Revenue Service commenced an examination of Aon's federal U.S. income tax returns for 2005 and 2006 in the fourth quarter of 2007.Material U.S. state and local income tax jurisdiction examinations have been concluded for years through 2002. Aon has concluded income tax examinations in its primary international jurisdictionsthrough 2000. 95 9.    Reinsurance and Claim Reserves                                                                                              Aon's insurance subsidiaries both cede and assume reinsurance under reinsurance agreements. Aon's reinsurance consists primarily of certainproperty and casualty lines that are in runoff. Aon's insurance subsidiaries remain liable to the extent that the reinsurers are unable to meet their obligations. As of November 30, 2006, inconnection with the sale of AWG, Aon sold Virginia Surety Company (""VSC""). VSC will continue to remain liable to policyholders to the extent reinsurers of the property and casualty business do notmeet their obligations. Aon has issued an indemnification which protects the purchaser from credit exposure related to the property and casualty reserves that have been reinsured. Aon has provided acorporate guarantee with respect to these reinsurance recoverables. These reinsurance recoverables amount to $846 million at December 31, 2007.         Asummary of reinsurance activity in continuing operations is as follows: (millions)    Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005Ceded premiums earned $1 $1 $1Ceded premiums written    12  2Assumed premiums earned  3  28  57Assumed premiums written  3  25  49Ceded benefits to policyholders  1            Activity in the liability for policy and contract claims is summarized as follows: (millions)    Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005Liabilities at beginning of year $149 $222 $275Incurred losses:          Current year  1  16  20 Prior years  7  81  30  Total  8  97  50Payment of claims:          Current year    15  7 Prior years  43  155  96  Total  43  170  103Liabilities at end of year $114 $149 $222        In 2006, in connection with the sales of AWG and CPG, Aon completed a detailed review of all its property and casualty reserves. Based on the results of thisreview, the Company increased its property and casualty reserves by approximately $102 million, reflecting adverse development, refined assumptions and additional claim information relating toprograms to be disposed of through sale or runoff. Aon recorded $81 million of this adjustment in continuing operations in other general expenses in the consolidated statement of income. Theremaining $21 million is not included in the preceding table because it relates to CPG and is recorded in discontinued operations. Of the $81 million recorded in continuing operations,the majority related to National Program Services, an independent managing general underwriter that wrote habitational risk on behalf of Aon. 96 10.  Stockholders' Equity                                                                                               Common Stock          In November 2005, Aon's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of Aon's common stock. In November 2006, the Board increased thatamount to $2 billion. In December 2007, the Board increased the authorization amount to $4.6 billion. Shares may be repurchased through the open market or in privately negotiatedtransactions from time to time, based on prevailing market conditions, and will be funded from available capital. Any repurchased shares will be available for employee stock plans and for othercorporate purposes. In 2007, the Company repurchased 19.1 million shares at a cost of $751 million. In 2006, the Company repurchased 28.4 million shares at a cost of$1,048 million. Aon repurchased 0.7 million shares at a cost of $25 million in 2005. In 2008 through February 27, the Company has repurchased 6.7 million shares at acost of $286 million.         Inconnection with the acquisition of two entities controlled by Aon's then-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in 2001, Aon obtained approximately 22.4 millionshares of its common stock. These treasury shares are restricted as to their reissuance.         In2007, Aon issued 0.4 million new shares of common stock for employee benefit plans and 0.1 million shares in connection with employee stock purchase plans. In addition,Aon reissued 9.3 million shares of treasury stock for employee benefit programs and 0.3 million shares in connection with employee stock purchase plans.         InNovember 2007, the Company redeemed all of its remaining outstanding 31/2% Senior Convertible Debentures that were due in 2012. All of the holders of the Debentureselected to convert their debentures into Aon common stock at a conversion rate of 46.5658 shares of common stock for each $1,000 principal amount of Debentures. As a result of this redemption andearlier voluntary redemptions, approximately 14 million shares of Aon common stock were issued in 2007. Dividends          A summary of dividends paid is as follows: (millions)    Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005Redeemable preferred stock $ $ $2Common stock  176  189  191Total dividends paid $176 $189 $193        Dividends paid per common share were $0.60 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Statutory Capital and Dividend Restrictions          State insurance laws and regulations prescribe accounting practices for determining statutory capital and surplus and net income for insurance companies andrequire, among other matters, the filing of financial statements prepared in accordance with statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted for insurance companies. State insurance laws andregulations in the U.S. also require the maintenance of a minimum capital and surplus based on various factors. At December 31, 2007, the Company's insurance subsidiaries were in compliancewith these minimum requirements. Statutory capital and surplus of the insurance subsidiaries were $971 million and $870 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.Statutory net income of the insurance subsidiaries were $259 million, $206 million and $159 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 97         Dividendspaid by the Company's insurance subsidiaries are limited by state insurance regulations. The insurance regulator in each state of domicile may disapprove any dividend that,together with other dividends paid by a subsidiary in the prior twelve months, exceeds the regulatory maximum as computed for the subsidiary based on its statutory capital and surplus and net income.As a result, the capital and surplus of the subsidiaries available for transfer to the parent company are limited. As of December 31, 2007, payments of dividend amounts in excess of$273 million may be subject to approval by regulatory authorities.         Inaddition to compliance requirements of state insurance laws and regulations in the U.S., the Company has foreign subsidiaries and branches that are required to meet various regulatoryrequirements in their respective jurisdictions. 98  11.  Employee Benefits                                                                                                  Defined Contribution Savings Plans          Aon subsidiaries maintain defined contribution savings plans for the benefit of its U.S. and U.K. employees. The expense recognized for these plans, which isincluded in compensation and benefits and discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income, is as follows (in millions):  2007 2006 2005U.S.$49 $49 $47U.K. 37  19  20 $86 $68 $67Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefits          Aon sponsors defined benefit pension and post-retirement health and welfare plans that provide retirement, medical and life insurance benefits. Thepost-retirement healthcare plans are contributory, with retiree contributions adjusted annually; the life insurance and pension plans are noncontributory.         EffectiveJanuary 1, 2007, future benefits in the Company's U.S. defined benefit pension plan are calculated based on a ""career average pay"" formula instead of a ""final averagepay"" formula. The change affected approximately 11,000 active employees covered by the U.S. plan. Effective March 31, 2007, the Company ceased crediting future benefits relating to salary andservice in its U.K. defined benefit pension plans. The change affected approximately 1,700 active employees covered by the U.K. plans. Adoption of Statement No. 158          On December 31, 2006, Aon adopted the recognition, disclosure and measurement date provisions of Statement No. 158. This Statement required Aon torecognize the funded status of its post-retirement benefit plans in the December 31, 2006 statement of financial position, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated othercomprehensive loss, net of tax. The adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss at adoption represents net unrecognized actuarial losses and unrecognized prior service costs which werepreviously netted against the plan's funded status in Aon's statement of financial position pursuant to the provisions of Statement No. 87. These amounts will be subsequently recognized as netperiodic benefit cost pursuant to Aon's historical accounting policy for amortizing such amounts. Further, actuarial gains and losses that arise in subsequent periods and are not recognized as netperiodic benefit cost in the same periods will be recognized as a component of other comprehensive income. Those amounts will be subsequently recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost onthe same basis as the amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss at adoption of Statement No. 158. 99         Theincremental effects of adopting the provisions of Statement No. 158 on Aon's statement of financial position at December 31, 2006 are presented in the following table.Had Aon not been required to adopt Statement No. 158 at December 31, 2006, it would have recognized an additional minimum liability pursuant to the provisions of Statement No. 87.The effect of recognizing the additional minimum liability is included in the table below in the column labeled ""Prior to Adopting of Statement No. 158.""  At December 31, 2006   (millions)Prior toAdoptingStatementNo. 158 Effect ofAdoptingStatementNo. 158 As Reported atDecember 31,2006  Intangible pension asset and prepaid pension asset (included in other non-current assets)$1,009 $(146)$863 Accrued pension and other benefit liabilities (included in pension, post-employment and post-retirement liabilities) (1,108) (357) (1,465)Deferred income taxes 473  154  627 Accumulated other comprehensive loss 661  349  1,010  100 Pension Plans          The following tables provide a reconciliation of the changes in the benefit obligations and fair value of assets for the years ended December 31, 2007 and2006 and a statement of the funded status as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, for the U.S. plans and material international plans, which are located in the U.K., the Netherlands and Canada.

Investment Policy and Strategy          The U.S. investment policy, as established by the Aon Pension Plan Investment Committee, seeks reasonable asset growth at prudent risk levels within targetallocations. Aon believes that plan assets are well-diversified and are of appropriate quality. The investment portfolio asset allocation is reviewed quarterly and re-balancedto within policy target allocations. The investment policy is reviewed at least annually and revised, as deemed appropriate by the Aon Pension Plan Investment Committee. The investment policies forinternational plans are established by the local pension plan trustees and seek to maintain the plans' ability to meet liabilities and to comply with local minimum funding requirements. Plan assetsare invested, within asset allocation ranges as shown above, in diversified portfolios that provide adequate levels of return at an acceptable level of risk. The investment policies are reviewed atleast annually and revised, as deemed appropriate to ensure that the objectives are being met. Cash Flows  Contributions          Based on current assumptions, Aon expects to contribute $8 million and $187 million, respectively, to its U.S. and international pension plansduring 2008 to satisfy minimum funding requirements. 104 Estimated Future Benefit Payments          Estimated future benefit payments for plans are as follows at December 31, 2007: (millions)U.S. International2008$74 $1572009 77  1662010 82  1752011 86  1842012 90  1972013  2017 536  1,153U.S. Other Post-Retirement Benefits          The following table provides an overview of the accumulated projected benefit obligation, fair value of plan assets, funded status and net amount recognized as ofDecember 31, 2007 and 2006 for the Company's other post-retirement benefit plan (in millions).  2007 2006  Accumulated projected benefit obligation$(56)$(76)Fair value of plan assets 8  8 Funded status (48) (68)Net amount recognized (78) (82)         The net periodic benefit cost recognized for the Company's other post-retirement benefit plans was $1 million, $5 million, and$6 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income that have not yet been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost atDecember 31, 2007 are $5 million and $25 million of net gain and prior service credit, respectively. The amount in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognizedas a component of net periodic benefit cost during 2008 is $4 million of prior service credit.         Theweighted-average discount rate used to determine future benefit obligations was 6.29%, 5.85%, and 5.75% for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The weighted-average discount rateused to determine net periodic benefit cost was 5.85%, 5.75%, and 6.0% for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.         Basedon current assumptions, Aon expects: Tocontribute $6 million to fund other post-retirement benefit plans during 2008.Estimatedfuture pension benefit payments will be approximately $5 million each year for the years 2008-2012 and $20 million in aggregate for2013-2017.         Aon'sliability for future plan cost increases for pre-65 and Medical Supplement plan coverage is limited to 5% per annum. Because of this cap, net employer trend rates forthese plans are effectively limited to 5% per year in the future. During 2007, Aon recognized a plan amendment which phases out post-65 retiree coverage over the next three years. As aresult, a 1% change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates has no effect on the service and interest cost components of net periodic post-retirement healthcare benefit cost or on theaccumulated post-retirement benefit obligation for the measurement period ended in 2007. 105 12.  Stock Compensation Plans                                                                                                   Aon's Stock Incentive Plan (as amended and restated) (the ""Plan"") provides for the grant of non-qualified and incentive stock options,stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units (""RSUs""). The annual rate at which awards are granted each year is based upon financial and competitive business conditions. Thenumber of shares authorized to be issued under the plan is equal to 18% of the number of common shares outstanding. Compensation expense          Stock based compensation expense recognized during 2007 and 2006, which includes RSUs, stock options, performance plan awards and stock purchases related to theEmployee Stock Purchase Plan, are based on the value of the portion of stock-based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period. Stock-based compensation expense recognized inAon's consolidated statements of income for 2007 and 2006 includes compensation expense for stock-based payment awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of December 31, 2005 based on thegrant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of Statement No. 123, and compensation expense for the stock-based payment awards granted subsequent toDecember 31, 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of Statement No. 123(R). Because stock-based compensation expense recognized is based onawards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeituresdiffer from those estimates.         Thefollowing table summarizes stock-based compensation expense related to all stock-based payments recognized in continuing operations in the consolidated statements of income incompensation and benefits.

Prior to 2006, RSUs granted to employees were service-based.Beginning with awards granted in 2006, awards to employees may consist of performance-based RSUs and service-based RSUs. Service-based awards generally vest between five and ten years from the date ofgrant. For most employees, individual incentive compensation over $50,000 is partially paid in RSUs, which vest ratably over threeyears. Stock awards are issued as they vest. In years prior to 2006, in certain circumstances, an employee was able to elect to defer the receipt of vested shares to a later date. With certain limitedexceptions, any break in continuous employment will cause forfeiture of all unvested awards. The compensation cost associated with each stock award is amortized over the service period using thestraight-line method. Dividend equivalents are paid on certain service-based RSUs, based on the initial grant amount. At December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the number of sharesavailable for stock awards is included with options available for grant.         In2007 and 2006, performance-based RSUs were granted to certain executives and key employees, whose vesting is contingent upon meeting various individual, divisional orcompany-wide performance conditions, including revenue generation or growth in revenue, pretax income or earnings per share over a one- to five-year period. Theperformance condition is not considered in the determination of grant date fair value of these awards. Compensation cost is recognized over the performance period, and in certain cases an additionalvesting period, based on management's estimate of the number of units expected to vest. Compensation cost will be adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares paid out at the end of the programs.The payout of shares under these performance-based plans may range 107 from0-200% of the number of units granted, based on the plan. Dividend equivalents are generally not paid on the performance-based RSUs.         Informationregarding Aon's performance-based plans as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 follows: (shares in thousands, dollars in millions)2007 2006Potential RSUs to be issued based on current performance levels 4,860  2,560Shares forfeited during the year 109  49RSUs awarded during the year 9  30Unamortized expense, based on current performance levels$92 $71        A summary of the status of Aon's non-vested stock awards is as follows: Years ended December 312007 2006 2005(shares in thousands)Shares FairValue Shares FairValue Shares IntrinsicValueNon-vested at beginning of year12,870 $28 11,641 $25 8,738 $28Granted4,270  39 3,646  37 4,727  24Vested(2,158) 28 (1,809) 25 (1,145) 28Forfeited(832) 34 (608) 27 (679) 29Non-vested at end of year14,150 $31 12,870 $28 11,641 $26Stock Options          Options to purchase common stock are granted to certain executives and key employees of Aon and its subsidiaries generally at 100% of market value on the date ofgrant. Generally, employees are required to complete two continuous years of service before the options begin to vest in increments until the completion of a 4-year period of continuousemployment, although a number of options were granted that require five continuous years of service before all options would vest. The maximum contractual term on stock options is generally ten yearsfrom the date of grant.         Uponadoption of Statement No. 123(R), Aon changed its method of valuation for stock options granted beginning in 2006 to a lattice-binomial option-pricing model from theBlack-Scholes option-pricing model, which was previously used for Aon's pro forma information required under Statement No. 123. Lattice-based option valuation models utilize a range ofassumptions over the expected term of the options. Expected volatilities are based on the average of the historical volatility of Aon's stock price and the implied volatility of traded options andAon's stock. Aon uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee terminations within the valuation model, stratifying between executives and key employees. The expected dividend yieldassumption is based on the Company's historical and expected future dividend rate. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasuryyield curve in effect at the time of grant. 108         Thefollowing weighted average assumptions were used to estimate fair value.

At December 31, 2007, the aggregateintrinsic value of options outstanding was $449 million, of which $249 million was exercisable.         Theaggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $83 million, $45 million and $20 million, respectively.         Unamortizeddeferred compensation expense, which includes both options and awards, amounted to $321 million as of December 31, 2007, with a remaining weighted-averageamortization period of approximately 2.2 years.         Cashreceived from the exercise of stock options was $230 million, $121 million, and $63 million during 2007, 2006, 2005, respectively. The tax benefit realized fromstock options exercised was $29 million, $14 million and $3 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.         During2007, a majority of option exercises and award vestings were satisfied through the reissuance of treasury shares. Employee Stock Purchase Plan  United States          Aon has an employee stock purchase plan that provides for the purchase of a maximum of 7.5 million shares of Aon's common stock by eligible U.S. employees.Under the plan, shares of Aon's common stock may be purchased at 3-month intervals at 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the first or the last day of each3-month period. In 2007, 2006, and 2005, 405,000 shares, 457,000 shares and 697,000 shares, respectively, were issued to employees under the plan. Compensation expenserecognized was approximately $3 million in both 2007 and 2006. There was no compensation expense associated with this plan in 2005. United Kingdom          Aon also has an employee stock purchase plan that for 2006, provided for the purchase of a maximum of 525,000 shares of Aon common stock by eligible U.K.employees after a 3-year period and which is similar to the U.S. plan described above. The number of shares eligible for purchase is approved by Aon's Board of Directors on a yearly basisand for 2007 no opportunity for purchase occurred. In 2007, less than 1,000 shares were issued under the plan. No shares were issued under the plan in 2006 or 2005. In 2007 and 2006,compensation expense recognized was less than $1 million each year. There was no compensation expense associated with this plan in 2005. 110  13.  Financial Instruments                                                                                              Financial Risk Management          Aon is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity security prices. To manage the risk related to theseexposures, Aon enters into various derivative transactions. The derivatives have the effect of reducing Aon's market risks by creating offsetting market exposures. Aon does not enter into derivativetransactions for trading purposes.         Derivativetransactions are governed by a uniform set of policies and procedures covering areas such as authorization, counterparty exposure and hedging practices. Positions aremonitored using techniques such as market value and sensitivity analyses.         Certainderivatives also give rise to credit risks from the possible non-performance by counterparties. The credit risk is generally limited to the fair value of thosecontracts that are favorable to Aon. Aon has limited its credit risk by using master netting agreements, entering into non-exchange-traded derivatives with highly rated major financialinstitutions and by using exchange-traded instruments. Aon closely monitors the credit-worthiness of, and exposure to, its counterparties. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, Aon placed cash andsecurities relating to these derivative contracts in escrow amounting to $5 million and $9 million, respectively. Accounting Policy for Derivative Instruments          All derivative instruments are recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position at fair value. Unless otherwise noted, derivative instruments witha positive fair value are reported inreceivables and derivative instruments with a negative fair value are reported in other current liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position. Where Aon has entered into masternetting agreements with counterparties, the derivative positions are netted by program and are reported accordingly in receivables or other current liabilities. Changes in the fair value of derivativeinstruments are recognized immediately in earnings, unless the derivative is designated as a hedge and qualifies for hedge accounting.         FASBStatement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, identifies three hedging relationships wherea derivative (hedging instrument) may qualify for hedge accounting: (i) a hedge of the change in fair value of a recognized asset or liability or firm commitment (""fair value hedge""),(ii) a hedge of the variability in cash flows from a recognized variable-rate asset or liability or forecasted transaction (""cash flow hedge""), and (iii) a hedge of the netinvestment in a foreign subsidiary (""net investment hedge""). Under hedge accounting, recognition of derivative gains and losses can be matched in the same period with that of the hedged exposure andthereby minimize earnings volatility.         Inorder for a derivative to qualify for hedge accounting, the derivative must be formally designated as a fair value, cash flow, or a net investment hedge by documenting therelationship between the derivative and the hedged item. The documentation will include a description of the hedging instrument, the hedge item, the risk being hedged, Aon's risk management objectiveand strategy for undertaking the hedge, the method for assessing the effectiveness of the hedge, and the method for measuring hedge ineffectiveness. Additionally, the hedge relationship must beexpected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item at both inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis. Aon assesses the ongoingeffectiveness of its hedges and measures and records hedge ineffectiveness at the end of each quarter.         Fora fair value hedge, the change in fair value of the hedging instrument and the change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged are both recognizedcurrently in earnings. Aon did not enter into any fair value hedges in 2007. For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in fair value of a hedging instrument is recognized in OCI andsubsequently 111 reclassifiedto income when the hedged item affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a cash flow hedge is recognized immediately in earnings. For a net investmenthedge, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the hedging instrument is reported in OCI as part of the cumulative translation adjustment, while the ineffective portion is recognizedimmediately in earnings.         Changesin the fair value of a derivative that is not designated as an accounting hedge (known as an ""economic hedge"") are recorded in either investment income or other general expenses(depending on the hedged exposure) in the current period's consolidated statement of income.         Aondiscontinues hedge accounting prospectively when (1) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, (2) it determines that the derivative is no longereffective in offsetting changes in the hedged item's fair value or cash flows, (3) a hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring in the time period described in the hedgedocumentation, (4) the hedged item matures or is sold, or (5) management elects to discontinue hedge accounting voluntarily.         Whenhedge accounting is discontinued because the derivative no longer qualifies as a fair value hedge, Aon will continue to carry the derivative in the consolidated statements offinancial position at its fair value, recognize subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative in current-period earnings, cease to adjust the hedged asset or liability for changes in its fairvalue, and begin to amortize the hedged item's cumulative basis adjustment into earnings over the remaining life of the hedged item using a method that approximates the level-yield method.         Whenhedge accounting is discontinued because the derivative no longer qualifies as a cash flow hedge, Aon will continue to carry the derivative in the consolidated statements offinancial position at its fair value, recognize subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative in current-period earnings, and continue to defer the derivative gain or loss in accumulated OCIuntil the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. If the hedged forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring in the time period described in the hedge documentation or within a twomonth period of time thereafter, the deferred derivative gain or loss would be reclassified immediately to earnings. Foreign Exchange Risk Management          Certain of Aon's foreign brokerage subsidiaries, primarily in the U.K., receive revenues in currencies (primarily in U.S. dollars) that differ from theirfunctional currencies. The foreign subsidiary's functional currency revenue will fluctuate as the currency exchange rates change. To reduce this variability, Aon uses foreign exchange forwards andover-the-counter options to hedge the foreign exchange risk of the forecasted revenue for up to a maximum of three years in the future. Aon has designated these derivatives ascash flow hedges of its forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue. As of December 31, 2007, a $9 million pretax gain has been deferred to OCI, $10 million of which isexpected to be reclassified to earnings as an adjustment to other general expenses in 2008. Deferred gains or losses will be reclassified from OCI to other general expenses when the hedged revenue isrecognized. The hedge had no material ineffectiveness in either 2007 or 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company recognized immaterial losses on cash flow hedges that werediscontinued due to forecast revisions. Aon also uses forward contracts, which have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes, to hedge economic risks that arise from fluctuations in thecurrency exchange rates. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in other general expenses in the consolidated statements of income.         Aonuses over-the-counter basket options to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the translation of the financial statements of Aon's foreignoperations. These derivatives are not eligible for hedge accounting treatment and changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in other general expenses in the consolidated statementsof income. 112         Aonalso uses foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange risk associated with foreign denominated (primarily British pounds) intercompany notes. These derivatives werenot designated as a hedge because changes in their fair value were largely offset in earnings by remeasuring the notes for changes in spot exchange rates. Changes in the fair value of thesederivatives were recorded in other general expenses in the consolidated statements of income.         Aonalso uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain of its net investments in foreign underwriting operations (primarily Canadian dollar, Euro and British pound). During2007 and 2006, this hedge had no ineffectiveness, and a $26 million and $24 million cumulative pretax loss has been included in OCI at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.         In2005, Aon subsidiaries entered into cross-currency swaps to hedge the foreign currency risks associated with foreign denominated fixed-rate term intercompany borrowings.These swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2007, an $8 million pretax gain had been deferred to OCI, of which a $2 million pretax loss is expected tobe reclassified to earnings in 2008 as an adjustment to interest expense. The reclassification from OCI will offset the related transaction gain or loss arising from the remeasurement of the borrowingdue to changes in spot exchange rates and to record interest income at the interest rate implicit in the derivative. This hedge had no material ineffectiveness in 2007 or 2006.         Severalof Aon's subsidiaries have negotiated outsourcing service agreements in currencies that differ from their functional currencies; primarily the Philippine Peso and the IndianRupee. The subsidiary's functional currency expense will fluctuate as the currency exchange rates change. To reduce this variability, Aon uses foreign exchange forwards to hedge the foreign exchangerisk of the forecasted expense for the life of the contract or up to six years. Aon has designated these derivatives as cash flow hedges of its forecasted foreign currency denominated expense. As ofDecember 31, 2007, a $3 million pretax gain has been deferred to OCI, $1 million of which is expected to be reclassified to earnings as an adjustment to other general expenses in2008. Deferred gains or losses will be reclassified from OCI to other general expenses when the hedged revenue is recognized. The hedge did not have any ineffectiveness in 2007. Interest Rate Risk Management          Aon enters into receive-fixed-pay-floating interest rate swaps which are designated as cash flow hedges of the interest rate risk of aportion of Aon's U.S. dollar and Eurodenominated brokerage funds held on behalf of U.S., European, and U.K. clients and other U.S., European, and U.K. operating funds. Forecasted deposit balances are hedged up to a maximum of three yearsinto the future. Changes in the fair value of the swaps are recorded in OCI and will be reclassified to earnings as an adjustment to investment income over the term of the swap. As ofDecember 31, 2007, a $16 million pretax gain related to this hedge was recorded in OCI, $2 million of which is expected to be reclassified to investment income in 2008. This hedgehad no material ineffectiveness in 2007 or 2006. Premium Financing Operations          Certain of Aon's U.S., U.K., Canadian and Australian subsidiaries originate short-term loans (generally with terms of 12 months or less) tobusinesses to finance their insurance premium obligations, and then sell these premium finance agreements in securitization transactions that meet the criteria for sale accounting under FASB StatementNo. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities. These sales involve SPEs, which areconsidered qualified special purpose entities (""QSPEs"") according to Statement No. 140 and multi-seller, non-qualified bank commercial paper conduit SPEs (""Bank SPEs"") that arevariable interest entities 113 accordingto FIN 46. Statement No. 140 provides that a QSPE should not be consolidated in the financial statements of a transferor or its affiliates (Aon's subsidiaries).         TheCompany has analyzed qualitative and quantitative factors related to Aon subsidiaries' interests in the Bank SPEs and has determined that these subsidiaries are not the sponsors ofthe Bank SPEs. Additionally, independent third parties (i) have made substantial equity investments in the Bank SPEs, (ii) have voting control of the Bank SPEs, and(iii) generally bear the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets of the Bank SPEs. Aon has concluded that non-consolidation of the Bank SPEs is appropriate in accordance withFIN 46 given that the subsidiaries do not have significant variable interests.         Throughthe securitization agreements, Aon, or one of its QSPEs, sells undivided interests in specified premium finance agreements to the Bank SPEs. The aggregate amount advanced onpremium finance agreements sold to the Bank SPEs at any one time is limited by the securitization agreements to a maximum of $1.8 billion at both December 31, 2007 and 2006. The BankSPEs had advanced $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The origination and sale of eligible premium finance agreements that are sold to theBank SPEs increase available advances, and collections (administered by Aon) on previously sold agreements reduce available advances.         Aonrecords gains associated with the sale of receivables. When Aon calculates the gains, all anticipated fees related to this facility are included. The gains included in commissions,fees and otherin the consolidated statements of income were $64 million, $63 million and $65 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.         Aonrecords at fair value its retained interest in the sold premium finance agreements, and reports it in receivables in the consolidated statements of financial position. Aon alsoretains servicing rights for sold agreements and earns servicing fee income over the servicing period. The servicing fees are included in the gain/loss calculation. At December 31, 2007 and2006, the fair value of the servicing rights approximates the estimated costs to service the receivables and accordingly, Aon has not recorded any servicing assets or liabilities related to thisservicing activity.         Aonestimates fair value by discounting estimated future cash flows from its retained interest in the sold receivables using discount rates that approximate current market rates andexpected future prepayment rates.         TheBank SPEs bear the credit risks on the receivables, subject to limited recourse in the form of over-collateralization required on the sale of the receivables.         Allbut the Australian facility require Aon to maintain consolidated net worth, as defined, of at least $2.5 billion, consolidated EBITDA to consolidated net interest of at least4 to 1 and consolidated indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA of no more than 3 to 1.         Aonintends to renew the conduit facilities when they expire. If there were adverse bank, regulatory, tax or accounting rule changes, Aon's access to the conduit facilities and specialpurpose vehicles would be restricted. Following the appropriate accounting standards, these special purpose vehicles are not included in Aon's consolidated financial statements. Fair Value of Financial Instruments          Accounting standards require the disclosure of fair values for certain financial instruments. The fair value disclosures are not intended to encompass variousother non-financial instruments or other intangible assets related to Aon's business. Accordingly, care should be exercised in deriving conclusions about Aon's business or financialcondition based on the fair value disclosures. The basis for determining the fair value of financial instruments is discussed in Note 1. The carrying value approximates or equals fair value forthe following instruments: cash, receivables, short-term 114 investments,fixed maturity investments, equity securities, other investments, derivative assets and liabilities, insurance premiums payable, short-term debt and accounts payable andaccrued liabilities. The following table discloses the Company's financial instruments where the carrying amounts and fair values differ: (millions)    As of December 31  2007 2006  CarryingValue FairValue CarryingValue FairValueLong-term debt $1,893 $1,920 $2,243 $2,561Guarantees and Indemnifications          Aon provides a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to its customers and others. The maximum potential amount of future payments represents the notionalamounts that could become payable under the guarantees and indemnifications if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties, without consideration of possible recoveries under recourseprovisions or other methods. These amounts may bear no relationship to the expected future payments, if any, for these guarantees and indemnifications. Any anticipated amounts payable which are deemedto be probable and estimable are accrued in Aon's consolidated financial statements.         Guaranteesassociated with Aon's limited partnership securitization are disclosed in Note 6. Indemnities related to discontinued operations are disclosed in Note 5.Guarantees with respect to reinsurance recoverables associated with the sale of AWG are disclosed in Note 9.         Aonand its subsidiaries have issued letters of credit to cover contingent payments of approximately $4 million for taxes and other business obligations to third parties. Amountsare accrued in the consolidated financial statements for these letters of credit to the extent they are probable and estimable.         Aonhas certain contractual contingent guarantees for premium payments owed by clients to certain insurance companies. Costs associated with these guarantees, to the extent estimable andprobable, are provided in Aon's allowance for doubtful accounts. The maximum exposure with respect to such contractual contingent guarantees was approximately $15 million at December 31,2007.         Aonexpects that as prudent business interests dictate, additional guarantees and indemnifications may be issued from time to time. 115 14.  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets                                                                                       Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units,which are one reporting level below the operating segment. Goodwill is not amortized but is instead subject to impairment testing at least annually. The impairment testing requires Aon to compare thefair value of its reporting units to their carrying value to determine if there is potential impairment of goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value at thevaluation date, an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the recorded amount of goodwill. Fair value isestimated based on various valuation approaches. In the fourth quarter 2007 and 2006, Aon completed its annual impairment review that affirmed there was no impairment as of October 1 (theannual evaluation date).         Whena business entity is sold, goodwill is allocated to the disposed entity based on the fair value of that entity compared to the fair value of the reporting unit in which it isincluded.         Thechanges in the net carrying amount of goodwill by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, are as follows: (millions) Risk andInsuranceBrokerageServices Consulting Total  Balance as of January 1, 2007 $4,142 $379 $4,521 Goodwill acquired  155  1  156 Goodwill related to disposals  (11)   (11)Foreign currency revaluation  261  8  269  Balance as of December 31, 2007 $4,547 $388 $4,935  Balance as of January 1, 2006 $3,753 $378 $4,131 Goodwill acquired  124  1  125 Goodwill related to disposals  (11)   (11)Foreign currency revaluation  276    276  Balance as of December 31, 2006 $4,142 $379 $4,521          Other intangible assets are classified into two categories: ""CustomerRelated and Contract Based"" include client lists as well as non-compete covenants, and""Marketing,Technology and Other"" are all other purchased intangibles not included in the preceding categories. 116         Otherintangible assets by asset class are as follows: (millions) CustomerRelated andContract Based Marketing,Technologyand Other TotalAs of December 31, 2007          Gross carrying amount $206 $332 $538 Accumulated amortization  168  166  334 Net carrying amount $38 $166 $204As of December 31, 2006          Gross carrying amount $232 $245 $477 Accumulated amortization  203  129  332 Net carrying amount $29 $116 $145        The cost of other intangible assets is being amortized over a range of 2 to 10 years, with a weighted average original life of 8 years. Amortizationexpense for intangible assets for the years ending December 31, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 is estimated to be $37 million, $35 million, $32 million, $28 millionand $20 million, respectively.         Whenimpairment indicators arise, Aon assesses the recoverability of its intangible assets through an analysis of expected future cash flows. 117  15.  Contingencies                                                                                                              Aon and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims, tax assessments, lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business.The damages claimed in these matters are or may be substantial, including, in many instances, claims for punitive, treble or extraordinary damages. Aon has purchased errors and omissions (""E&O"")insurance and other appropriate insurance to provide protection against losses that arise in such matters. Accruals for these items, and related insurance receivables, when applicable, have beenprovided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable. These accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as developments warrant. Amounts related tosettlement provisions are recorded in other general expenses in the consolidated statements of income.         In2004, Aon, other insurance brokers, insurers and numerous other industry participants received subpoenas and other requests for information from the office of the Attorney General ofthe State of New York and from other states relating to certain practices in the insurance industry. On March 4, 2005, Aon entered into an agreement (the ""Settlement Agreement"") with theAttorney General of the State of New York, the Superintendent of Insurance of the State of New York, the Attorney General of the State of Connecticut, the Illinois Attorney General and the Director ofthe Division of Insurance, Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (collectively, the ""State Agencies"") to resolve all the issues related to investigations conducted by the StateAgencies. The 2005 Settlement Agreement, under which Aon distributed funds to certain clients and implemented business reforms, has been described in detail in Aon's previous financial filings. Aonhas also entered into a comprehensive settlement agreement, under the auspices of the NAIC, with numerous other states that incorporate these same business reforms.         Purportedclients have also filed civil litigation against Aon and other companies under a variety of laws and legal theories relating to broker compensation practices and other issuesunder investigation by New York and other states. As previously reported, a putative class action styled Daniel v. Aon (Affinity) has been pending inthe Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois since August 1999. In March 2005, the Court gave preliminary approval to a nationwide class action settlement under which Aon agreed to pay a total of$38 million to its policyholders. The Court granted final approval to the settlement in March 2006. Parties that objected to the settlement have appealed.         Beginningin June 2004, a number of other putative class actions were filed against Aon and other companies by purported classes of clients under a variety of legal theories, includingstate tort, contract, fiduciary duty, antitrust and statutory theories and federal antitrust and Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (""RICO"") theories. The federal actions wereconsolidated in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, and a state court collective action was filed in California. In the New Jersey actions, the Court dismissed plaintiffs' federalantitrust and RICO claims in separate orders in August and October 2007, respectively. Plaintiffs have appealed these dismissals. Aon believes it has meritorious defenses in all of these cases andintends to vigorously defend itself against these claims. The outcome of these lawsuits, and any losses or other payments that may occur as a result, cannot be predicted at this time.         Beginningin late October 2004, several putative securities class actions were filed against Aon in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Also beginning in lateOctober 2004, several putative ERISA class actions were filed against Aon in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Aon believes it has meritorious defenses in all of thesecases and intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims. The outcome of these lawsuits, and any losses or other payments that may occur as a result, cannot be predicted at this time. Withrespect to the various securities and ERISA class actions, we are unable to estimate a range of possible losses, as these actions have not yet progressed to the stages where damages, if any, can beestimated. 118         Followinginquiries from regulators, the Company commenced an internal review of its compliance with certain U.S. and non-U.S. anti-bribery laws, including theU.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA""). An outside law firm with significant experience in the area is overseeing the review. Certain governmental agencies, including the U.K. Financial ServicesAuthority, the City of London police, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the U.S. Department of Justice, are also investigating these matters. Aon is fully cooperating with theseinvestigations, and has agreed with the U.S. agencies to toll any applicable statute of limitations pending completion of the investigations. Based on current information, the Company is unable topredict at this time when these matters will be concluded, or what regulatory or other outcomes may result.         Afinancial institution in the U.K. called Standard Life Assurance Ltd. brought an action in London Commercial Court against Aon seeking more than £50 million ($99million at December 31, 2007 exchange rates) for alleged errors or omissions in the placement of a professional indemnity policy with certain underwriters. In a decision issued on February 13,2008, the court construed the relevant policy language to excuse underwriters from paying Standard Life and concluded that Aon was negligent in not seeking changes to the language. The court grantedAon leave to file an interlocutory appeal on these issues and stated in granting leave that the issue in the case was a ""difficult question of construction on which views may legitimately differ."" Aonbelieves that the decision is incorrect, is appealing this decision and, if the appeal is unsuccessful, will vigorously contest other issues that have not yet been litigated in the Commercial Court.Aon further believes that, as a result of an indemnity given to Aon by a third party, Aon may be entitled to indemnification in whole or part should it ultimately suffer a loss in this matter. Becauseof the uncertainty inherent in the appeals process, theability to contest issues in subsequent proceedings, the potential indemnity, and potential recoveries from Aon's errors and omissions insurance, Aon is unable to predict at this time the probableloss, if any, from this matter.         Althoughthe ultimate outcome of all matters referred to above cannot be ascertained, and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on Aon or its subsidiaries, on the basis ofpresent information, amounts already provided, availability of insurance coverages and legal advice received, it is the opinion of management that the disposition or ultimate determination of suchclaims will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of Aon. However, it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly orannual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters. 119 16.  Segment Information                                                                                                        Aon classifies its businesses into two operating segments: Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services and Consulting. Unallocated income and expenses,when combined with the operating segments and after the elimination of intersegment revenues, totals to the amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Results relating to Aon'saccident, health and life operations, which were previously reported in a separate Insurance Underwriting segment, have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented. Theremaining operations that were previously reported in the Insurance Underwriting segment, which relate to property and casualty insurance that is in runoff, are now included in unallocated income andexpense for all periods presented.         Theaccounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in Note 1, except that the disaggregated financial results have been prepared using a managementapproach, which is consistent with the basis and manner in which Aon senior management internally disaggregates financial information for the purposes of assisting in making internal operatingdecisions. Aon evaluates performance based on stand-alone operating segment income before income taxes and generally accounts for intersegment revenue as if the revenue were from third parties, thatis, considered by management to be at current market prices.         Revenuesare generally attributed to geographic areas based on the location of the resources producing the revenues. Intercompany revenues and expenses are eliminated in computingconsolidated revenues and other general expenses.         Consolidatedrevenue by geographic area is as follows: (millions) Total United States Americas other than U.S. United Kingdom Europe,Middle East,& Africa Asia PacificYears ended December 31                   2007 $7,471 $2,855 $809 $1,305 $1,876 $626 2006  6,881  2,789  723  1,172  1,636  561 2005  6,651  2,726  646  1,226  1,530  523        The Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment consists principally of Aon's retail and reinsurance brokerage operations, as well as related insuranceservices, including underwriting management, captive insurance company management services, and premium financing.         TheConsulting segment provides a broad range of consulting services.

(1)Seenotes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 15(a).(2)Investmentsin subsidiaries include approximately $3.3 billion invested in countries outside of the U.S., primarily denominated in the British Pound, the Euro, the Canadiandollar and the Australian dollar.(3)Guaranteesand Indemnifications Aonprovides a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to its customers and others to allow Aon or others to complete a wide variety of business transactions. The maximum potential amount of futurepayments represents the notional amounts that could become payable under the guarantees and indemnifications if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties, without consideration of possiblerecoveries under recourse provisions or other methods. These amounts may bear no relationship to the expected future payments, if any, for these guarantees and indemnifications. Aon does not currentlyanticipate making future payments to any of its subsidiaries, or third parties on behalf of its subsidiaries, for these guarantees and indemnifications. Abank provides overdraft facilities for certain of Aon's foreign subsidiaries. Aon has guaranteed repayment of these facilities in the unlikely event that the foreign subsidiaries are unable torepay. Aon has also issued guarantees and/or other letters of support for various bank lines and various other credit facilities for certain of its foreign operations (including the Euro creditfacility discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements). Aon's maximum potential liability with regard to these exposures was $795 million at December 31, 2007. Asof November 30, 2006 in connection with the sale of AWG, Aon sold VSC. VSC will continue to remain liable to policyholders to the extent reinsurers of the property and casualty business donot meet their obligations. As a result, at both December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, Aon no longer reports reinsurance recoverables related to its property and casualty business,which was not part of the sale of AWG. Aon has provided a corporate guarantee with respect to these reinsurance recoverables, which amounts to $846 million at December 31, 2007. Aonhas a liability for its commitment to contribute $6 million to the Aon Memorial Education Fund to support the educational needs of the children of Aon employees who were victims of theSeptember 11, 2001 attacks. Aonhas guaranteed the obligations of one of its major Netherlands' subsidiaries through 2007. Management believes there is sufficient operating cash flow, liquidity and equity at this subsidiary tocover current obligations and future obligations as they come due. Aonhas issued various other guarantees for miscellaneous purposes at its international subsidiaries for $19 million. Aonexpects that as prudent business interests dictate, additional guarantees and indemnifications may be issued from time to time. 127    Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.             Not Applicable.

Under the U.K. Scheme, employees authorize Aon to deduct a specified amount from compensationeach pay period for deposit into a savings account for a three-year term. If a participant's deductions continue through the last day of the term, the participant is credited with atax-free cash bonus equal to 1.4 times the monthly payroll deduction. Participants may cease participation in the U.K. Scheme at any time and receive their deductions back, plus accruedinterest. Participants are also granted options at the beginning of each savings period and may direct Aon to purchase or issue shares of Aon common stock at a price equal to 85% of the market valueat the beginning of the period, utilizing the accumulated amounts in their account. Options may be exercised generally within six months after the last day of the term, or after death, injury,disability, redundancy or retirement. If a participant ceases to be employed by Aon for other reasons, or declines to purchase Aon common stock during any of the available purchase periods, theparticipant's right to purchase shares of Aon common stock or accumulate additional payroll deductions lapses. The U.K. Scheme was approved by the Board of Directors in 1999. No specific authorizationof shares of Aon common stock for the U.K. Scheme has been made. As of December 31, 2007, the number of shares that could be issued under the plan was 271,233.  Employee Stock Purchase Plan (The Netherlands)  TheNetherlands Employee Stock Purchase Plan provides employees of Aon and participating subsidiaries in the Netherlands the opportunity to purchase Aon common stock at a 15% discount. Contributionsto this plan are made through payroll deductions. The maximum amount is not more than 15% of gross annual income with a maximum of U.S. $10,000. As of December 31, 2007, the number of sharesthat could be issued under the plan was 686 shares.  Aon Supplemental Savings Plan  TheAon Supplemental Savings Plan (the ""Supplemental Plan"") was adopted by the Board of Directors (the ""Board"") in 1998. It is a nonqualified supplemental retirement plan that provides benefits toparticipants in the Aon Savings Plan (the ""ASP"") whose employer matching contributions are limited because of IRS-imposed restrictions. Prior to January 1, 2004, participantscovered under the Supplemental Plan were credited with an additional matching allocation they would have received under the former ASP provisions  100% of the first 1% to 3% ofcompensation (""Tier I"") and 75% of the next 4% to 6% of compensation (""Tier 2"")  had compensation up to $500,000 been considered. Between January 1, 2004 andDecember 31, 2005, only participants defined as employees of Aon Consulting's Human Resource Outsourcing Group maintained the matching provision in the Supplemental Plan. Participants may electto have Tier I allocations credited to their accounts as if invested in a money market account or as if invested in Aon common stock. Tier I allocations directed to an Aon common stockaccount may not be moved to the money market account, regardless of the participant's age. As of January 1, 2006, no participants are eligible for Tier I or Tier II matchingallocations. Before the beginning of each plan year, an election may be made by any participant to transfer some or all of a participant's money market account to the Aon common stockaccount. All amounts credited to the Aon common stock account are credited with dividends and other investment returns as under the ASP fund. EffectiveJanuary 1, 2004, a new Supplemental Plan provision went into effect whereby employees hired January 1, 2004 and later are immediately eligible for benefits on plan compensationabove the IRS limits (and up to $500,000) under the Aon Retirement Account (the ""ARA"") provision of the ASP. The ARA replaces benefits that would have been instead provided under the Aon Pension Planhad it not been frozen to new entrants (those generally hired after December 31, 131 2003).Benefits are in the form of a discretionary non-contributory company contribution made to eligible employees active at the end of the plan year with 1,000 or more hours of paidservice. The Supplemental Plan ARA allocation is calculated using the same formula that the Board determines for the ASP ARA. The Supplemental Plan ARA allocation and account balances will track thesame investment options as selected by the participant under the ASP including the Aon common stock option. However, like the ASP provision, there are no transfer restrictions.  Aon Supplemental Employee Stock Ownership Plan  TheAon Supplemental Employee Stock Ownership Plan was a plan established in 1989 as a nonqualified supplemental retirement plan that provided benefits to participants in the Aon Employee StockOwnership Plan whose employer contributions were limited because of IRS-imposed restrictions. As of 1998, no additional amounts have been credited to participant accounts, although accountbalances are maintained for participants, and credited with dividends, until distribution is required under the plan. Distributions are made solely in Aon common stock. No specific authorization ofshares of Aon common stock for the plan has been made.  Awards to Gregory C. Case Pursuant to Employment Agreement  Pursuantto the Employment Agreement between Gregory C. Case and Aon, dated April 4, 2005, the terms of which are described in the Proxy Statement under the heading ""ExecutiveCompensation"" and are incorporated herein by reference, Mr. Case was granted certain equity compensation awards outsideof the Stock Incentive Plan as inducement for his employment with Aon. Those awards consisted of 125,000 restricted stock units and an option to purchase 325,000 shares of Aon common stock, fora total of 450,000 shares. (6)Theweighted-average exercise price of such shares is uncertain and is not included in this column.(7)Noneof these equity compensation plans contain a limit on the number of shares that may be issued under such plans; however, these plans are subject to the limitations set forth inthe descriptions of these plans contained in footnote 5 above.         Informationrelating to the security owner ownership of certain beneficial owners of Aon's common stock is set forth under the headings ""Principal Holders of Voting Securities"" and""Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management"" in the Proxy Statement and all such information is incorporated herein by reference.
