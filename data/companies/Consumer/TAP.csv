16,TAP,MOLSON COORS BREWING CO,2024-02-20,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORSInvesting in our Company involves risk. Investors should carefully consider the following risk factors and the other information contained within this report. The risks set forth below are those that management believes are most likely to have a material adverse effect on us. Investors are encouraged to read each risk factor as related and interconnected to the other risk factors set forth in this section. However, the risks set forth below are not a comprehensive description of the risks facing our Company. We may also be subject to other risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial but may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods. Investors should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk has not already materialized. If the following risks or uncertainties, individually or in combination, actually occur, they may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations or prospects. See also ""Cautionary Statement Pursuant to Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995."" Risks Related to our Company and OperationsDeterioration of general economic, political, credit and/or capital market conditions, including those caused by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, or other geopolitical tensions, could adversely affect our financial performance, our ability to grow or sustain our business, financial condition and results of operations, and our ability to access the capital markets.    We compete around the world in various geographic regions and product markets. Global economic and political conditions affect our business and the businesses of our customers, suppliers and consumers. Recessions, economic downturns, price instability, inflation, slowing economic growth, social and political instability, and violent crime and related matters in the markets where we compete could negatively affect our revenues and financial performance, and adversely impact our ability to grow or sustain our business. For example, current macroeconomic and political instability caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, global supply chain disruptions and inflation have adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our business and financial results. Specifically, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, has adversely affected the global economy, and the geopolitical tensions and conflicts it has generated and continues to generate negatively impact our operations. It has resulted in heightened economic sanctions from the U.S., the U.K., the European Union and the international community. As a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, in 2022 we suspended all exports of all our brands to Russia and subsequently terminated the license to produce any of our brands in Russia. Even though our sales in Russia have historically been limited, representing less than 0.2% of our 2021 consolidated net sales and less than 1% of our 2021 EMEA&APAC net sales, and we have no physical assets in Russia, the effect of the Russia-Ukraine conflict due to the widespread impact, particularly in Eastern Europe, has had and could continue to have a material adverse outcome on our business, financial condition, results of operations, supply chain, availability of critical supplies, intellectual property, partners, customers or employees. Further escalation of geopolitical tensions related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, including increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade, could result in, among other things, broader impacts that expand into other markets, cyberattacks, energy supply availability shortages, supply chain and logistics disruptions, lower consumer demand, and volatility in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and financial markets, any of which may adversely affect our business and supply chain. Similar geopolitical tensions and political conflicts could adversely impact our employees, financial performance and global operations, including by, among other things, jeopardizing the safety of our employees and facilities, disrupting our and our partners’ production, supply chain and logistics and communications, and causing market volatility, which could adversely impact consumer demand and our sales. More broadly, there could be additional negative impacts to our financial results if the Russia-Ukraine conflict worsens, including, among other potential impacts, economic recessions in certain neighboring countries or globally due to inflationary pressures, including with respect to food, energy and supply chain cost increases or shortages, or the geographic proximity of the conflict relative to the rest of Europe. In addition, the effects of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict could amplify or affect many of our other risks described elsewhere in Part I, Item 1A, ""Risk Factors
"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.14Table of ContentsIn addition, the capital and credit markets provide us with liquidity to operate and grow our business beyond the liquidity that operating cash flows provide, which can vary from period to period. A global or regional economic downturn or disruption of the credit markets could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets necessary for our operations and to execute our strategic plan. If our access to capital on terms commercially acceptable to us were to become significantly constrained, or if costs of capital increased significantly, then our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. Further, continued disruption and declines in the global economy have impacted and could continue to impact our customers' liquidity and capital resources and therefore our ability to collect, or the timeliness of collection of our accounts receivable from them, which may have a material adverse impact on our performance, cash flows and capital resources. Our operations are dependent on the global supply chain and face significant exposure to changes in commodity and other input prices, and impacts of supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures could adversely impact our operating results.    We depend on the effectiveness of our supply chain management to assure reliable and sufficient supply of quality products. Our business has been, and may continue to be, impacted by supply chain constraints, including longer lead times, in part, by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the uncertain economic environment worldwide. These supply chain constraints could put significant inflationary pressures on commodity and other input prices. In addition, current proposed or future governmental policies may increase the risk of inflation, which could further increase the costs of raw materials and other components for our business. We use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials, some of which are purchased through supply contracts with third parties, to produce our products, including barley, malted barley, hops, corn, other various starches, water and packaging materials, including aluminum cans and bottles, glass and polyethylene terephthalate containers as well as cardboard and other paper products. We also use a significant amount of diesel fuel, natural gas, electricity and carbon dioxide in our operations. The supply and price of these raw materials and commodities can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including market demand, inflation, alternative sources for suppliers, global geopolitical events, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict (especially as to their impact on energy supply prices in general, including crude oil prices and the resulting impact on diesel fuel prices), global or regional disease outbreaks or pandemics, trade agreements among producing and consuming nations, governmental regulations (including tariffs), frosts, droughts and other weather conditions, changes in precipitation patterns, the frequency of extreme weather events, economic factors affecting growth decisions, plant diseases, theft and industry surcharges and other practices. Similarly, if the costs of goods continue to increase, our suppliers may seek price increases from us. If we are unable to mitigate the impact of these matters through customer price increases, cost savings to offset cost increases, hedging arrangements, or other measures, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. If our competitors maintain or substantially lower their prices, we may lose customers or mark down prices. Our profitability may be impacted by prices that do not offset the inflationary pressures, which may impact our gross margins. Even if we are able to raise the prices of our products, we may not be able to sustain such price increases and consumers might react negatively to such price increases, which could have a material adverse effect on, among other things, our brand, reputation and sales. Temporary or sustained price increases may also lead to a decrease in demand for our products as competitors may not adjust their prices or consumers may decide not to pay higher prices for our products, which could lead to a decline in sales volume and loss of market share. Our projections may not accurately predict the volume impact of price increases, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Geopolitical tensions may cause delays in shipments of our products and supplies. Failure to adequately produce and timely ship our products to customers could lead to lost potential revenue, failure to meet customer demand, strained relationships with customers, including wholesalers, and diminished brand loyalty. Weak, or weakening of, economic, social or other conditions in the markets in which we do business, including cost inflation and reductions in discretionary consumer spending, could adversely impact demand for our products or cause consumers to suffer financial hardship, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Beer consumption in some of our markets could be closely tied to general economic conditions and a significant portion of our portfolio consists of premium and above premium brands. Difficult macroeconomic conditions in our markets, such as further decreases in per capita income and level of disposable income driven by increases in inflation, energy costs, income (and other) taxes and the cost of living, increased and prolonged unemployment or a further decline in consumer confidence, as well as limited or significantly reduced points of access of our product, political or economic instability or other country-specific factors, could continue to have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products. For example, under difficult or deteriorating economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products by shifting away from our premium and above premium products to lower-priced products offered by us or other companies or by shifting to off-premise from on-premise consumption, negatively impacting our net sales and margins. A significant portion of our consolidated net sales are concentrated in the U.S., Canada and countries in Europe, which represent the majority of net sales within our Americas and EMEA&APAC segments. Therefore, unfavorable 15Table of Contentsmacroeconomic conditions, such as inflationary pressures, a recession or continued slowed economic growth in the U.S., Canada or countries in Europe, could negatively affect consumer demand for our products in these important markets, which consequently, may negatively affect the results of operations in our Americas and EMEA&APAC segments. Softer consumer demand for our products could reduce our profitability and would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Loss, operational disruptions or closure of a major brewery or other key facility, including those of our suppliers, due to unforeseen or catastrophic events or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Our business could be interrupted and our financial results could be materially adversely impacted by physical risks such as earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, floods, acts of war, terrorist attacks, cyberattacks and other disruptions in information systems, such as the March 2021 cybersecurity incident, disease outbreaks or pandemics and other natural disasters or catastrophic events that damage, disrupt or destroy one of our breweries or key facilities or the key facilities of our significant suppliers. If any of our breweries or key facilities or the key facilities of our significant suppliers experience a significant operational disruption or catastrophic loss, it could delay, disrupt or reduce production, shipments and revenue, and result in potentially significant expenses to repair or replace these properties. Such significant disruptions could be due to, among other things:•the loss or disruption of the timely availability of adequate supplies of essential raw materials for us and our suppliers, including single-source suppliers; •our ability to effectively integrate new suppliers into our operations;•material financial issues facing our suppliers, such as bankruptcy or similar proceedings; •transportation and logistics challenges, including as a result of governmental restrictions and the availability and capacity of shipping channels as customers may shift to increased online shopping; •the loss or disruption of other manufacturing, distribution and supply capabilities; •labor shortages, strikes or work stoppages; •the loss or disruption of the supply of carbon dioxide gas; •acts of war and terrorism; or•natural disasters, pandemics, public health crises, or other catastrophic events and the associated impacts of such events, including impacts on our employees, their families, or our suppliers.We experienced certain of the foregoing risks and losses in connection with the March 2021 cybersecurity incident and the coronavirus pandemic. Additionally, certain catastrophes are not covered by our general insurance policies, which could result in significant unrecoverable losses. Our business and results of operations could also be adversely impacted by under-investment in physical assets or production capacity, including contract brewing and effect on the priority of our brands if production capacity is limited. Further, significant excess capacity at any of our breweries as a result of increased efficiencies in our supply chain process or continued volume declines could result in under-utilization of our assets, which could lead to excess overhead expenses or additional costs incurred associated with the closure of one or more of our facilities. For example, as part of a strategic review of our supply chain network, certain breweries and bottling lines were closed in recent years, and we have incurred brewery closure costs, including charges associated with the closure of the Irwindale brewery in 2020, which was subsequently sold to Pabst Brewing Company, LLC in the fourth quarter of 2020. We regularly review our supply chain network to ensure that our supply chain capacity is aligned with the needs of the business. Such reviews could potentially result in further closures and the related costs could be material.Cybersecurity incidents impacting our information systems, and violations of data privacy laws and regulations could disrupt our business operations and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.    Our information systems may be the target of cyberattacks or other security breaches, which, if successful, could, among other things, disrupt our operations, applications and services, cause the loss of key business, employee, customer or vendor information, cause us to breach our legal, regulatory or contractual obligations, prevent us from accessing or relying upon critical business records, cause reputational damage, or impact the costs or ability to obtain adequate insurance coverage. These incidents may result from human errors, equipment failure, or fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties. The risk of cyber threats or cyberattacks increases as we rely more on digital partners, including supply-chain partners integrated into our business, who may also be the target of cyberattacks or other security breaches. If our information systems suffer severe disruption, damage, or shutdown we could experience delays and disruptions in our business, including brewery operations, production and shipments and delays in reporting our financial results, such as those we experienced with the March 2021 cybersecurity incident, which could adversely affect our cash flows, competitive position, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. A breach of our information systems, such as the March 2021 cybersecurity incident, could subject us to litigation, 16Table of Contentsincluding class action or derivative lawsuits, regulatory fines, and penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results or reputation. We have seen an increase in the number of cyberattacks due, in part, to the large number of our employees and contractors that are working and accessing our technology infrastructure remotely because of shifts in working arrangements. In addition, the March 2021 cybersecurity incident may embolden other individuals or groups to target our information systems and impact the costs or ability for us to obtain adequate insurance coverages moving forward. Furthermore, continued geopolitical turmoil, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, has heightened the risk of cyberattacks. As discussed further below, the rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies may intensify our cybersecurity risks.We expend significant financial resources to protect against cyber threats and cyberattacks. We may be required to incur further costs to alleviate problems and remedy damage caused by physical, electronic and cybersecurity breaches and to address possible increased information system attacks as a result of the incident, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. These events may not be insured against or may not be fully covered by any insurance maintained by us. Additionally, there is no assurance that the limitations of liability in any of our contracts would be enforceable or adequate to protect us from liabilities or damages as a result of a cyberattack or other cybersecurity incident. As techniques used to breach security are growing in frequency and sophistication and are generally not recognized until launched against a target, we may not be able to implement security measures in a timely manner or, if and when implemented, these measures could be circumvented regardless of our expenditures and protection efforts. We could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, we incurred certain incremental one-time costs of $2.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 related to consultants, experts and data recovery efforts, net of insurance recoveries. Although we attempt to vigorously monitor and mitigate against cyber risks, including through leveraging multi-sourced threat intelligence and investing in new technologies, we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyberattacks or other cybersecurity incidents.Misuse, leakage or falsification of information could result in a violation of data privacy laws and regulations, including but not limited to, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, California Privacy Rights Act, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, or the Colorado Privacy Act, may damage our reputation and credibility or expose us to increased risk of lawsuits, loss of existing or potential future customers and/or increases in our security costs and compliance burden, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Other jurisdictions in which we operate have enacted or are proposing similar laws and regulations related to data privacy. In addition, we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information and may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight or consumers may avoid our brands due to negative publicity. In the event of a breach resulting in loss of data, such as personally identifiable information or other such data protected by data privacy or other laws, even if encrypted, we may be liable for damages, fines and penalties for such losses under applicable regulatory frameworks despite not handling the data. Further, the regulatory framework around data custody, data privacy and breaches may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and is an evolving area of law. We may not be able to limit our liability or damages in the event of such a loss.Finally, the SEC has adopted new rules that require us to provide greater disclosures around cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance, as well as disclose the occurrence of material cybersecurity incidents. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we will incur in order to comply with these rules or the timing of such costs. These rules and regulations may also require us to report a cybersecurity incident before we have been able to fully assess its impact or remediate the underlying issue. Efforts to comply with such reporting requirements could divert management's attention from our incident response and could potentially reveal system vulnerabilities to threat actors. Failure to timely report incidents under these or other similar rules could also result in monetary fines, sanctions or subject us to other forms of liability. This regulatory environment is increasingly challenging, and may present material obligations and risks to our business, including significantly expanded compliance burdens, costs and enforcement risks.The success of our business relies heavily on brand image, reputation, product quality and protection of intellectual property.    It is important that we maintain and enhance the image and reputation of our existing brands and products, including our corporate purpose, mission and values. Concerns about product quality, even when unsubstantiated, could be harmful to our image and the reputation of our brands and products. While we have quality control programs in place, in the event we or our third-party manufacturers experience an issue with product quality or if any of our products become unsafe or unfit for consumption, are misbranded or cause injury, we may experience recalls or liability in addition to business disruption which could further negatively impact our brand image and reputation, negatively affect our sales and cause us to incur additional costs. A widespread product recall, multiple product recalls or a significant product liability judgment could cause our products to be unavailable for a period of time, which could further reduce consumer demand and brand equity. We also could be exposed to lawsuits relating to product liability, marketing or sales practices or intellectual property infringement. Our brand image and reputation may also be difficult to protect due to less oversight and control as a result of outsourcing some of our 17Table of Contentsoperations internationally or entering new or different product lines. If we are unable to address and uphold our plans with respect to our ESG initiatives or actions by and attitudes of regulators and the public health community, our image and brand equity may deteriorate, which may be difficult to combat or reverse and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, because our brands carry family names or we may partner with celebrities or other famous sponsors, personal activities by certain members of the Molson or Coors families, our promotional partners or business partners that harm their public image or reputation could also have an adverse effect on our brands or our reputation. Our brand image, reputation and financial results may be negatively impacted by our ability to navigate social media campaigns and trends in pursuit of various dynamic issues facing society on regional and global levels across the markets in which we operate.  Further, our success is dependent on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, including trademarks, patents, domain names, trade secrets and know-how. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be sufficient or that third parties will not infringe upon or misappropriate these rights or that other parties may claim that our brands infringe on their intellectual property rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. The global beer industry and the broader alcohol industry are constantly evolving, and our position within the global beer industry and the success of our products in our markets may fundamentally change. If we do not successfully transform along with the evolving industry, market dynamics and consumer preferences, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.    The brewing industry has significantly evolved over the years becoming an increasingly consolidated global beer market. For many years, the industry operated primarily on local presence with modest international expansion achieved through export, license and partnership arrangements. In contrast, it has now become increasingly complex and competitive as the consolidation of brewers has resulted in fewer major market participants. As a result of the increased global consolidation of brewers and the dynamic of an expanding new segment within the industry with new market entrants, the markets in which we operate, particularly the more mature markets, may evolve at a disadvantage to our current market position. In addition, local governments may intervene, which may fundamentally accelerate transformational changes to such markets. For example, the beer markets in the U.S. and Canada have long consisted of a select number of significant market participants with government-regulated routes to market. In Canada, changes to interprovincial trade rules, regulations, distribution models and packaging requirements, such as government-owned retail outlets and industry standard returnable bottles, may be disadvantageous to us. As discussed further below, in December 2023 the Province of Ontario announced a set of non-binding key principles (""Key Principles"") concerning the intended features of the future marketplace for beer distribution and retail systems in the Province of Ontario. Evolution in certain of our beer markets, together with emerging changes to consumer preferences, have resulted in a significant increase in market entrants, consumer choices and market competition, as well as increased government scrutiny. Our Coors Light and Miller Lite brands in the Americas, and Carling, Staropramen, Coors, Madri, Ožujsko, and Bergenbier brands in EMEA&APAC represented more than half of each respective segment's sales volumes in 2023. Additionally, several of our brands represent a significant share of their respective market and, therefore, continued volatility in these markets could disproportionately impact the performance of these brands. Consequently, any material shift in consumer preferences away from these brands, or from the categories in which they compete, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Furthermore, the broader alcohol industry is experiencing a shift in drinking preferences and behaviors of consumers due to, among others, changing taste preferences, changing demographics, downturns in economic conditions or perceived value, as well as changes in consumers' perception of our brands and the brands of our competitors due to negative publicity, regulatory actions or litigation. There has been more attention focused on health concerns and the harmful consumption of alcoholic beverages, which could result in a change in the social acceptability of beer and other alcoholic beverages, which could materially impact the consumption of beer, other alcoholic beverages and, consequently, our sales. If we are unsuccessful in evolving with, and navigating through, these changes to the markets in which we operate, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Specifically, the markets in which we operate have experienced vast expansion in above premium products, specifically in flavored malt beverages (including hard seltzers), ready-to-drink beverages, spirit-based beverages, craft beer, cider, and other similar beverages. If our competitors are able to respond more quickly to the evolving trends within those and similar beverage categories, or if our new products in these categories are not successful, our business and financial results may be adversely impacted.Our products also generally compete with other alcoholic beverages. We compete with other beer and alcoholic beverage companies not only for legal age drinker acceptance and loyalty, but also for shelf, cold box and tap space in retail establishments and for marketing focus by our distributors and their customers, all of which also distribute and sell other beers and alcoholic beverage products. If we do not successfully transform along with the evolving industry and market dynamics and consumer preferences, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.18Table of ContentsCompetition in our markets could require us to reduce prices or increase capital and other expenditures or cause us to lose sales volume, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    In many of our markets, our primary competitors may have greater financial, marketing, production and distribution resources than we do, and may be more diverse in terms of their geographies and brand portfolios. Furthermore, our competitors may respond to industry and economic conditions and shifts in consumer behaviors more rapidly or effectively than us. In order for us to remain competitive, we will need to quickly and correctly adopt digital technologies, build analytical capabilities and scale brand expense investment levels, which our competitors may be able to achieve faster and with more resources. In all of the markets in which we operate, aggressive marketing strategies, such as reduced pricing, brand positioning, and increased capital or other investments by these competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, continuing consolidation among major global brewers and between brewers and other beverage companies and convergence of beverage categories may lead to stronger or new competitors, loss of partner brands, negative impacts on our distributor networks, alternate distribution networks and pressures from marketing and pricing tactics by competitors. Further consolidation of distributors in our industry could reduce our ability to promote our brands in the markets in a manner that enhances rather than diminishes our brands' value, as well as reduce our ability to manage our pricing effectively and efficiently. Additionally, due to competition with brewers and other beverage companies, an increase in the purchasing power of our large competitors may cause further pricing pressures which could prevent us from increasing prices to recover higher costs necessary to compete. Such pressures could have a material adverse impact on our business and our financial results and market share. Failure to generate cost savings and margin improvement through our ongoing initiatives could adversely affect our profitability. Increased pressures for reduced pricing or difficulties in increasing prices while remaining competitive within our markets, as well as the need for increased capital investment, marketing and other expenditures could result in lower profitability or loss of market share and volumes. We may also face inflationary pressures that may negatively influence our or our competitors' prices and reduce margins on our products. Moreover, most of our major markets are mature, so growth opportunities may be more limited to us than to our global competitors who may already be in such markets. For example, net sales in our Americas segment accounted for approximately 81% of our total 2023 net sales. As a result, to the extent that we are unable to maintain or grow our market share in our mature markets, our sales and, in turn, business and financial results could be materially and adversely affected.Our success as an enterprise depends on our ability to successfully and timely innovate beyond beer, and any inability to deliver new products could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    As part of our Acceleration Plan, our future growth will depend, in part, on our ability to timely innovate and develop new products beyond traditional beer. In connection with our Acceleration Plan, we plan to continue to innovate, test and scale products. In addition, we also rely on certain arrangements with partner brands for innovation, development and growth in new products beyond beer. However, the launch and ongoing success of new products are inherently uncertain, especially with respect to consumer appeal. The launch of a new product can give rise to a variety of incremental or one-time costs and an unsuccessful launch or short-lived popularity of our product innovations could, among other things, affect consumer perception of our existing brands and our reputation as well as result in inventory write-offs and other costs. Our inability to attract consumers to our product innovations relative to our competitors’ products, especially over time, could have a material adverse effect on our growth, business and financial results.Changes in the social acceptability, perceptions and the political view of the beverage categories in which we operate, including alcohol, could adversely affect our business.    In recent years, there has been an increase in public and political attention on health and well-being as they relate to alcoholic beverages and the other categories in which we operate due in part to public concern over alcohol-related social problems, including driving under the influence, underage drinking and exposure to alcohol advertisements, and health consequences from the harmful use and misuse of alcohol. Negative publicity regarding alcoholic beverages and changes in consumer perceptions in relation to beer or other alcoholic beverages could adversely affect the sale and consumption of our products, which could adversely affect our business and financial results. Additionally, the concerns around alcohol, as well as health and well-being, could result in unfavorable regulations or other legal requirements in certain markets in which we operate, such as advertising, selling and other restrictions, increased taxes associated with our sales, or the establishment of minimum unit pricing. Any such regulations or requirements could change consumer and customer purchasing patterns and may require us to incur significant compliance costs, which could negatively impact our business and financial results. In particular, advocates of prohibition and other severe restrictions on the marketing and sales of alcohol are becoming increasingly organized and coordinated on a global basis, seeking to impose laws or regulations or to bring actions against us, to substantially curtail the consumption of alcohol, including beer, in developed and developing markets. Further, the alcohol industry may be criticized and experience an increase in the number of publications and studies, as well as lobbying efforts, arguing there is no safe level of alcohol consumption. To the extent such views gain traction in regulations of jurisdictions in which we do or plan to do business, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, in February 2021, the European Union published its Europe Beating Cancer Plan. As part of the plan, the European Union has indicated it may issue a proposal for mandatory health warnings on alcohol beverage product labels. In addition, Ireland passed a law requiring new health warning labels on our products.19Table of ContentsArtificial intelligence presents challenges that can impact our business by posing security risks to confidential or proprietary information and personal data.    The use of artificial intelligence, combined with an uncertain regulatory environment, may result in reputational harm, liability, or other adverse consequences to our business operations. Molson Coors may adopt and integrate artificial intelligence tools into our systems for specific use cases after review by legal and information security. Our vendors and third-party partners may incorporate artificial intelligence tools into their offerings with or without disclosing this use to us. The providers of these artificial intelligence tools may not meet existing or rapidly evolving regulatory or industry standards concerning privacy and data protection, which may result in a loss of intellectual property or confidential information and/or cause harm to our reputation and the public perception of the effectiveness of our security measures. Further, bad actors around the world use increasingly sophisticated methods, including the use of artificial intelligence, to engage in illegal activities involving the theft and misuse of personal information, confidential information and intellectual property. Any of these outcomes could damage our reputation, result in the loss of valuable property and information and adversely impact our business.Due to a high concentration of workers represented by unions or trade councils, we could be significantly affected by labor strikes, work stoppages or other employee-related issues.    As of December 31, 2023, approximately 30% and 24% of our Americas and EMEA&APAC workforces, respectively, are represented by trade unions or councils. Stringent labor laws in certain of our key markets expose us to a greater risk of loss should we experience labor disruptions in those markets. From time to time, our collective bargaining agreements come due for renegotiation, and, if we are unable to timely complete negotiations, affected employees may strike, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. Furthermore, there may be additional work stoppages, unionization efforts or other employee-related issues, either prior to or following the expiration of these agreements, each of which could significantly affect our business and financial results. A prolonged labor strike, work stoppage, unionization efforts or other employee-related issues could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, in the first few months of 2021, we experienced a labor disruption with our Toronto brewery unionized employees resulting from on going negotiations of the collective bargaining agreement which resulted in slightly slower than expected production at the Toronto brewery in the first few months of 2021. In addition, at the end of March through mid-June 2022, approximately 400 unionized employees in our Montreal/Longueuil, Québec brewery and distribution centers went on strike, which adversely affected our business, operations and financial results during the second and third quarters of 2022. Furthermore, on February 17, 2024, the Teamsters Local 997 initiated a strike at our Fort Worth, Texas brewery in the U.S. We have contingency plans in place designed to mitigate the potential financial impact and we remain committed to reaching an agreement that is fair to both our employees and to the Fort Worth brewery.ESG issues and regulations, including those related to climate change and sustainability, and stakeholder response thereto may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation.    Companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny relating to their ESG practices and policies. The landscape related to ESG regulation, compliance, and reporting is constantly evolving, including expanding in scope and complexity. For example, the SEC, the State of California, and the European Commission have published proposed or final rules, including the European Commission's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, that would require significantly increased disclosures related to climate change and other issues. We may experience significant future cost increases associated with regulatory compliance for ESG matters, including fees, licenses, reporting, and the cost of capital improvements for our operating facilities to meet environmental regulatory requirements. Increased focus and activism related to ESG may hinder our access to capital or negatively impact our stock price, as investors may reconsider their capital investment based on their assessment of our ESG practices and policies. In particular, investor advocacy groups, institutional investors, stockholders, employees, consumers, customers, regulators, proxy advisory services and other market participants have increasingly focused on ESG practices and policies of companies. These stakeholders have placed increased importance on ESG practices and their effect on companies from an investor, consumer, customer or employee perspective. If our ESG practices do not meet investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards or evolving regulatory requirements, our stock price, brand, sales, ability to access capital markets, reputation and employee retention, among other things, may be negatively affected. In addition, we have published goals across a range of ESG areas, including environmental sustainability, greenhouse gas emissions, and diversity, equity and inclusion (""DEI"") matters. Although we intend to meet these goals, we may be required to expend significant resources to do so, which could increase our operational costs. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope or nature of these goals, or for any revisions to our goals. Moreover, we may determine that it is in the best interest of our Company and our stockholders to prioritize other business, social, governance or sustainable investments over the achievement of our current goals based on economic, technological developments, regulatory and social factors, business strategy or pressure from investors, activist groups or other stakeholders. If we do not adapt to or comply with new ESG regulations, such as those related to climate change, carbon emissions and related ESG disclosure requirements, or fail to meet the ESG goals under Our Imprint 2025 strategy or evolving investor, industry or stakeholder expectations and standards, or if we are perceived (whether or not valid) to have not responded appropriately to the growing and various concerns for ESG issues, customers and consumers may choose to stop purchasing our products or purchase products from a competitor, and our reputation, business or financial results may be adversely affected.  Further, if we incur adverse publicity and reaction from investors, activist groups or other 20Table of Contentsstakeholders related to our ESG efforts and goals, the perception of us and our products and services by current and potential customers, as well as investors, could be adversely impacted which could adversely impact our business and financial results.Climate change and other weather events may negatively affect our business and financial results.    There is concern that the continuing increase in global average temperatures could cause significant changes in global weather patterns and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Global climate change could have various impacts on our operations, ranging from more frequent extreme weather events to extensive governmental policy developments, which have the potential individually or collectively to significantly disrupt our business as well as negatively affect our suppliers, supply chain and customers. Changing weather patterns and more volatile weather conditions could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions that may impact quality, limit availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities, such as hops, barley and other cereal grains, which are important ingredients for our products. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions, including power disruptions and/or water availability implications due to the foregoing, could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain, distribution networks and routes to market, or impact demand for our products, any of which may cause us to experience additional costs to maintain or resume operations.Public concern over climate change has resulted in, and may continue to result in, new or increased regional, federal and global legal and regulatory requirements, including taxation, to reduce or mitigate carbon emissions and to limit or impose additional costs on carbon and water usage or other climate-related objectives. In the event that such regulation is more stringent than current regulatory obligations, or the measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor and improve our resource efficiency, we may experience disruptions in, or increases in our costs of, operation and delivery to comply with new regulatory requirements due to investments in facilities and equipment or the relocation of our facilities. If we or our suppliers are required to comply with these laws and regulations, or if we choose to take additional voluntary steps to reduce or mitigate our impact on the climate, we may experience increased costs for energy, production, transportation, and raw materials, increased capital expenditures, or increased insurance premiums and deductibles, each of which could adversely impact our operations. In particular, proposed, new or inconsistent regulation and taxation of fuel and energy could increase the cost of complying with such laws and regulations as well as the cost of operation, including fuel required to operate our facilities or transport and distribute our products, thereby increasing the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. Any assessment of the potential impact of future climate change legislation, regulations or industry standards, as well as any international treaties and accords, is uncertain given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in the countries in which we operate.Beyond the commercial pressures implicated by climate change concerns, our operations may face potential adverse physical effects. For example, we have a major brewery in the state of Colorado, which experienced several significant wildfires in 2022, and we have another major brewery in Texas, which experienced a severe winter weather event in 2021. If any of our properties and production facilities experience a significant operational disruption or catastrophic loss due to natural disasters or severe weather events, it could delay or disrupt production, shipments, and revenue, and result in potentially significant expenses to repair or replace these properties, which may negatively affect our business and financial results.An inadequate supply or availability of quality water could have a material adverse effect on, among other things, our sales, production processes, other costs and, in turn, profitability.    Quality water is a key ingredient in our brewing process. Clean water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and climate change may increase water scarcity and cause a deterioration of water quality in areas where we maintain brewing operations. The competition for water among domestic, agricultural and manufacturing users is increasing in some of our brewing communities and communities in which we or our suppliers manufacture our other products. Even where water is widely available, water purification, regulatory requirements, and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain our operations. Further, unavailability of clean water at our breweries or our other facilities or the facilities of our suppliers could limit our ability to brew, which could cause a decrease in production.We have substantial brewery operations in the states of Colorado and Texas, which have been areas vulnerable to water scarcity conditions. Certain western states in the U.S. are experiencing an extended drought, which can impact the quality and quantity of agricultural ingredients such as barley and hops. The continuation or recurrence of such conditions could have an adverse effect upon our agricultural supply chain. We and our suppliers are dependent on sufficient amounts of quality water for operation of our breweries and key facilities and the key facilities of our significant suppliers. The suppliers of the agricultural raw materials we purchase are also dependent upon sufficient supplies of quality water for their fields. A substantial reduction in water in certain agricultural areas could result in material losses of crops, such as barley or hops, which could lead to a shortage of our product supply. If water available to our operations or the operations of our suppliers becomes scarce or the quality of that water deteriorates, we may incur increased production costs that we are unable or choose not to pass along to distributors through increased prices, or face production constraints, which could adversely affect our business and financial results. 21Table of ContentsWe depend on key personnel, the loss of whom could harm our business, and labor shortages, employee turnover and wage increases could significantly impact our operations.    The loss of the services and expertise of any key employee, or multiple members of senior management at the same time, could harm our business. Our future success depends on our ability to identify, attract and retain qualified personnel on a timely basis. If we were to experience turnover of any key employee or multiple members of senior management at the same time, or if a member or members of our senior management were to become ill or incapacitated, our stock price, our results of operations, our commercial and supply chain operations and our vendor or customer relationships could each be adversely impacted and such events may make recruiting for future management positions more difficult. The labor market for many of our employees is very competitive, and wages and compensation costs continue to increase. Our ability to attract and retain key talent has been, and may continue to be, impacted by challenges in the labor market, which has recently been experiencing wage inflation, labor shortages, and a continued shift toward remote work. In addition, labor costs are rising and our industry is experiencing a shortage of qualified workers. If we face labor shortages and/or increased labor costs as a result of increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover rates, or increases in employee benefits costs, our operating expenses could increase, which could negatively impact our growth and results of operations. Labor shortages, higher employee turnover rates and labor union organizing efforts could also lead to disruptions in our business, as discussed above. In addition, we must successfully integrate any new management personnel that we hire within our organization, or who join our organization as a result of an acquisition, in order to achieve our operating objectives, and changes in other key management positions may temporarily affect our financial performance and results of operations as new management becomes familiar with our business.Because of our reliance on third-party service providers and internal and outsourced systems for our information technology and certain other administrative functions, we could experience a disruption to our business.    We rely extensively on information services providers worldwide for our information technology functions including network, help desk, hardware and software configuration. Additionally, we rely on internal networks and information systems and other technology, including the internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement and supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments. We use information systems for certain human resource activities and to process our employee benefits, as well as to process financial information for internal and external reporting purposes and to comply with various reporting, legal and tax requirements. As information systems are critical to many of our operating activities, our business may be impacted by system shutdowns, service disruptions, obsolescence, or security threats or breaches. Furthermore, the importance of such information technology systems and networks has increased due to many of our employees working remotely as a result of our changing workplace dynamics. Additionally, if any of our significant service providers were to fail and we were unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner, we could be unable to properly administer our outsourced functions, which could disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial results. Poor investment performance of pension plan holdings and other factors impacting pension plan costs and contributions could unfavorably affect our business, liquidity and our financial results.    Our costs of providing defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on the plans' assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, exchange rate fluctuations, government regulation, court rulings or other changes in legal requirements, global equity prices, and our required and/or voluntary contributions to the plans. Although we comply with the minimum funding requirements, we have certain qualified pension plans with obligations which exceed the value of the plans' assets. These funding requirements also may require contributions even when there is no reported deficit. Without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans' assets, and depending upon the other factors as listed above, we could be required to fund the plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations (or the timing of such contributions) could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, credit rating, cost of borrowing, financial position and/or results of operations. Risks Related to Our Indebtedness, Capital Structure and Financial ConditionOur debt level subjects us to financial and operating risks, and the agreements governing such debt subject us to financial and operating covenants and restrictions.    Our indebtedness subjects us to various financial and operating covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions on priority indebtedness, leverage thresholds, liens, certain types of secured debt and certain types of sale lease-back transactions and transfers of assets, each of which may limit our flexibility in responding to our business needs. If we are not able to maintain compliance with stated financial covenants or if we breach other covenants in any debt agreement, we could be in default under such agreement or trigger a cross-default of other debt instruments. Such a default would adversely affect our credit ratings, may allow our creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness, and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. Our current and future debt levels and the terms of such debt could, among other things:     •make it more difficult to satisfy our obligations under the terms of our indebtedness;22Table of Contents•limit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, strategic opportunities, including acquisitions or other investments, to fund growth or for general corporate purposes, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity;    •limit our flexibility to plan for and adjust to changing business and market conditions, including successfully execute our Acceleration Plan, and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•require us to make unfavorable changes to our financing structure or require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to make interest and principal payments on our debt, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund strategic opportunities, including acquisitions or other investments, working capital, business activities, and other general corporate requirements; and•adversely impact our competitive position in the industry.In addition, certain of our current and future debt and derivative financial instruments have or, in the future, could have interest rates that are tied to reference interest rates. The volatility and availability of such reference rates are out of our control and the risks related thereto could have a material adverse effect on us.A deterioration in our credit rating could increase our borrowing rates or have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain future financing or refinance current debt.    Ratings agencies may downgrade our credit ratings below their current investment grade levels if we are, or are at risk of being, unable to meet our deleveraging commitments. Although we have publicly expressed our intention to maintain an investment grade debt rating, ratings are determined by third-party rating agencies and in some cases the events that may cause us to suffer a ratings downgrade are unpredictable and outside of our control, such as the macroeconomic climate or political instability. A credit ratings downgrade, particularly a downgrade below investment grade, could increase our costs of future borrowing, negatively impact our hedging instruments or sources of short-term liquidity and harm our ability to refinance our debt in the future on acceptable terms or access the capital markets. Deterioration of our credit rating may also raise governance issues within the Company and with external regulators. Default by, or failure of, one or more of our counterparty financial institutions could cause us to incur significant losses.    As part of our risk management activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, including, among others, forward contracts, commodity swap contracts and option contracts, with various financial institutions. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by, or failure of, counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to retrieve our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty's liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. We may incur impairments of the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.    In connection with various business combinations, we have historically allocated material amounts of the related purchase prices to goodwill and other intangible assets that are considered to have indefinite useful lives. For example, as a result of our acquisition in October 2016 of the remaining portion of MillerCoors LLC (which we refer to as the ""MillerCoors Acquisition""), we allocated approximately $6.3 billion and $7.6 billion to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively. These assets are tested for impairment at least annually, using estimates and assumptions affected by factors such as economic and industry conditions and changes in operating performance. Additionally, in conjunction with the brand impairment tests, we also reassess each brand's indefinite-life classification. Potential resulting charges from an impairment of goodwill or brand intangible, as well as reclassification of an indefinite-lived to a definite-lived brand intangible, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, the results of our 2022 annual goodwill impairment testing indicated that the fair value of our Americas reporting unit was below its carrying value. As a result, we recorded a partial impairment charge of $845.0 million within goodwill impairment, in our consolidated statements of operations during the fourth quarter of 2022. As of the year ended December 31, 2023, the EMEA&APAC reporting unit was fully impaired while the Americas reporting unit had $5.3 billion of goodwill remaining.Our most recent impairment analysis, conducted as of October 1, 2023, the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter, indicated that the carrying value of the Staropramen family of brands indefinite-lived intangible asset was determined to be in excess of its fair value such that a partial impairment charge of $160.7 million was recorded. In addition, as a result of the current year testing, it was determined that the Americas reporting unit and the Staropramen family of brands indefinite-lived intangible asset are at a heightened risk of future impairment in the event of significant unfavorable changes in the forecasted cash flows (including Company-specific risks like the performance of our above-premium transformation efforts, expansion in products beyond beer and overall market performance, including execution of strategic initiatives for the Staropramen family of brands, along with macroeconomic risks like the continued prolonged weakening of economic conditions and cost inflation, or 23Table of Contentssignificant unfavorable changes in income tax rates, environmental or other regulations, including interpretations thereof), terminal growth rates, market multiples and/or weighted-average cost of capital utilized in the discounted cash flow analyses. The fair values of our Americas reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible assets are sensitive to the aforementioned potential unfavorable changes that could have an adverse impact on future analyses. Any future impairment of the Americas reporting unit or our indefinite-lived intangible assets, or reclassification of indefinite-lived intangible assets to definite-lived, may result in material charges that could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, as evidenced by the charges incurred during the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022, as previously noted above. The testing of our goodwill for impairment is also predicated upon our determination of our reporting units. Any change to the conclusion of our reporting units or the aggregation of components within our reporting units could result in a different outcome to our annual impairment test. See Part II—Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, ""Critical Accounting Estimates"" and Part II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 6, ""Goodwill and Intangible Assets"" for additional information related to the results of our annual impairment testing.The estimates and assumptions on which our financial projections are based may prove to be inaccurate, which may cause our actual results to materially differ from such projections, which may adversely affect our future profitability, cash flows and stock price.    Our financial projections, including any sales or earnings guidance or outlook we may provide from time to time, are dependent on certain estimates and assumptions related to, among other things, our Acceleration Plan, category growth, development and launch of innovative new products, market share projections, product pricing, sales, volume and product mix, foreign exchange rates and volatility, tax rates, interest rates, commodity prices, distribution through truck versus railcar, cost savings, accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves, measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing business, fund internal growth, repurchase our stock, make acquisitions, invest in joint ventures, pay dividends and meet debt obligations. In addition, our ability to achieve our Acceleration Plan goals, and the anticipated benefits, are subject to various assumptions and uncertainties. There is no assurance that we will fully realize the anticipated financial impacts or execute successfully on our Acceleration Plan in the time frames we desire or at all. Our financial projections are based on historical experience and on various other estimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made, and our actual results may differ materially from our financial projections. Any material variation between our financial projections and our actual results may adversely affect our future profitability, cash flows and stock price.Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third PartiesWe rely on a small number of suppliers to obtain the input materials, in particular the packaging materials, we need to operate our business. The inability to obtain materials or disruptions at the facilities of our suppliers could unfavorably affect our ability to produce our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    We purchase certain types of input and other packaging materials, including aluminum cans and bottles, glass bottles, paperboard and carbon dioxide from a small number of suppliers. The demand for such input materials in the beverage industry has significantly increased, and there has been a shortage of capacity and increases in costs. In addition, consolidation of packaging materials suppliers has reduced local supply alternatives and increased risks of supply disruptions. The inability of any of these suppliers to meet our production requirements without sufficient time to develop an alternative source could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Additionally, if the financial condition of these suppliers deteriorates, our business and financial results could be adversely impacted. Our suppliers’ financial condition is affected in large part by conditions and events that are beyond our and their control, including: •competitive and general market conditions in the locations in which they operate; •the availability of capital and other financing resources on reasonable terms; •loss of major customers; •disruptions of operations that may be caused by strikes, work stoppages, labor unrest or natural disasters; •the increase in price of certain ingredients and raw materials used in our products; or •any of the foregoing, among other things, as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict or otherwise. Termination or changes of one or more manufacturer, distribution or production agreements, or issues caused by our dependence on the parties to these agreements, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    We manufacture and distribute products of other beverage companies through various joint venture, licensing, distribution, contract brewing or other similar arrangements, such as our agreement to produce, import, market, distribute and sell certain Heineken brands in Canada, and our arrangements with ABI to brew and distribute Beck's, Stella Artois, and Lowenbrau and to distribute Hoegaarden, Leffe, and Corona in Central Europe. We also have agreements with Asahi for the production and import of Pilsner Urquell and Peroni Nastro Azurro into the U.S. under a perpetual royalty-free license. In 24Table of Contentsaddition, we also have authorizations from The Coca-Cola Company that grant us the right to produce, market, sell and distribute Topo Chico Hard Seltzer and Simply Spiked branded products in the U.S. and Canada, and Peace Hard Tea branded products in the U.S. These agreements have varying expiration dates and performance criteria, with several agreements approaching expiration in the near future. The non-renewal or loss of one or more of these arrangements, because of failure to perform or failure to agree to terms of an extension, or as a result of industry consolidation or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. As part of our efforts to streamline operations and to manage capital investments, we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers’ orders on a timely basis. The ability of these third parties to perform is largely outside of our control. If one or more of these parties experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase, we may have to seek alternative providers, which could increase our costs or prevent or delay the delivery of our products. Further, our business includes various joint venture and industry agreements which standardize parts of the supply chain system. An example includes our warehousing and customer delivery systems in Canada organized under joint venture agreements with other brewers. Any negative change in these agreements or material terms within these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Risks Related to Legal Matters, Governmental Regulations and our International OperationsUnfavorable outcomes of legal or regulatory matters may adversely affect our business and financial condition and damage our reputation.    We are from time to time involved in or subject to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings or matters related to our business, the alcohol industry in general, our advertising and marketing practices, product claims, product labeling and ingredients, our intellectual property rights, alleged infringement or misappropriation by us of intellectual property rights of others, tax, environmental, privacy, insurance, ERISA and employment matters. Such matters, even those that are ultimately non-meritorious, can be complex, costly, and highly disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and other key personnel, and may generate adverse publicity that damages our reputation or brand image. The assessment of the outcome of such matters, including our potential liability, if any, is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events that are not within our control and are based on the information available to management at that time. The outcome of such matters, including amounts ultimately received or paid upon judgment or settlement, may differ materially from management’s outlook or estimates, including any amounts accrued in the financial statements. Actual outcomes, including judgments, awards, settlements or orders, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flows and damage our corporate reputation and our brands.    Our operations in developing and emerging markets expose us to additional risks, which could harm our business and financial results.    We continue to operate in developing and emerging markets. In certain of these markets, we have limited operating experience and may not succeed. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this report, our operations in these markets expose us to additional heightened risks, including: •changes in local political, economic, social and labor conditions; •restrictions on foreign ownership and investments; •repatriation of cash earned in countries outside the U.S.; •import and export requirements; •increased costs to ensure compliance with complex foreign laws and regulations;•currency exchange rate fluctuations; •a less developed and less certain legal and regulatory environment, which among other things can create uncertainty with regard to liability issues; •longer payment cycles, increased credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud; •increased exposure to global disease outbreaks or pandemics; and •other challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences.25Table of ContentsIn addition, as a global company, we are subject to foreign and U.S. laws and regulations designed to combat governmental corruption, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the U.K. Proceeds of Crime Act. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, each of which could have a materially negative effect on our reputation, brands and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, there can be no assurance that our employees, business partners or agents will not violate our policies and procedures.Changes to the regulation of the distribution systems for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results.    Many countries in which we operate regulate the distribution of alcohol products and if those regulations were changed, it could alter our business practices and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, in the U.S. market, there is a three-tier distribution system that governs the sale of malt beverage products. That system, requiring separation of manufacturers, distributors and retailers, dates back to the repeal of prohibition and is periodically subject to legal challenges. To the extent that such challenges are successful and change the three-tier system, including through the expansion of e-commerce and direct-to-consumer offerings, such changes could have a material adverse effect on our Americas segment results of operations. Further, in Canada, our products are required to be distributed through each province's respective provincial liquor board. Additionally, in certain Canadian provinces, we rely on our joint venture arrangements with BRI and BDL to distribute our products via retail outlets that are mandated and regulated by provincial government regulators. BRI owns and operates commercial retail outlets, known as The Beer Store, in Ontario, and BDL facilitates the distribution of our products in the western Canadian provinces. If provincial regulation should change, the costs to adjust our distribution methods could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Our consolidated financial statements are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, most significantly the Canadian dollar and the European operating currencies such as, Euro, British Pound, Czech Koruna, Serbian Dinar, New Romanian Leu, Bulgarian Lev and Hungarian Forint.    We hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in different currencies, most significantly in Canada and throughout Europe. Because our financial statements are presented in USD, we must translate our assets, liabilities, income and expenses into USD. Increases and decreases in the value of the USD will affect, perhaps adversely, the value of these items in our financial statements, even if their local currency value has not changed. Additionally, we are exposed to currency transaction risks related to transactions denominated in currencies other than one of the functional currencies of our operating entities, such as the purchase of certain raw material inputs or capital expenditures, as well as sales transactions and debt issuances or other incurred obligations. Further, certain actions by the government of any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our results and financial position. To the extent that we fail to adequately manage these risks through our risk management policies intended to protect our exposure to currency movements, which may affect our operations, including if our hedging arrangements do not effectively or completely hedge changes in foreign currency rates, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. For instance, the strengthening of the USD against the Canadian dollar, European currencies and various other global currencies would adversely impact our USD reported results due to the impact on foreign currency translation.Changes in tax, environmental, trade or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing, trade and other regulations could cause volatility or have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Our business is highly regulated by national, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in various jurisdictions regarding such matters as tariffs, licensing requirements, trade and pricing practices, taxation, labeling, advertising, promotion and marketing practices, relationships with distributors, environmental matters, packaging material regulations, ingredient regulations, unclaimed property and other matters. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent re-evaluation, varying interpretations and political debate and inquiries from government regulators charged with their enforcement, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Future changes to U.S. or foreign trade policies, impositions of new or increased tariffs, other trade restrictions or other government actions, including any government shutdown, foreign currency fluctuations, including devaluations and fear of exposure to or actual impacts of a widespread disease outbreak, may lead to the continuation or escalation of such risks and uncertainty. 26Table of ContentsFurthermore, changes to existing tax laws or the adoption of new tax policies, regulations, guidance or laws, particularly in the U.S., U.K. and Canada, could have a material adverse impact to our effective tax rate, future cash tax liabilities and our financial results in general. In addition, the current economic and political environment, including the focus on corporate tax reform, anti-base erosion rules and tax transparency, may result in significant tax law changes in the numerous jurisdictions in which we operate and could have a material adverse impact to our effective tax rate, future cash tax liabilities and our financial results in general. In August 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (""IRA""), which included among other provisions, a 15% minimum tax on ""adjusted financial statement income"" and became effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2023. Recently, intergovernmental organizations such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (""OECD"") and European Union (""EU"") have proposed changes to the existing tax laws of member countries. For instance, the OECD has introduced model rules for a new 15% global minimum tax framework, as well as a proposal on the allocation of profit among tax jurisdictions in which companies operate. In December 2022, the EU member states agreed to incorporate the 15% global minimum tax into their respective domestic laws effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 31, 2023. Additionally, several non-EU countries, including the U.K., have recently proposed and/or adopted legislation consistent with the OECD global minimum tax framework. These tax laws and regulations could adversely impact our financial results beyond fiscal year 2024. Continued economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, may make resolving tax disputes more difficult, and prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to enforcement activities, as well as legislative investigation and inquiry, which could also result in changes in tax policies or prior tax rulings. The final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation can differ from our historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse effect on our financial performance.Additionally, modifications of laws and policies governing foreign trade and investment, including trade agreements and tariffs such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the European Union-United Kingdom Trade and Cooperating Agreement, or aluminum tariffs, could adversely affect our supply chain, business and results of operations. For example, in June 2018, U.S. tariffs on aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and EU went into effect (though the U.S. lifted the aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico in May 2019), which created volatility in the price of aluminum in the U.S. and increased the price of aluminum used in some of our product packaging. Continued imposition of U.S. aluminum tariffs, the implementation of additional tariffs and retaliatory tariffs from trade partners or related uncertainties could further increase the cost of certain of our imported materials, thereby adversely affecting our profitability. In addition, the European Union-United Kingdom Trade and Cooperating Agreement became effective in May 2021 and resulted in certain disruptions in trade and the movement of goods, including prolonged transportation delays, which affected our ability to source raw materials and packaging for our products as well as our ability to import and export products.Furthermore, various jurisdictions have adopted, or may seek to adopt, additional product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the availability of our beverages relating to perceived adverse health consequences of some of our beverages. If additional or more severe requirements of this type are imposed on one or more of our beverages under current or future laws or regulations, they could inhibit sales of such beverages in such jurisdictions. In addition, we cannot predict whether our beverages will become subject to increased rules and regulations regarding labeling or warnings which, if enacted, could increase our costs or adversely impact sales.In addition, a number of governmental authorities, both in the U.S. and abroad, have considered, and are expected to consider, legislation aimed at packaging reducing the amount of plastic waste. Programs have included recommendations for extended producer responsibility, banning certain types of products, mandating certain rates of recycling and/or the use of recycled materials, imposing deposits or excise taxes on packaging material, and requiring retailers or manufacturers to take back packaging used for their products. Such legislation, as well as voluntary initiatives, aimed at reducing the level of plastic wastes, could reduce the demand for certain of our products that contain plastic packaging, result in greater costs for manufacturers of plastic products or otherwise impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, changes in applicable environmental regulations, including increased or additional regulations to discourage the use of particular materials (or encourage or mandate the use of other materials) may result in increased compliance costs, increased costs, capital expenditures, incremental investments and other financial obligations for us and our business partners, which could affect our profitability. We may not be able to implement price increases for our products to cover any increased costs, and any price increases we do implement may result in lower sales volumes.The government(s) of each country in which we sell our products, including state and local jurisdictions in the U.S., levies excise taxes at varying rates. Additionally, U.S. governmental entities also levy taxes and may require bonds to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Increases in excise taxes, and such compliance taxes and bonds, could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.27Table of ContentsFailure to comply with existing laws and regulations or changes in these laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof, specifically tax and environmental laws or any other laws or regulations could result in the loss, revocation or suspension of our licenses, permits or approvals and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of, and potential future developments in, complex domestic and international tax laws and regulations, the amount and timing of future taxable income and the interaction of such laws and regulations among jurisdictions. Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded.Risks Related to Acquisitions and Joint VenturesRisks associated with operating our joint ventures may materially adversely affect our business and financial results.    We have entered into several joint ventures, including our joint ventures with Ball Corporation (i.e., Rocky Mountain Metal Container), and with Owens-Brockway Glass Container Inc. (i.e., Rocky Mountain Bottle Company), for a portion of our aluminum and glass packaging supply in the U.S., respectively. We have also entered into a joint venture with The Yuengling Company LLC to expand the distribution of Yuengling beer in the western U.S. We also have a joint venture in the U.K. regarding the production and distribution of Cobra beer. Additionally, in certain Canadian provinces, we rely on joint venture agreements with BRI and BDL to distribute our products via retail outlets that are mandated and regulated by provincial government regulators. As previously referenced, BRI owns and operates commercial retail outlets, known as The Beer Store, in Ontario, and BDL facilitates the distribution of our products in the western Canadian provinces. We may enter into additional joint ventures in the future. Our joint venture partners may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or with the goals of the joint venture. In addition, we compete against our joint venture partners in certain of our other markets. Disagreements with our business partners may impede our ability to maximize the benefits of our partnerships. Our joint venture arrangements may require us, among other matters, to pay certain costs or to make certain capital investments or to seek our joint venture partner's consent to take certain actions. In addition, our joint venture partners may be unable or unwilling to meet their economic or other obligations under the operative documents, or may become insolvent or file for bankruptcy protection and we may be required to either fulfill those obligations alone to ensure the ongoing success of a joint venture or to dissolve and liquidate a joint venture. Failure to successfully identify, complete or integrate attractive acquisitions and joint ventures into our existing operations could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.    We have made a number of acquisitions and entered into several strategic joint ventures. In order to compete in the consolidating global brewing and beverage industry, we anticipate that we may, from time to time, in the future acquire additional businesses like the Blue Run Spirits, Inc (""Blue Run"") acquisition in the third quarter of 2023 or enter into additional joint ventures that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our business. Potential risks associated with acquisitions and joint ventures could include, among other things: •our ability to identify attractive acquisitions and joint ventures; •our ability to offer potential acquisition targets and joint venture partners' competitive transaction terms; •our ability to raise capital on reasonable terms to finance attractive acquisitions and joint ventures; •our ability to realize the benefits or cost savings that we expect to realize as a result of the acquisition or joint venture; •diversion of management's attention; •our ability to successfully integrate our businesses with the business of the acquired company; •motivating, recruiting and retaining key employees; •conforming standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures among our company and the acquired company; •consolidating and streamlining sales, marketing and corporate operations; •potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies; •potential exposure to unknown or future liabilities or costs that affect the markets in which acquired companies or joint ventures operate; •reputational or other damage due to the conduct of a joint venture partner or the prior conduct of an acquired company; •loss of key employees and customers of an acquired company; and 28Table of Contents•managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations following completion of an acquisition or entry into a joint venture. Additional Risks Related to our Americas SegmentOur U.S. business is highly dependent on independent distributors to sell our products, with no assurance that these distributors will effectively sell our products, and distributor consolidation in the U.S. could harm our business and financial results.    We sell nearly all of our products, including all of our imported products, in the U.S. to independent distributors for resale to retail outlets. These independent distributors are entitled to exclusive territories and protected from termination by state statutes and regulations. Consequently, if we are not allowed, or are unable under acceptable terms or at all, to replace unproductive or inefficient distributors, our business, financial position and results of operation may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Further, in recent years, there has been a consolidation of independent distributors, resulting in distributors with increased leverage over suppliers due to the distributor's share of the supplier business, exclusive territorial appointments and regulatory protection of distribution agreements. We have limited ability to influence decisions regarding distributor consolidation, which, regardless of size, carries a risk of decreased investment in service and local marketing in the interest of paying down the leverage required to fund a transaction. Consolidation among distributors could create a more challenging competitive landscape for our products and could hinder the distribution and sale of our products. There is a risk that consolidation of distributors could further increase due to potential changes in tax laws in the markets in which we operate. This could negatively impact sales of certain growth driver products, such as hard seltzers and ready to drink beverages, and increase prices. Our unique portfolio may require more brand building than our competitors, which could be adversely affected in the event of distributor consolidation. Changes in distributors' strategies, including a reduction in the number of brands they carry, may adversely affect our growth, business, financial results and market share.Government mandated changes to the retail distribution model resulting from new regulations may have a material adverse effect on our Canada business.    The Province of Ontario and Molson Canada 2005, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of our Company, Labatt Brewing Company Limited, Sleeman Breweries Ltd. (collectively, the ""Representative Owners""), and Brewers Retail Inc., operating under the name ""The Beer Store"" (""TBS""), are parties to a Master Framework Agreement (""MFA"") that dictates the terms of the beer distribution and retail systems in Ontario. The initial term of the Master Framework Agreement does not expire until December 31, 2025, and the MFA contains a provision requiring two-year advance notice of the government's intention to not renew the MFA. In December 2023, the Province of Ontario notified the Representative Owners and TBS that it would not be renewing the MFA after the initial term of the MFA expires on December 31, 2025. The Province of Ontario simultaneously announced a set of non-binding Key Principles agreed upon between the Province of Ontario, the Representative Owners, and TBS, concerning the intended features of the future marketplace for beer distribution and retail systems in the Province of Ontario to be introduced no later than January 1, 2026. Under the Key Principles, TBS will continue its retail operations and will continue to be the primary distributor of beer in the Province of Ontario at least through 2031. The Key Principles also state grocery stores, convenience stores, gas stations, and big-box retailers in the Province of Ontario will be able to apply for licenses to sell beer, wine, cider, and ready-to-drink cocktails starting in 2026. The impacts of the Key Principles are still being analyzed and could have a negative impact on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of our Americas Segment. Indemnities provided to the purchaser of our previous interest in the Cervejarias Kaiser Brasil S.A. (""Kaiser"") business in Brazil could result in future cash outflows and statement of operations charges.    In 2006, we sold our previous ownership interest in Kaiser, which was held by our Canadian business, to FEMSA Cerveza S.A. de C.V. (""FEMSA""). The terms of the sale agreement require us to indemnify FEMSA for exposures related to certain tax, civil and labor contingencies and certain purchased tax credits. The ultimate resolution of these claims is not under our control. These indemnity obligations are recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets; however, we could incur future statement of operations charges due to changes to our estimates or changes in our assessment of probability of loss on these items as well as due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Due to the uncertainty involved in the ultimate outcome and timing of these contingencies, significant adjustments to the carrying value of our indemnity liabilities and corresponding statement of operations charges/credits could result in the future. Additional Risks Related to our EMEA&APAC SegmentEconomic trends and intense competition in European markets could unfavorably affect our profitability.    Our European businesses have been, and, in the future may be, adversely affected by conditions in the global financial markets and general economic and political conditions, as well as a weakening of their respective currencies versus the U.S. dollar, in each case, in addition to the other impacts of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Additionally, we face intense competition in certain of our European markets, particularly with respect to pricing, which could lead to reduced sales or profitability. In particular, the on-going focus by large competitors in Europe to drive increased market share through aggressive pricing strategies could 29Table of Contentsadversely affect our sales and results of operations. We may also face pressures resulting from a reduction in disposable incomes of consumers to spend on our products due to inflation, recessionary conditions and an increase in the cost of energy, primarily in countries located in central and eastern Europe, which could unfavorably affect our profitability. In addition, in recent years, beer volume sales in Europe have been shifting from on-premise, such as pubs and restaurants, to off-premise, such as retail stores, for the industry as a whole. Margins in sales to off-premise customers tend to be lower than margins from sales to on-premise customers, and, as a result, continuation or acceleration of this trend could further adversely affect our profitability.Risks Related to Ownership of our Class B Common StockIf Pentland and the Coors Trust do not agree on a matter submitted to our stockholders or if a super-majority of the Board do not agree on certain actions, generally the matter will not be approved, even if beneficial to us or favored by other stockholders or a majority of the Board.    Pentland Securities (1981) Inc. (""Pentland"") (a company controlled by the Molson family and related parties) and the Adolph Coors, Jr. Trust (the ""Coors Trust"") (a trust controlled by the Coors family and related parties), which together control more than 90% of our Class A common stock and Class A exchangeable shares, have a voting trust agreement through which they have combined their voting power over the shares of our Class A common stock and the Class A exchangeable shares that they own. If these two stockholders do not agree to vote in favor of a matter submitted to a stockholder vote (other than the election of directors), the voting trustees are required to vote all of the Class A common stock and Class A exchangeable shares deposited in the voting trust against the matter. There is no other mechanism in the voting trust agreement to resolve a potential deadlock between these stockholders. Therefore, if either Pentland or the Coors Trust is unwilling to vote in favor of a proposal that is subject to a stockholder vote, we would be unable to implement the proposal even if the Board, management or other stockholders believe the proposal is beneficial to us. Similarly, our bylaws require the authorization of a super-majority (two-thirds) of the Board to take certain transformational actions. Thus, it is possible that our Company will not be authorized to take action even if it is supported by a simple majority of the Board.The interests of the controlling stockholders may differ from those of other stockholders and could prevent our Company from making certain decisions or taking certain actions that would be in the best interest of the other stockholders.    Our Class B common stock has fewer voting rights than our Class A common stock and holders of our Class A common stock have the ability to effectively control or have a significant influence over certain of our actions requiring stockholder approval, which could have a material adverse effect on Class B stockholders. See Part II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 14, ""Stockholders' Equity"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding voting rights of Class A and Class B stockholders.    Shareholder activism efforts or unsolicited offers from a third-party could cause a material disruption to our business and financial results.    We may be subject to various legal and business challenges due to actions instituted by shareholder activists or unsolicited third-party offers. Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of shareholder activism may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business or other instability and may affect our relationships with vendors, customers, prospective and current employees and others. Proposed or future laws and regulations may increase the chance we become the target of shareholder activist campaigns, including ESG-related actions. If shareholder activist campaigns are initiated against us, our response to such actions could be costly and time-consuming, which could divert the attention and resources of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategies, which could harm our business, negatively impact our stock price, and have an adverse effect on our business and financial results"

Investors should carefully consider the following risk factors and the other information contained within this report. The risks set forth below are those that management believes are most likely to have a material adverse effect on us. Investors are encouraged to read each risk factor as related and interconnected to the other risk factors set forth in this section. However, the risks set forth below are not a comprehensive description of the risks facing our Company. We may also be subject to other risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial but may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods. Investors should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk has not already materialized. If the following risks or uncertainties, individually or in combination, actually occur, they may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations or prospects. See also ""Cautionary Statement Pursuant to Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995."" Risks Related to our Company and OperationsDeterioration of general economic, political, credit and/or capital market conditions, including those caused by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict or other geopolitical tensions, could adversely affect our financial performance, our ability to grow or sustain our business, financial condition and results of operations, and our ability to access the capital markets.    We compete around the world in various geographic regions and product markets. Global economic and political conditions affect our business and the businesses of our customers, suppliers and consumers. Recessions, economic downturns, price instability, inflation, slowing economic growth and social and political instability in the markets where we compete could negatively affect our revenues and financial performance, and adversely impact our ability to grow or sustain our business. For example, current macroeconomic and political instability caused by the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine (which we refer to as the ""Russia-Ukraine conflict""), global supply chain disruptions and inflation have adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our business and financial results. Specifically, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, has adversely affected the global economy, and the geopolitical tensions and conflicts it has generated and continues to generate negatively impact our operations. It has resulted in heightened economic sanctions from the U.S., the U.K., the European Union and the international community. As a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, in 2022 we suspended all exports of any MCBC brands to Russia and we terminated the license to produce any of our brands in Russia, which may expose us to adverse legal proceedings. Even though our sales in Russia have 14Table of Contentshistorically been limited, representing less than 0.2% of our 2021 consolidated net sales and less than 1% of our 2021 EMEA&APAC net sales, and we have no physical assets in Russia, the effect of the Russia-Ukraine conflict due to the widespread impact  has had and could continue to have a material adverse outcome on our business, financial condition, results of operations, supply chain, availability of critical supplies, intellectual property, partners, customers or employees. Further escalation of geopolitical tensions related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, including increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade, could result in, among other things, broader impacts that expand into other markets, cyberattacks, energy supply availability shortages, supply chain and logistics disruptions, lower consumer demand, and volatility in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and financial markets, any of which may adversely affect our business and supply chain. Similar geopolitical tensions and political conflicts could adversely impact our employees, financial performance and global operations, including by, among other things, jeopardizing the safety of our employees and facilities, disrupting our and our partners’ production, supply chain and logistics and communications, and causing market volatility, which could adversely impact consumer demand and our sales. More broadly, there could be additional negative impacts to our financial results if the Russia-Ukraine conflict worsens, including, among other potential impacts, economic recessions in certain neighboring countries or globally due to inflationary pressures, including with respect to food, energy and supply chain cost increases or shortages, or the geographic proximity of the conflict relative to the rest of Europe. In addition, the effects of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict could amplify or affect many of our other risks described elsewhere in Part I, Item 1A, ""Risk Factors
"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.In addition, the capital and credit markets provide us with liquidity to operate and grow our business beyond the liquidity that operating cash flows provide, which can vary from period to period. A global or regional economic downturn or disruption of the credit markets could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets necessary for our operations and to execute our strategic plan. If our access to capital on terms commercially acceptable to us were to become significantly constrained, or if costs of capital increased significantly, then our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. Further, continued disruption and declines in the global economy have impacted and could continue to impact our customers' liquidity and capital resources and therefore our ability to collect, or the timeliness of collection of our accounts receivable from them, which may have a material adverse impact on our performance, cash flows and capital resources. Our operations are dependent on the global supply chain and face significant exposure to changes in commodity and other input prices, and impacts of supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures could adversely impact our operating results.    We depend on the effectiveness of our supply chain management to assure reliable and sufficient supply of quality products. Our business has been, and may continue to be, impacted by supply chain constraints, including as a result of raw materials and ingredient shortages, longer lead times, port congestion and increased freight costs caused, in part, by the coronavirus pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the uncertain economic environment worldwide. These supply chain constraints also put significant inflationary pressures on commodity and other input prices. In addition, current proposed or future governmental policies may increase the risk of inflation, which could further increase the costs of raw materials and other components for our business. We use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials, some of which are purchased through supply contracts with third parties, to produce our products, including barley, malted barley, hops, corn, other various starches, water and packaging materials, including aluminum cans and bottles, glass and polyethylene terephthalate containers as well as cardboard and other paper products. We also use a significant amount of diesel fuel, natural gas, electricity and carbon dioxide in our operations. The supply and price of these raw materials and commodities can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including market demand, inflation, alternative sources for suppliers, global geopolitical events, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict (especially as to their impact on energy supply prices in general, including crude oil prices and the resulting impact on diesel fuel prices), global or regional disease outbreaks or pandemics, such as the coronavirus pandemic, trade agreements among producing and consuming nations, governmental regulations (including tariffs), frosts, droughts and other weather conditions, changes in precipitation patterns, the frequency of extreme weather events, economic factors affecting growth decisions, plant diseases, theft and industry surcharges and other practices. Similarly, if the costs of goods continue to increase, our suppliers may seek price increases from us. If we are unable to mitigate the impact of these matters through customer price increases, cost savings to offset cost increases, hedging arrangements, or other measures, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. If our competitors maintain or substantially lower their prices, we may lose customers or mark down prices. Our profitability may be impacted by prices that do not offset the inflationary pressures, which may impact our gross margins. Even if we are able to raise the prices of our products, we may not be able to sustain such price increases and consumers might react negatively to such price increases, which could have a material adverse effect on, among other things, our brand, reputation and sales. Temporary or sustained price increases may also lead to a decrease in demand for our products as competitors may not adjust their prices or consumers may decide not to pay higher prices for our products, which could lead to a decline in sales volume and loss of market share. Our projections may not accurately predict the volume impact of price increases, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 15Table of ContentsEven though our businesses are working to alleviate supply chain constraints through various measures, such as sourcing from additional suppliers and using alternative delivery methods or materials, we are unable to predict the impact of these constraints on the timing of revenue and operating costs of our business in the near future. Packaging material supply shortages and supply chain constraints, including cost inflation, have impacted and could continue to negatively impact our ability to meet increased demand in off-premise channels or particular packages which in turn could impact our net sales and market share. In addition, in 2021 and 2022, shortages of raw materials and disruption to the global supply chain negatively impacted sales, costs and inventory availability and may continue to have a negative impact on future results and profitability. In the U.S., we are exposed to variability in the market price of a regional premium differential (which we refer to as “the Midwest Premium”) charged by industry participants to deliver aluminum from the smelter to the manufacturing facility. This premium differential fluctuates in relation to several conditions, including the supply of and demand for aluminum in a particular region, associated transportation costs and warehouse financing transactions, which limit the amount of physical aluminum available to consumers and increases the price differential as a result. During periods of greater volatility in the Midwest Premium, the variability in our cost of goods sold can also increase. In addition to impacting the prices of raw materials, a constant or periodic change in the Midwest Premium differentials may impact our end consumers as we must either pass on the increased costs to our consumers or decrease our profit margins. Increases in the Midwest Premium, or the inability to pass through any fluctuation in aluminum prices or regional premiums to our end consumers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Geopolitical tensions, the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and related governmental and port facility actions have caused delays in shipments of our products and supplies. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we and our suppliers experienced disruptions that impacted our supply chain and increased global lead-time for our products, including port congestion, temporary closures and worker shortages. Further, we distribute our products and receive raw materials primarily by truck or rail. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, higher transportation and costs despite our efforts to reduce the impact of these higher costs. Higher transportation costs are a result of increased fuel and labor prices and freight costs, as well as reduced trucking capacity due to driver shortages. In addition, global inflation has contributed to already higher incremental freight costs and such inflation may continue to result in higher freight costs. Reduced availability of trucking or rail capacity may also result from an increase in competition for transportation of products and has caused, and could continue to cause, us to incur unanticipated expenses, such as using the spot market. Any efforts to pay spot market prices, which are higher than they have been in many years, or similar methods could adversely impact our business and financial results. Failure to adequately produce and timely ship our products to customers could lead to lost potential revenue, failure to meet customer demand, strained relationships with customers, including wholesalers, and diminished brand loyalty. Similarly, failure to adequately produce and timely ship our products to customers and consumers could lead to lost potential revenue, failure to meet consumer demand, strained relationships with customers and consumers and diminished brand loyalty.Weak, or weakening of, economic, social or other conditions in the markets in which we do business, including cost inflation and reductions in discretionary consumer spending, could adversely impact demand for our products or cause consumers to suffer financial hardship, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Beer consumption in some of our markets could be closely tied to general economic conditions and a significant portion of our portfolio consists of premium and above premium brands. Difficult macroeconomic conditions in our markets, such as further decreases in per capita income and level of disposable income driven by increases in inflation, energy costs, income (and other) taxes and the cost of living, increased and prolonged unemployment or a further decline in consumer confidence, in each case, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict or other geopolitical tension, as well as limited or significantly reduced points of access of our product, political or economic instability or other country-specific factors, could continue to have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products. For example, under difficult or deteriorating economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products by shifting away from our premium and above premium products to lower-priced products offered by us or other companies or by shifting to off-premise from on-premise consumption, negatively impacting our net sales and margins. A significant portion of our consolidated net sales are concentrated in the U.S., Canada and countries in Europe, which represent the majority of net sales within our Americas and EMEA&APAC segments. Therefore, unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, such as inflationary pressures, a recession or continued slowed economic growth in the U.S., Canada or countries in Europe, could negatively affect consumer demand for our product in these important markets, which consequently, may negatively affect the results of operations in our Americas and EMEA&APAC segments. Softer consumer demand for our products could reduce our profitability and would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Loss, operational disruptions or closure of a major brewery or other key facility, including those of our suppliers, due to unforeseen or catastrophic events or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Our business could be interrupted and our financial results could be materially adversely impacted by physical risks such as 16Table of Contentsearthquakes, fires, hurricanes, floods, acts of war, terrorist attacks, cyberattacks and other disruptions in information systems, such as the March 2021 cybersecurity incident, disease outbreaks or pandemics, such as the coronavirus pandemic, and other natural disasters or catastrophic events that damage, disrupt or destroy one of our breweries or key facilities or the key facilities of our significant suppliers. If any of our breweries or key facilities or the key facilities of our significant suppliers experience a significant operational disruption or catastrophic loss, it could delay, disrupt or reduce production, shipments and revenue, and result in potentially significant expenses to repair or replace these properties. Such significant disruptions could be due to, among other things:•the loss or disruption of the timely availability of adequate supplies of essential raw materials for us and our suppliers, including single-source suppliers; •our ability to integrate new suppliers into our operations;•material financial issues facing our suppliers, such as bankruptcy or similar proceedings; •transportation and logistics challenges, including as a result of port and border closures and other governmental restrictions and the availability and capacity of shipping channels as customers may shift to increased online shopping; •the loss or disruption of other manufacturing, distribution and supply capabilities; •the loss or disruption of the energy sources or suppliers in Europe due to supply shortages as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, including price increases in the energy market; •labor shortages, strikes or work stoppages; •the loss or disruption of the supply of carbon dioxide gas; •acts of war and terrorism•illness to our employees or their families or governmental restrictions on such employees' ability to travel or perform necessary business functions; or •as a result of the need for us or our suppliers to operate our respective businesses with substantial modifications to employee travel and employee work locations. We experienced certain of the foregoing risks and losses in connection with the March 2021 cybersecurity incident and the coronavirus pandemic. Additionally, certain catastrophes are not covered by our general insurance policies, which could result in significant unrecoverable losses. Our business and results of operations could also be adversely impacted by under-investment in physical assets or production capacity, including contract brewing and effect on the priority of our brands if production capacity is limited. Further, significant excess capacity at any of our breweries as a result of increased efficiencies in our supply chain process or continued volume declines could result in under-utilization of our assets, which could lead to excess overhead expenses or additional costs incurred associated with the closure of one or more of our facilities. For example, as part of a strategic review of our supply chain network, certain breweries and bottling lines were closed in recent years, and we have incurred brewery closure costs, including charges associated with the closure of the Irwindale brewery in 2020, which was subsequently sold to Pabst Brewing Company, LLC in the fourth quarter of 2020. We regularly review our supply chain network to ensure that our supply chain capacity is aligned with the needs of the business. Such reviews could potentially result in further closures and the related costs could be material.Cybersecurity incidents impacting our information systems, and violations of data privacy laws and regulations could disrupt our business operations and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.    Our information systems may be the target of cyber-attacks or other security breaches, which, if successful, could, among other things, disrupt our operations, applications and services, cause the loss of key business, employee, customer or vendor information, cause us to breach our legal, regulatory or contractual obligations, prevent us from accessing or relying upon critical business records, cause reputational damage, or impact the costs or ability to obtain adequate insurance coverage. These incidents may result from human errors, equipment failure, or fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties. The risk of cyber threats or cyberattacks increases as we rely more on digital partners, including supply-chain partners integrated into our business, who may also be the target of cyberattacks or other security breaches. If our information systems suffer severe disruption, damage, or shutdown we could experience delays and disruptions in our business, including brewery operations, production and shipments and delays in reporting our financial results, such as those we experienced with the March 2021 cybersecurity incident, which could adversely affect our cash flows, competitive position, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. A breach of our information systems, such as the March 2021 cybersecurity incident could subject us to litigation, including class action or derivative lawsuits, regulatory fines, and penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results or reputation. We have seen an increase in the number of cyberattacks due, in part, to the large number 17Table of Contentsof our employees that are working and accessing our technology infrastructure remotely because of shifts in working arrangements primarily as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. In addition, the March 2021 cybersecurity incident may embolden other individuals or groups to target our information systems and impact the costs or ability for us to obtain adequate insurance coverages moving forward. Furthermore, continued geopolitical turmoil, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, has heightened the risk of cyberattacks.We expend significant financial resources to protect against cyber threats and cyberattacks. We may be required to incur further costs to alleviate problems and remedy damage caused by physical, electronic and cybersecurity breaches, including the potential for increased ongoing expenses related to the March 2021 cybersecurity incident, and to address possible increased information system attacks as a result of the incident, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. As techniques used to breach security are growing in frequency and sophistication and are generally not recognized until launched against a target, we may not be able to implement security measures in a timely manner or, if and when implemented, these measures could be circumvented regardless of our expenditures and protection efforts. We could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, we incurred certain incremental one-time costs of $2.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 related to consultants, experts and data recovery efforts, net of insurance recoveries. Although we attempt to vigorously monitor and mitigate against cyber risks, including through leveraging multi-sourced threat intelligence and investing in new technologies, we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyberattacks or other cybersecurity incidents.Misuse, leakage or falsification of information could result in a violation of data privacy laws and regulations, including but not limited to, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, California Privacy Rights Act, which took effect on January 1, 2023, or the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, which took effect on January 1, 2023, damage our reputation and credibility or expose us to increased risk of lawsuits, loss of existing or potential future customers and/or increases in our security costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information and may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight or consumers may avoid our brands due to negative publicity. In the event of a breach resulting in loss of data, such as personally identifiable information or other such data protected by data privacy or other laws, even if encrypted, we may be liable for damages, fines and penalties for such losses under applicable regulatory frameworks despite not handling the data. Further, the regulatory framework around data custody, data privacy and breaches varies by jurisdiction and is an evolving area of law. We may not be able to limit our liability or damages in the event of such a loss.The success of our business relies heavily on brand image, reputation, product quality and protection of intellectual property.    It is important that we maintain and enhance the image and reputation of our existing brands and products, including our corporate purpose, mission and values. Concerns about product quality, even when unsubstantiated, could be harmful to our image and the reputation of our brands and products. While we have quality control programs in place, in the event we or our third-party manufacturers experience an issue with product quality or if any of our products become unsafe or unfit for consumption, are misbranded or cause injury, we may experience recalls or liability in addition to business disruption which could further negatively impact our brand image and reputation, negatively affect our sales and cause us to incur additional costs. A widespread product recall, multiple product recalls or a significant product liability judgment could cause our products to be unavailable for a period of time, which could further reduce consumer demand and brand equity. We also could be exposed to lawsuits relating to product liability, marketing or sales practices or intellectual property infringement. Our brand image and reputation may also be difficult to protect due to less oversight and control as a result of outsourcing some of our operations internationally or entering new or different product lines. If we are unable to address and uphold our plans with respect to our ESG initiatives or actions by and attitudes of regulators and the public health community, our image and brand equity may deteriorate, which may be difficult to combat or reverse and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, because our brands carry family names or we may partner with celebrities or other famous sponsors, personal activities by certain members of the Molson or Coors families, our promotional partners or business partners that harm their public image or reputation could also have an adverse effect on our brands or our reputation. Our brand image and reputation may be negatively impacted by our ability to navigate social media campaigns and trends in pursuit of various dynamic issues facing society on regional and global levels across the markets in which we operate.  Further, our success is dependent on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, including trademarks, patents, domain names, trade secrets and know-how. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be sufficient or that third parties will not infringe upon or misappropriate these rights or that other parties may claim that our brands infringe on their intellectual property rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. 18Table of ContentsThe global beer industry and the broader alcohol industry are constantly evolving, and our position within the global beer industry and the success of our products in our markets may fundamentally change. If we do not successfully transform along with the evolving industry, market dynamics and consumer preferences, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.    The brewing industry has significantly evolved over the years becoming an increasingly consolidated global beer market. For many years, the industry operated primarily on local presence with modest international expansion achieved through export, license and partnership arrangements. In contrast, it has now become increasingly complex and competitive as the consolidation of brewers has resulted in fewer major market participants. As a result of the increased global consolidation of brewers and the dynamic of an expanding new segment within the industry with new market entrants, the markets in which we operate, particularly the more mature markets, may evolve at a disadvantage to our current market position. In addition, local governments may intervene, which may fundamentally accelerate transformational changes to such markets. For example, the beer markets in the U.S. and Canada have long consisted of a select number of significant market participants with government-regulated routes to market. However, evolution in these markets and our other beer markets, together with emerging changes to consumer preferences, have resulted in a significant increase in market entrants, consumer choices and market competition, as well as increased government scrutiny. Our Coors Light and Miller Lite brands in the Americas, and Carling, Staropramen, Ozujsko, Bergenbier and Coors brands in EMEA&APAC represented more than half of each respective segment's sales volumes in 2022. Additionally, several of our brands represent a significant share of their respective market and, therefore, continued volatility in these markets could disproportionately impact the performance of these brands. Consequently, any material shift in consumer preferences away from these brands, or from the categories in which they compete, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Furthermore, the broader alcohol industry is experiencing a shift in drinking preferences and behaviors of consumers due to, among others, changing taste preferences, changing demographics, downturns in economic conditions or perceived value, as well as changes in consumers' perception of our brands and the brands of our competitors due to negative publicity, regulatory actions or litigation. There has been more attention focused on health concerns and the harmful consumption of alcoholic beverages, which could result in a change in the social acceptability of beer and other alcoholic beverages, which could materially impact the consumption of beer, other alcoholic beverages and, consequently, our sales. If we are unsuccessful in evolving with, and navigating through, these changes to the markets in which we operate, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Specifically, the markets in which we operate have experienced vast expansion in above premium products, specifically in flavored malt beverages (including hard seltzers), ready-to-drink beverages, spirit-based beverages, craft beer, cider, CBD and other cannabis beverages and other similar beverages. If our competitors are able to respond more quickly to the evolving trends within those and similar beverage categories, or if our new products in these categories are not successful, our business and financial results may be adversely impacted. In addition, Canada has passed, and certain states in the U.S. have passed or are considering passing, laws and regulations that allow the sale and distribution of cannabis. It is not possible to predict the impact that widespread adoption of laws and regulations permitting the sale and distribution of cannabis may have on sales of our alcoholic beverages, but it is possible that legal cannabis usage could adversely impact the demand for our products. In Canada, changes to interprovincial trade rules, regulations, distribution models, and packaging requirements, such as government-owned retail outlets and industry standard returnable bottles, may be disadvantageous to us. Currently, in Ontario and other provinces, provincial governments are reviewing and, in some cases, changing this historical foundation as a result of this market evolution and increased demand by some for government's intervention to remove distribution regulations, including potential changes to the beer distribution and the retail systems in Ontario as discussed below. In addition, along with other brewers in Canada, we currently use an industry standard returnable bottle which represents approximately 25% of total volume sales (excluding imports) in Canada. Changes to the Industry Standard Bottle Agreement could impact our use of the industry standard returnable bottle. If we cease to use the industry standard returnable bottle in Canada, our current bottle inventory and a portion of our bottle packaging equipment could become obsolete and could result in a material write-off of these assets.Our products also generally compete with other alcoholic beverages. We compete with other beer and alcoholic beverage companies not only for legal age drinker acceptance and loyalty, but also for shelf, cold box and tap space in retail establishments and for marketing focus by our distributors and their customers, all of which also distribute and sell other beers and alcoholic beverage products. If we do not successfully transform along with the evolving industry and market dynamics and consumer preferences, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.Competition in our markets could require us to reduce prices or increase capital and other expenditures or cause us to lose sales volume, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    In many of our markets, our primary competitors may have greater financial, marketing, production and distribution resources than we do, and may be more diverse in terms of their geographies and brand portfolios. Furthermore, our competitors may respond to industry 19Table of Contentsand economic conditions and shifts in consumer behaviors more rapidly or effectively than us. In order for us to remain competitive, we will need to quickly and correctly adopt digital technologies, build analytical capabilities and scale brand expense investment levels, which our competitors may be able to achieve faster and with more resources. In all of the markets in which we operate, aggressive marketing strategies, such as reduced pricing, brand positioning, and increased capital or other investments by these competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, continuing consolidation among major global brewers and between brewers and other beverage companies and convergence of beverage categories may lead to stronger or new competitors, loss of partner brands, negative impacts on our distributor networks, alternate distribution networks and pressures from marketing and pricing tactics by competitors. Further consolidation of distributors in our industry could reduce our ability to promote our brands in the markets in a manner that enhances rather than diminishes our brands' value, as well as reduce our ability to manage our pricing effectively and efficiently. Additionally, due to competition with brewers and other beverage companies, an increase in the purchasing power of our large competitors may cause further pricing pressures which could prevent us from increasing prices to recover higher costs necessary to compete. Such pressures could have a material adverse impact on our business and our financial results and market share. Failure to generate cost savings and margin improvement through our ongoing initiatives could adversely affect our profitability. Increased pressures for reduced pricing or difficulties in increasing prices while remaining competitive within our markets, as well as the need for increased capital investment, marketing and other expenditures could result in lower profitability or loss of market share and volumes. We may also face inflationary pressures that may negatively influence our or our competitors' prices and reduce margins on our products. Moreover, most of our major markets are mature, so growth opportunities may be more limited to us than to our global competitors who may already be in such markets. For example, net sales in our Americas segment accounted for approximately 81% of our total 2022 net sales. As a result, to the extent that we are unable to maintain or grow our market share in our mature markets, our sales and, in turn, business and financial results could be materially and adversely affected.Our success as an enterprise depends on our ability to successfully and timely innovate beyond beer, and any inability to deliver new products could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    As part of our revitalization plan, our future topline growth will depend, in part, on our ability to timely innovate and develop new products beyond traditional beer. In connection with our revitalization plan, we plan to continue to innovate, test and scale products faster than we have before. In addition, we also rely on certain arrangements with partner brands for innovation, development and growth in new products beyond beer. However, the launch and ongoing success of new products are inherently uncertain, especially with respect to consumer appeal. The launch of a new product can give rise to a variety of incremental or on-time costs and an unsuccessful launch or short-lived popularity of our product innovations could, among other things, affect consumer perception of our existing brands and our reputation as well as result in inventory write-offs and other costs. Our inability to attract consumers to our product innovations relative to our competitors’ products, especially over time, could have a material adverse effect on our growth, business and financial results.Changes in the social acceptability, perceptions and the political view of the beverage categories in which we operate, including alcohol and cannabis, could adversely affect our business.    In recent years, there has been an increase in public and political attention on health and well-being as they relate to alcoholic beverages and the other categories in which we operate, including cannabis. In addition, the alcoholic beverage industry is regularly the subject of anti-alcohol activist activity related to health concerns from the harmful consumption of alcohol, concerns regarding underage drinking, and exposure to alcohol advertisements. Negative publicity regarding alcoholic beverages and changes in consumer perceptions in relation to beer, other alcoholic, CBD, or other cannabinoid beverages could adversely affect the sale and consumption of our products, which could adversely affect our business and financial results. The changing legal landscape with respect to cannabis and the lack of consumer market data makes it difficult to predict the pace at which the cannabis market may grow, if at all, and the products that consumers will purchase in the cannabis marketplace. Additionally, the concerns around alcohol, CBD and cannabis as well as health and well-being could result in unfavorable regulations or other legal requirements in certain markets in which we operate, such as advertising, selling and other restrictions, increased taxes associated with our sales, or the establishment of minimum unit pricing. Any such regulations or requirements could change consumer and customer purchasing patterns and may require us to incur significant compliance costs, which could negatively impact our business and financial results. In particular, advocates of prohibition and other severe restrictions on the marketing and sales of alcohol are becoming increasingly organized and coordinated on a global basis, seeking to impose laws or regulations or to bring actions against us, to substantially curtail the consumption of alcohol, including beer, in developed and developing markets. To the extent such views gain traction in regulations of jurisdictions in which we do or plan to do business, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, in February 2021, the European Union published its Europe Beating Cancer Plan. As part of the plan, by the end of 2023, the European Union has indicated it will issue a proposal for mandatory health warnings on alcohol beverage product labels. In addition, Ireland passed a law requiring new health warning labels on our products.Due to a high concentration of workers represented by unions or trade councils, we could be significantly affected by labor strikes, work stoppages or other employee-related issues.    As of December 31, 2022, approximately 31% and 24% of 20Table of Contentsour Americas and EMEA&APAC workforces, respectively, are represented by trade unions or councils. Stringent labor laws in certain of our key markets expose us to a greater risk of loss should we experience labor disruptions in those markets. A prolonged labor strike, work stoppage, unionization efforts or other employee-related issues could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, in the first few months of 2021, we experienced a labor disruption with our Toronto brewery unionized employees resulting from on-going negotiations of the collective bargaining agreement. This labor disruption resulted in slightly slower than expected production at the Toronto brewery in the first few months of 2021. From time to time, our collective bargaining agreements come due for renegotiation, and, if we are unable to timely complete negotiations, affected employees may strike, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.There were four collective bargaining agreements in Québec that expired at the end of 2021. In late 2021 and in 2022, we began negotiating one of these collective bargaining agreements with our Montreal unionized distribution and brewery employees. At the end of March through mid-June 2022, approximately 400 unionized employees in our Montreal/Longueuil, Québec brewery and distribution centers went on strike, which adversely affected our business, operations and financial results during the second and third quarters of 2022. As of the third quarter of 2022, we successfully negotiated all four collective bargaining agreements in Québec that expired at the end of 2021. Two of the four collective bargaining agreements in Québec expire on December 31, 2026 and the remaining two collective bargaining agreements expire on December 31, 2027. Despite these new agreements, there may be additional labor strikes, work stoppages, unionization efforts or other employee-related issues, either prior to or following the expiration of these agreements, each of which could significantly affect our business and financial results.ESG issues, including those related to climate change and sustainability, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation.    Companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny relating to their ESG practices and policies. Increased focus and activism related to ESG may hinder our access to capital or negatively impact our stock price, as investors may reconsider their capital investment based on their assessment of our ESG practices and policies. In particular, investor advocacy groups, institutional investors, stockholders, employees, consumers, customers, regulators, proxy advisory services and other market participants have increasingly focused on ESG practices and policies of companies, including sustainability performance and risk mitigation efforts. These stakeholders have placed increased importance on ESG practices and their effect on companies from an investor, consumer, customer or employee perspective. If our ESG practices do not meet investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards or evolving regulatory requirements, our stock price, brand, sales, ability to access capital markets, reputation and employee retention, among other things, may be negatively affected. In addition, as part of Our Imprint 2025 strategy, we published goals across a range of ESG areas, including environmental sustainability and diversity, equity and inclusion (""DEI"") matters. If we do not adapt to or comply with new ESG regulations, such as those related to climate change, carbon emissions and related ESG disclosure requirements, or fail to meet the ESG goals under Our Imprint 2025 strategy or evolving investor, industry or stakeholder expectations and standards, or if we are perceived (whether or not valid) to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, customers and consumers may choose to stop purchasing our products or purchase products from a competitor, and our reputation, business or financial results may be adversely affected. Although we intend to meet these goals, we may be required to expend significant resources to do so, which could increase our operational costs. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope or nature of these goals, or for any revisions to our goals. Moreover, we may determine that it is in the best interest of our Company and our stockholders to prioritize other business, social, governance or sustainable investments over the achievement of our current goals based on economic, technological developments, regulatory and social factors, business strategy or pressure from investors, activist groups or other stakeholders. If we are unable to meet these goals, then we could incur adverse publicity and reaction from investors, activist groups or other stakeholders, which could adversely impact the perception of us and our products and services by current and potential customers, as well as investors, which could adversely impact our business and financial results.Climate change and other weather events may negatively affect our business and financial results.    There is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures could cause significant changes in global weather patterns and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Global climate change could have various impacts on our operations, ranging from more frequent extreme weather events to extensive governmental policy developments, which have the potential individually or collectively to significantly disrupt our business as well as negatively affect our suppliers, supply chain and customers. Changing weather patterns and more volatile weather conditions could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions that may impact quality, limit availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities, such as hops, barley and other cereal grains, which are important ingredients for our products. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions, including power disruptions due to the foregoing, could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain, distribution networks and routes to market, or impact demand for our products, any of which may cause us to experience additional costs to maintain or resume operations.21Table of ContentsPublic concern over climate change has resulted in, and may continue to result in, new or increased regional, federal and global legal and regulatory requirements, including taxation, to reduce or mitigate carbon emissions and to limit or impose additional costs on carbon and water usage or other climate-related objectives. In the event that such regulation is more stringent than current regulatory obligations, or the measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor and improve our resource efficiency, we may experience disruptions in, or increases in our costs of, operation and delivery to comply with new regulatory requirements due to investments in facilities and equipment or the relocation of our facilities. If we or our suppliers are required to comply with these laws and regulations, or if we choose to take additional voluntary steps to reduce or mitigate our impact on the climate, we may experience increased costs for energy, production, transportation, and raw materials, increased capital expenditures, or increased insurance premiums and deductibles, each of which could adversely impact our operations. In particular, proposed, new or inconsistent regulation and taxation of fuel and energy could increase the cost of complying with such laws and regulations as well as the cost of operation, including fuel required to operate our facilities or transport and distribute our products, thereby increasing the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. Any assessment of the potential impact of future climate change legislation, regulations or industry standards, as well as any international treaties and accords, is uncertain given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in the countries in which we operate.Beyond the commercial pressures implicated by climate change concerns, our operations may face potential adverse physical effects. For example, we have a major brewery in the state of Colorado, which has recently experienced several significant wildfires, and we have another major brewery in Texas, which experienced a severe winter weather event in 2021. If any of our properties and production facilities experience a significant operational disruption or catastrophic loss due to natural disasters or severe weather events, it could delay or disrupt production, shipments, and revenue, and result in potentially significant expenses to repair or replace these properties, which may negatively affect our business and financial results.An inadequate supply or availability of quality water could have a material adverse effect on, among other things, our sales, production processes, other costs and, in turn, profitability.    Quality water is a key ingredient in our brewing process. Clean water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and climate change may increase water scarcity and cause a deterioration of water quality in areas where we maintain brewing operations. The competition for water among domestic, agricultural and manufacturing users is increasing in some of our brewing communities and communities in which we or our suppliers manufacture our other products. Even where water is widely available, water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain our operations. Further, unavailability of clean water at our breweries or our other facilities or the facilities of our suppliers could limit our ability to brew, which could cause a decrease in production.We have substantial brewery operations in the states of Colorado and Texas, which have been areas vulnerable to water scarcity conditions. Certain western states in the U.S. are experiencing an extended drought, which can impact the quality and quantity of agricultural ingredients such as barley and hops. The continuation or recurrence of such conditions could have an adverse effect upon our agricultural supply chain. We and our suppliers are dependent on sufficient amounts of quality water for operation of our breweries and key facilities and the key facilities of our significant suppliers. The suppliers of the agricultural raw materials we purchase are also dependent upon sufficient supplies of quality water for their fields. A substantial reduction in water in certain agricultural areas could result in material losses of crops, such as barley or hops, which could lead to a shortage of our product supply. If water available to our operations or the operations of our suppliers becomes scarce or the quality of that water deteriorates, we may incur increased production costs or face production constraints, which could adversely affect our business and financial results. We depend on key personnel, the loss of whom could harm our business, and labor shortages, employee turnover and wage increases could significantly impact our operations.    The loss of the services and expertise of any key employee could harm our business. Our future success depends on our ability to identify, attract and retain qualified personnel on a timely basis. If we were to experience turnover of senior management or if a member of our senior management were to become ill or incapacitated, our stock price, our results of operations, our commercial and supply chain operations and our vendor or customer relationships could each be adversely impacted and such events may make recruiting for future management positions more difficult. The labor market for many of our employees is very competitive, and wages and compensation costs continue to increase. Our ability to attract and retain key talent has been, and may continue to be, impacted by challenges in the labor market, particularly in the U.S., which has recently been experiencing wage inflation, labor shortages, a continued shift toward remote work and the continued effects of the coronavirus pandemic. In addition, labor costs in the U.S. are rising and our industry is experiencing a shortage of qualified workers. If we face labor shortages and/or increased labor costs as a result of increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover rates, or increases in employee benefits costs, our operating expenses could increase, which could negatively impact our growth and results of operations. Labor shortages, higher employee turnover rates and labor union organizing efforts could also lead to disruptions in our business, as discussed above. In addition, we must successfully integrate any new management personnel that we hire within our organization, or who join our organization as a result of an acquisition, in order to achieve our operating objectives, and changes in other key management 22Table of Contentspositions may temporarily affect our financial performance and results of operations as new management becomes familiar with our business.Because of our reliance on third-party service providers and internal and outsourced systems for our information technology and certain other administrative functions, we could experience a disruption to our business.    We rely extensively on information services providers worldwide for our information technology functions including network, help desk, hardware and software configuration. Additionally, we rely on internal networks and information systems and other technology, including the internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement and supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments. We use information systems for certain human resource activities and to process our employee benefits, as well as to process financial information for internal and external reporting purposes and to comply with various reporting, legal and tax requirements. As information systems are critical to many of our operating activities, our business may be impacted by system shutdowns, service disruptions, obsolescence, or security threats or breaches. Furthermore, the importance of such information technology systems and networks has increased due to many of our employees working remotely as a result of our changing workplace dynamics. Additionally, if any of our significant service providers were to fail and we were unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner, we could be unable to properly administer our outsourced functions, which could disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial results. Impacts related to the coronavirus pandemic have disrupted, and may continue to disrupt our operations, which has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    The global coronavirus pandemic created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. Our business has been and could continue to be, materially and adversely affected by the coronavirus pandemic and related weak, or weakening of, economic or other conditions, particularly in regions where we derive a significant amount of our revenue or profit or where our suppliers and business partners are located, including those in regions of our Americas segment and EMEA&APAC segment. Therefore, unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, including as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and any resulting recession or slowed economic growth, have had, and could continue to have, an outsized negative impact on us, including changes in consumer behavior as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and related governmental or societal impositions of restrictions on public gatherings. Moreover, our operations could be disrupted by labor shortages due to our employees or employees of our business partners, including our supply chain partners, being diagnosed with the coronavirus or its related variants. The extent to which the coronavirus pandemic continues to impact our results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the resurgence of the coronavirus and its related variants, the efficacy of the vaccine and related vaccination efforts and the impact on the economic activity and regulatory actions taken to mitigate the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. The potential resurgence of the coronavirus pandemic or other diseases that impact regional or global markets in which we operate may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Further, the impact of the coronavirus pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed in Part I, Item 1A, ""Risk Factors
"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Poor investment performance of pension plan holdings and other factors impacting pension plan costs and contributions could unfavorably affect our business, liquidity and our financial results.    Our costs of providing defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on the plans' assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, exchange rate fluctuations, government regulation, court rulings or other changes in legal requirements, global equity prices, and our required and/or voluntary contributions to the plans. Although we comply with the minimum funding requirements, we have certain qualified pension plans with obligations which exceed the value of the plans' assets. These funding requirements also may require contributions even when there is no reported deficit. Without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans' assets, and depending upon the other factors as listed above, we could be required to fund the plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations (or the timing of such contributions) could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, credit rating, cost of borrowing, financial position and/or results of operations. Risks Related to Our Indebtedness, Capital Structure and Financial ConditionOur significant debt level subjects us to financial and operating risks, and the agreements governing such debt subject us to financial and operating covenants and restrictions.    Our indebtedness subjects us to various financial and operating covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions on priority indebtedness, leverage thresholds, liens, certain types of secured debt and certain types of sale lease-back transactions and transfers of assets, each of which may limit our flexibility in responding to our business needs. If we are not able to maintain compliance with stated financial covenants or if we breach other covenants in any debt agreement, we could be in default under such agreement or trigger a cross-default of other debt instruments. Such a default would adversely affect our credit ratings, may allow our creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness, and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. 23Table of ContentsOur significant debt level and the terms of such debt could, among other things:     •make it more difficult to satisfy our obligations under the terms of our indebtedness;•limit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us, or at all;    •limit our flexibility to plan for and adjust to changing business and market conditions, including successfully execute our revitalization plan, and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, such as the economic climate caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict;•require us to make unfavorable changes to our financing structure;•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to make interest and principal payments on our debt, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund strategic opportunities, including acquisitions or other investments, working capital, business activities, and other general corporate requirements;•limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, strategic opportunities, including acquisitions or other investments, to fund growth or for general corporate purposes, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity, particularly if any ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward; and•adversely impact our competitive position in the industry.In addition, certain of our current and future debt and derivative financial instruments have or, in the future, could have interest rates that are tied to reference interest rates. The volatility and availability of such reference rates are out of our control. Additionally, the discontinuation, replacement or reform of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), could affect our interest rates and financing costs. LIBOR is being discontinued and is scheduled to be fully phased-out by June 2023. In October 2021, we amended the agreement governing our revolving credit facility and replaced LIBOR as the reference interest rate with the Sterling Overnight Index Average (“SONIA”), for borrowings denominated in Pound Sterling and the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”), for borrowings denominated in Euros. It is unclear, however, if alternative rates or benchmarks, such as SONIA and EURIBOR, will be widely adopted, and this uncertainty may impact the liquidity of the SONIA and EURIBOR debt markets. SONIA and EURIBOR may be more volatile than LIBOR, and there may be uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates or as to the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amounts under the terms of an agreement or instrument that utilizes such rates or benchmarks. We have strategized and may continue to strategize and amend any current or future contracts to accommodate this transition away from LIBOR. While we do not expect the transition from LIBOR and the risks related thereto to have a material adverse effect on us, it remains uncertain at this time.A deterioration in our credit rating could increase our borrowing rates or have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain future financing or refinance current debt.    Ratings agencies may downgrade our credit ratings below their current investment grade levels if we are, or are at risk of being, unable to meet our deleveraging commitments. Although we have publicly expressed our intention to maintain an investment grade debt rating, ratings are determined by third-party rating agencies and in some cases the events that may cause us to suffer a ratings downgrade are unpredictable and outside of our control, such as the economic climate caused by the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on our business. A credit ratings downgrade, particularly a downgrade below investment grade, could increase our costs of future borrowing, negatively impact our hedging instruments or sources of short-term liquidity and harm our ability to refinance our debt in the future on acceptable terms or access the capital markets. Deterioration of our credit rating may also raise governance issues within the Company and with external regulators. Default by, or failure of, one or more of our counterparty financial institutions could cause us to incur significant losses.    As part of our risk management activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, including, among others, forward contracts, commodity swap contracts and option contracts, with various financial institutions. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by, or failure of, counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets, including as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to retrieve our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty's liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. We may incur impairments of the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    In connection with various business combinations, we have historically allocated material amounts of the related purchase prices to goodwill and other intangible assets that are considered 24Table of Contentsto have indefinite useful lives. For example, as a result of our acquisition in October 2016 of the remaining portion of MillerCoors LLC (which we refer to as the ""Acquisition""), we allocated approximately $6.3 billion and $7.6 billion to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively. These assets are tested for impairment at least annually, using estimates and assumptions affected by factors such as economic and industry conditions and changes in operating performance. Additionally, in conjunction with the brand impairment tests, we also reassess each brand's indefinite-life classification. Potential resulting charges from an impairment of goodwill or brand intangible, as well as reclassification of an indefinite-lived to a definite-lived brand intangible, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, the results of our annual goodwill impairment testing completed as of October 1, 2022, indicated that the fair value of our Americas reporting unit was below its carrying value. As a result, we recorded a partial impairment charge of $845.0 million recorded within goodwill impairment, in our consolidated statements of operations during the fourth quarter of 2022. Furthermore, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $1.5 billion related to our EMEA&APAC reporting unit. As of the year ended December 31, 2022, the Americas reporting unit was partially impaired and the EMEA&APAC reporting unit was fully impaired. Our most recent impairment analysis, conducted as of October 1, 2022, the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter, indicated that the carrying value of the Americas reporting unit was determined to be in excess of its fair value such that an impairment loss of $845.0 million was recorded. Due to the current year testing that resulted in a partial impairment, it was determined that the fair value of the Americas reporting unit is considered to be at risk of future impairment in the event of significant unfavorable changes in the forecasted cash flows (including macroeconomic risks like the continued prolonged weakening of economic conditions and cost inflation along with company-specific risks like the performance of our above premium transformation efforts and overall market performance of new innovations and our expansion in products beyond-the-beer aisle, or significant unfavorable changes in income tax rates, environmental or other regulations, including interpretations thereof), terminal growth rates, market multiples or weighted-average cost of capital utilized in the discounted cash flow analyses. Although the fair values of our indefinite-lived intangible assets are in excess of their carrying values, the fair values are sensitive to the aforementioned potential changes that could have an adverse impact on future analyses. Any future impairment of the Americas reporting unit or our indefinite-lived intangible assets, or reclassification of indefinite-lived intangible assets to definite-lived, may result in material charges that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results, as evidenced by the charges incurred during the fourth quarter of 2022 and 2020, as previously noted above. The testing of our goodwill for impairment is also predicated upon our determination of the reporting units. Any change to the conclusion of our reporting units or the aggregation of components within our reporting units could result in a different outcome to our annual impairment test. See Part II—Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, ""Critical Accounting Estimates"" and Part II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 6, ""Goodwill and Intangible Assets"" for additional information related to the results of our annual impairment testing.The estimates and assumptions on which our financial projections are based may prove to be inaccurate, which may cause our actual results to materially differ from such projections, which may adversely affect our future profitability, cash flows and stock price.    Our financial projections, including any sales or earnings guidance or outlook we may provide from time to time, are dependent on certain estimates and assumptions related to, among other things, our revitalization plan, category growth, development and launch of innovative new products, market share projections, product pricing, sales, volume and product mix, foreign exchange rates and volatility, tax rates, interest rates, commodity prices, distribution through truck versus railcar, cost savings, accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves, measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing business, fund internal growth, repurchase our stock, make acquisitions, invest in joint ventures, pay dividends and meet debt obligations. In addition, our ability to achieve our revitalization plan goals, and the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of our restructuring activities, are subject to various assumptions and uncertainties. There is no assurance that we will fully realize the anticipated costs and other benefits of our restructuring activities or execute successfully on our revitalization plan in the time frames we desire or at all. Our financial projections are based on historical experience and on various other estimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made, and our actual results may differ materially from our financial projections, especially in light of the increased difficulty in making such estimates and assumptions as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Any material variation between our financial projections and our actual results may adversely affect our future profitability, cash flows and stock price.Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third PartiesWe rely on a small number of suppliers to obtain the input materials, in particular the packaging materials, we need to operate our business. The inability to obtain materials or disruptions at the facilities of our suppliers could unfavorably affect our ability to produce our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    We purchase certain types of input and other packaging materials, including aluminum cans and bottles, glass bottles, paperboard and carbon dioxide from a small number of suppliers. The demand for such input materials in the beverage industry has significantly increased, and there has been a shortage of capacity and increases in costs. In addition, consolidation of 25Table of Contentspackaging materials suppliers has reduced local supply alternatives and increased risks of supply disruptions. The inability of any of these suppliers to meet our production requirements without sufficient time to develop an alternative source could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Additionally, if the financial condition of these suppliers deteriorates, our business and financial results could be adversely impacted. Our suppliers’ financial condition is affected in large part by conditions and events that are beyond our and their control, including: •competitive and general market conditions in the locations in which they operate; •the availability of capital and other financing resources on reasonable terms; •loss of major customers; •disruptions of bottling operations that may be caused by strikes, work stoppages, labor unrest or natural disasters; •the price of certain ingredients and raw materials used in our products to increase and/or we may experience disruptions to our operations; or •any of the foregoing, among other things, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic or otherwise. A deterioration of the financial condition or results of operations of one or more of our major suppliers could adversely affect our business and financial results.Termination or changes of one or more manufacturer, distribution or production agreements, or issues caused by our dependence on the parties to these agreements, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    We manufacture and distribute products of other beverage companies through various joint venture, licensing, distribution, contract brewing or other similar arrangements, such as our agreement to produce, import, market, distribute and sell certain Heineken brands in Canada, and our arrangements with ABI to brew and distribute Beck's, Stella Artois, and Lowenbrau and to distribute Hoegaarden, Leffe, and Corona in Central Europe. We also have agreements with Asahi for the production and import of Pilsner Urquell and Peroni Nastro Azurro into the U.S. under a perpetual royalty-free license. In addition, we produce, market, sell and distribute the Topo Chico Hard Seltzer and Simply Spiked branded products pursuant to authorizations from The Coca-Cola Company. These agreements have varying expiration dates and performance criteria, with several agreements approaching expiration in the near future. The non-renewal or loss of one or more of these arrangements, because of failure to perform or failure to agree to terms of an extension, or as a result of industry consolidation or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. As part of our efforts to streamline operations and to manage capital investments, we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers’ orders on a timely basis. The ability of these third parties to perform is largely outside of our control. If one or more of these parties experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase, we may have to seek alternative providers, which could increase our costs or prevent or delay the delivery of our products. Further, our business includes various joint venture and industry agreements which standardize parts of the supply chain system. An example includes our warehousing and customer delivery systems in Canada organized under joint venture agreements with other brewers. Any negative change in these agreements or material terms within these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Risks Related to Legal Matters, Governmental Regulations and our International OperationsUnfavorable outcomes of legal or regulatory matters may adversely affect our business and financial condition and damage our reputation.    We are from time to time involved in or subject to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings or matters related to our business, our advertising and marketing practices, product claims, product labeling and ingredients, our intellectual property rights, alleged infringement or misappropriation by us of intellectual property rights of others, tax, environmental, privacy, insurance, ERISA and employment matters. Such matters, even those that are ultimately non-meritorious, can be complex, costly, and highly disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and other key personnel, and may generate adverse publicity that damages our reputation or brand image. The assessment of the outcome of such matters, including our potential liability, if any, is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events that are not within our control and are based on the information available to management at that time. The outcome of such matters, including amounts ultimately received or paid upon judgment or settlement, may differ materially from management’s outlook or estimates, including any amounts accrued in the financial statements. Actual outcomes, including judgments, awards, settlements or orders, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flows and damage our corporate reputation and our brands.    26Table of ContentsOur operations in developing and emerging markets expose us to additional risks, which could harm our business and financial results.    We continue to operate in developing and emerging markets. In certain of these markets, we have limited operating experience and may not succeed. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this report, our operations in these markets expose us to additional heightened risks, including: •changes in local political, economic, social and labor conditions; •restrictions on foreign ownership and investments; •repatriation of cash earned in countries outside the U.S.; •import and export requirements; •increased costs to ensure compliance with complex foreign laws and regulations;•currency exchange rate fluctuations; •a less developed and less certain legal and regulatory environment, which among other things can create uncertainty with regard to liability issues; •longer payment cycles, increased credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud; •increased exposure to global disease outbreaks or pandemics, such as the coronavirus pandemic; and •other challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences.In addition, as a global company, we are subject to foreign and U.S. laws and regulations designed to combat governmental corruption, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the U.K. Proceeds of Crime Act. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, each of which could have a materially negative effect on our reputation, brands and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, there can be no assurance that our employees, business partners or agents will not violate our policies and procedures.Changes to the regulation of the distribution systems for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results.    Many countries in which we operate regulate the distribution of alcohol products and if those regulations were changed, it could alter our business practices and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, in the U.S. market, there is a three-tier distribution system that governs the sale of malt beverage products. That system, requiring separation of manufacturers, distributors and retailers, dates back to the repeal of prohibition and is periodically subject to legal challenges. To the extent that such challenges are successful and change the three-tier system, including through the expansion of e-commerce and direct-to-consumer offerings, such changes could have a material adverse effect on our Americas segment results of operations. Further, in Canada, our products are required to be distributed through each province's respective provincial liquor board. Additionally, in certain Canadian provinces, we rely on our joint venture arrangements with BRI and BDL to distribute our products via retail outlets that are mandated and regulated by provincial government regulators. BRI owns and operates commercial retail outlets, known as The Beer Store, in Ontario, and BDL facilitates the distribution of our products in the western Canadian provinces. If provincial regulation should change, the costs to adjust our distribution methods could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Our consolidated financial statements are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, most significantly the Canadian dollar and the European operating currencies such as, Euro, British Pound, Czech Koruna, Croatian Kuna, Serbian Dinar, New Romanian Leu, Bulgarian Lev and Hungarian Forint.    We hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in different currencies, most significantly in Canada and throughout Europe. Because our financial statements are presented in USD, we must translate our assets, liabilities, income and expenses into USD. Increases and decreases in the value of the USD will affect, perhaps adversely, the value of these items in our financial statements, even if their local currency value has not changed. Additionally, we are exposed to currency transaction risks related to transactions denominated in currencies other than one of the functional currencies of our operating entities, such as the purchase of certain raw material inputs or capital expenditures, as well as sales transactions and debt issuances or other incurred obligations. Further, certain actions by the government of any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our results and financial position. To the extent that we fail to adequately manage these risks through our risk management policies intended to protect our exposure to currency movements, which may affect our operations, including if our hedging arrangements do not effectively or completely hedge changes in foreign currency rates, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. For instance, the strengthening of the USD against the Canadian dollar, European currencies and various other global 27Table of Contentscurrencies would adversely impact our USD reported results due to the impact on foreign currency translation.Changes in tax, environmental, trade or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing, trade and other regulations could cause volatility or have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Our business is highly regulated by national, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in various jurisdictions regarding such matters as tariffs, licensing requirements, trade and pricing practices, labeling, advertising, promotion and marketing practices, relationships with distributors, environmental matters, packaging material regulations, ingredient regulations, unclaimed property and other matters. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent re-evaluation, varying interpretations and political debate and inquiries from government regulators charged with their enforcement, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Future changes to U.S. or foreign trade policies, impositions of new or increased tariffs, other trade restrictions or other government actions, including any government shutdown, foreign currency fluctuations, including devaluations and fear of exposure to or actual impacts of a widespread disease outbreak, such as the coronavirus pandemic, may lead to the continuation or escalation of such risks and uncertainty. In addition, changes to existing tax laws or the adoption of new tax policies, regulations, guidance or laws, particularly in the U.S., U.K. and Canada, could have a material adverse impact to our effective tax rate, future cash tax liabilities and our financial results in general. The current economic and political environment, including the focus on corporate tax reform, anti-base erosion rules and tax transparency, may result in significant tax law changes in the numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. The recent enactment of certain U.S. tax legislation, including the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, could result in an increase in our effective tax rate or cash tax and adversely impact our financial results. Most recently, intergovernmental organizations such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and European Commission have proposed changes to the existing tax laws of member countries. Those proposals include a 15% global minimum tax on certain multinational companies, as well as changes in allocations of profit among tax jurisdictions in which companies operate, which if enacted by those countries in which we operate, could increase our overall tax liability and adversely impact our financial results.Continued economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, may make resolving tax disputes more difficult, and prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to enforcement activities, as well as legislative investigation and inquiry, which could also result in changes in tax policies or prior tax rulings. The final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation can differ from our historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse effect on our financial performance.Additionally, modifications of laws and policies governing foreign trade and investment, including trade agreements and tariffs such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the European Union-United Kingdom Trade and Cooperating Agreement, or aluminum tariffs, could adversely affect our supply chain, business and results of operations. For example, in June 2018, U.S. tariffs on aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and EU went into effect (though the U.S. lifted the aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico in May 2019), which created volatility in the price of aluminum in the U.S. and increased the price of aluminum used in some of our product packaging. Continued imposition of U.S. aluminum tariffs, the implementation of additional tariffs and retaliatory tariffs from trade partners or related uncertainties could further increase the cost of certain of our imported materials, thereby adversely affecting our profitability. In addition, the recently enacted European Union-United Kingdom Trade and Cooperating Agreement resulted in certain disruptions in trade and the movement of goods, including prolonged transportation delays, which affected our ability to source raw materials and packaging for our products as well as our ability to import and export products.Furthermore, various jurisdictions have adopted, or may seek to adopt, additional product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the availability of our beverages relating to perceived adverse health consequences of some of our beverages. If additional or more severe requirements of this type are imposed on one or more of our beverages under current or future laws or regulations, they could inhibit sales of such beverages in such jurisdictions. In addition, we cannot predict whether our beverages will become subject to increased rules and regulations regarding labeling or warnings which, if enacted, could increase our costs or adversely impact sales.In addition, a number of governmental authorities, both in the U.S. and abroad, have considered, and are expected to consider, legislation aimed at reducing the amount of plastic waste. Programs have included banning certain types of products, mandating certain rates of recycling and/or the use of recycled materials, imposing deposits or excise taxes on packaging material, and requiring retailers or manufacturers to take back packaging used for their products. Such legislation, as well as voluntary initiatives, aimed at reducing the level of plastic wastes, could reduce the demand for certain of our products that contain plastic packaging, result in greater costs for manufacturers of plastic products or otherwise impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, changes in applicable environmental regulations, including increased or 28Table of Contentsadditional regulations to discourage the use of plastic may result in increased compliance costs, increased costs, capital expenditures, incremental investments and other financial obligations for us and our business partners, which could affect our profitability. We may not be able to implement price increases for our products to cover any increased costs, and any price increases we do implement may result in lower sales volumes.The government(s) of each country in which we sell our products, including state and local jurisdictions in the U.S., levies excise taxes at varying rates. Additionally, U.S. governmental entities also levy taxes and may require bonds to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Increases in excise taxes, and such compliance taxes and bonds, could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.Failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or changes in these laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof, specifically tax and environmental laws or any other laws or regulations could result in the loss, revocation or suspension of our licenses, permits or approvals and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of, and potential future developments in, complex domestic and international tax laws and regulations, the amount and timing of future taxable income and the interaction of such laws and regulations among jurisdictions. Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded.Risks Related to Acquisitions and Joint VenturesRisks associated with operating our joint ventures may materially adversely affect our business and financial results.    We have entered into several joint ventures, including our joint ventures with Ball Corporation (i.e., Rocky Mountain Metal Container), and with Owens-Brockway Glass Container Inc. (i.e., Rocky Mountain Bottle Company), for a portion of our aluminum and glass packaging supply in the U.S., respectively. In addition, we have entered into a joint venture with HEXO Corp. to pursue opportunities to develop, produce and market non-alcoholic, cannabis-infused beverages in Canada and were previously party to a joint venture with HEXO Corp. regarding similar opportunities for CBD beverages in certain U.S. markets. We have also entered into a joint venture with The Yuengling Company LLC to expand the distribution of Yuengling beer in the western U.S. We also have a joint venture in the U.K. regarding the production and distribution of Cobra beer. Additionally, in certain Canadian provinces, we rely on joint venture agreements with BRI and BDL to distribute our products via retail outlets that are mandated and regulated by provincial government regulators. As previously referenced, BRI owns and operates commercial retail outlets, known as The Beer Store, in Ontario, and BDL facilitates the distribution of our products in the western Canadian provinces. We may enter into additional joint ventures in the future. Our joint venture partners may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or with the goals of the joint venture. In addition, we compete against our joint venture partners in certain of our other markets. Disagreements with our business partners may impede our ability to maximize the benefits of our partnerships. Our joint venture arrangements may require us, among other matters, to pay certain costs or to make certain capital investments or to seek our joint venture partner's consent to take certain actions. In addition, our joint venture partners may be unable or unwilling to meet their economic or other obligations under the operative documents, or may become insolvent or file for bankruptcy protection and we may be required to either fulfill those obligations alone to ensure the ongoing success of a joint venture or to dissolve and liquidate a joint venture. Failure to successfully identify, complete or integrate attractive acquisitions and joint ventures into our existing operations could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.    We have made a number of acquisitions and entered into several strategic joint ventures. In order to compete in the consolidating global brewing and beverage industry, we anticipate that we may, from time to time, in the future acquire additional businesses or enter into additional joint ventures that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our business, such as the Acquisition and our joint ventures with HEXO and Yuengling and various other craft acquisitions we have made recently. Potential risks associated with acquisitions and joint ventures could include, among other things: •our ability to identify attractive acquisitions and joint ventures; •our ability to offer potential acquisition targets and joint venture partners' competitive transaction terms; •our ability to raise capital on reasonable terms to finance attractive acquisitions and joint ventures; •our ability to realize the benefits or cost savings that we expect to realize as a result of the acquisition or joint venture; •diversion of management's attention; •our ability to successfully integrate our businesses with the business of the acquired company; •motivating, recruiting and retaining key employees; 29Table of Contents•conforming standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures among our company and the acquired company; •consolidating and streamlining sales, marketing and corporate operations; •potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies; •potential exposure to unknown or future liabilities or costs that affect the markets in which acquired companies or joint ventures operate; •reputational or other damage due to the conduct of a joint venture partner or the prior conduct of an acquired company; •loss of key employees and customers of an acquired company; and •managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations following completion of an acquisition or entry into a joint venture. Additional Risks Related to our Americas SegmentOur U.S. business is highly dependent on independent distributors to sell our products, with no assurance that these distributors will effectively sell our products, and distributor consolidation in the U.S. could harm our business and financial results.    We sell nearly all of our products, including all of our imported products, in the U.S. to independent distributors for resale to retail outlets. These independent distributors are entitled to exclusive territories and protected from termination by state statutes and regulations. Consequently, if we are not allowed, or are unable under acceptable terms or at all, to replace unproductive or inefficient distributors, our business, financial position and results of operation may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Further, in recent years, there has been a consolidation of independent distributors, resulting in distributors with increased leverage over suppliers due to the distributor's share of the supplier business, exclusive territorial appointments and regulatory protection of distribution agreements. We have limited ability to influence decisions regarding distributor consolidation, which, regardless of size, carries a risk of decreased investment in service and local marketing in the interest of paying down the leverage required to fund a transaction. Consolidation among distributors could create a more challenging competitive landscape for our products and could hinder the distribution and sale of our products. There is a risk that consolidation of distributors could further increase due to potential changes in tax laws in the markets in which we operate. This could negatively impact sales of certain growth driver products, such as hard seltzers and ready to drink beverages, and increase prices. Our unique portfolio may require more brand building than our competitors, which could be adversely affected in the event of distributor consolidation.  Changes in distributors' strategies, including a reduction in the number of brands they carry, may adversely affect our growth, business, financial results and market share.Government mandated changes to the retail distribution model resulting from new regulations may have a material adverse effect on our Canada business.    In June 2019, the Ontario government adopted a bill that, if enacted, would terminate a 10-year Master Framework Agreement that was originally signed in 2015 between the previous government administration and Molson Canada 2005, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of our Company, Labatt Brewing Company Limited, Sleeman Breweries Ltd., and Brewers Retail Inc. and dictates the terms of the beer distribution and retail systems in Ontario through 2025. The government has not yet proclaimed the bill as law, and the impacts of the potential legislative changes are unknown at this time but could have a negative impact on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of the Americas Segment. Molson Canada 2005 and the other Master Framework Agreement signatories are prepared to vigorously defend our rights and pursue legal recourse, should the Master Framework Agreement be unilaterally terminated by the enactment of the 2019 legislation. The initial term of the Master Framework Agreement does not expire until December 31, 2025, and the Master Framework Agreement contains a provision requiring two-year advance notice of the government's intention to not renew the Master Framework Agreement.Our Americas business faces numerous risks relating to its joint venture in the Canadian cannabis industry and its former involvement in the U.S. CBD beverage industry.    In 2018, a wholly-owned subsidiary within our Canadian business completed the formation of an independent Canadian joint venture with HEXO Corp., a Canadian entity listed on the NASDAQ and the Toronto Stock Exchange that serves the Canadian cannabis market. The joint venture, Truss LP (""Truss""), is producing and marketing non-alcoholic, cannabis-infused beverages for the Canadian market. The success and consumer acceptance of any products produced by the joint venture cannot be assured. As of the end of 2022, we exited the U.S. CBD market. Further, our Canadian subsidiary’s involvement in the Canadian cannabis industries and our former involvement in the U.S. CBD market may have, and may continue to, negatively impact consumer, business partner, investor or public sentiment regarding our brands, Americas' beer business or our company. The emerging cannabis and CBD industries in Canada and the U.S. and in other jurisdictions is evolving rapidly and involves a high degree of political, legal and regulatory uncertainty. The occurrence 30Table of Contentsof any of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, there is regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. regarding the status of food and beverage products that contain U.S. hemp-derived ingredients, including CBD, which, in part, contributed to our decision to exit the U.S. CBD market. While our involvement in the U.S. CBD market consisted of operations and sales of such products in states where the sale and distribution of hemp-derived CBD beverages is permitted, U.S. federal law enforcement officials may still elect to take enforcement action against companies under the Controlled Substances Act or the Food and Drug Administration may send a cease and desist letter, either of which action could have an impact on our future involvement in the U.S. CBD market.  Indemnities provided to the purchaser of our previous interest in the Cervejarias Kaiser Brasil S.A. (""Kaiser"") business in Brazil could result in future cash outflows and statement of operations charges.    In 2006, we sold our previous ownership interest in Kaiser, which was held by our Canadian business, to FEMSA Cerveza S.A. de C.V. (""FEMSA""). The terms of the sale agreement require us to indemnify FEMSA for exposures related to certain tax, civil and labor contingencies and certain purchased tax credits. The ultimate resolution of these claims is not under our control. These indemnity obligations are recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets; however, we could incur future statement of operations charges due to changes to our estimates or changes in our assessment of probability of loss on these items as well as due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Due to the uncertainty involved in the ultimate outcome and timing of these contingencies, significant adjustments to the carrying value of our indemnity liabilities and corresponding statement of operations charges/credits could result in the future. Additional Risks Related to our EMEA&APAC SegmentEconomic trends and intense competition in European markets could unfavorably affect our profitability.    Our European businesses have been, and, in the future may be, adversely affected by conditions in the global financial markets and general economic and political conditions, as well as a weakening of their respective currencies versus the U.S. dollar, in each case, in addition to the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. Additionally, we face intense competition in certain of our European markets, particularly with respect to pricing, which could lead to reduced sales or profitability. In particular, the on-going focus by large competitors in Europe to drive increased market share through aggressive pricing strategies could adversely affect our sales and results of operations. We may also face pressures resulting from a reduction in disposable incomes of consumers to spend on our products due to inflation, recessionary conditions and an increase in the cost of energy, primarily in countries located in central and eastern Europe, which could unfavorably affect our profitability. In addition, in recent years, beer volume sales in Europe have been shifting from on-premise, such as pubs and restaurants, to off-premise, such as retail stores, for the industry as a whole. Margins in sales to off-premise customers tend to be lower than margins from sales to on-premise customers, and, as a result, continuation or acceleration of this trend could further adversely affect our profitability.Risks Related to Ownership of our Class B Common StockIf Pentland and the Coors Trust do not agree on a matter submitted to our stockholders or if a super-majority of our board of directors do not agree on certain actions, generally the matter will not be approved, even if beneficial to us or favored by other stockholders or a majority of our board of directors.    Pentland Securities (1981) Inc. (""Pentland"") (a company controlled by the Molson family and related parties) and the Adolph Coors, Jr. Trust (the ""Coors Trust"") (a trust controlled by the Coors family and related parties), which together control more than 90% of our Class A common stock and Class A exchangeable shares, have a voting trust agreement through which they have combined their voting power over the shares of our Class A common stock and the Class A exchangeable shares that they own. If these two stockholders do not agree to vote in favor of a matter submitted to a stockholder vote (other than the election of directors), the voting trustees are required to vote all of the Class A common stock and Class A exchangeable shares deposited in the voting trust against the matter. There is no other mechanism in the voting trust agreement to resolve a potential deadlock between these stockholders. Therefore, if either Pentland or the Coors Trust is unwilling to vote in favor of a proposal that is subject to a stockholder vote, we would be unable to implement the proposal even if our board of directors, management or other stockholders believe the proposal is beneficial to us. Similarly, our bylaws require the authorization of a super-majority (two-thirds) of the board of directors to take certain transformational actions. Thus, it is possible that our Company will not be authorized to take action even if it is supported by a simple majority of the board of directors.The interests of the controlling stockholders may differ from those of other stockholders and could prevent our Company from making certain decisions or taking certain actions that would be in the best interest of the other stockholders.    Our Class B common stock has fewer voting rights than our Class A common stock and holders of our Class A common stock have the ability to effectively control or have a significant influence over certain of our actions requiring stockholder approval, which could have a material adverse effect on Class B stockholders. See Part II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 14, ""Stockholders' Equity"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding voting rights of Class A and Class B stockholders.    31Table of ContentsShareholder activism efforts or unsolicited offers from a third-party could cause a material disruption to our business and financial results.    We may be subject to various legal and business challenges due to actions instituted by shareholder activists or unsolicited third-party offers. Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of shareholder activism may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business or other instability and may affect our relationships with vendors, customers, prospective and current employees and others. Proposed or future laws and regulations may increase the chance we become the target of shareholder activist campaigns, including ESG-related actions. If shareholder activist campaigns are initiated against us, our response to such actions could be costly and time-consuming, which could divert the attention and resources of our Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategies, which could harm our business, negatively impact our stock price, and have an adverse effect on our business and financial results"
4,TAP,MOLSON COORS BREWING CO,2021-02-11,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORSInvesting in our Company involves risk. The reader should carefully consider the following risk factors and the other information contained within this report. The risks set forth below are those that management believes are most likely to have a material adverse effect on us. The reader is encouraged to read each risk factor as related and interconnected to the other risk factors set forth in this section. However, the risks set forth below are not a comprehensive description of the risks facing our Company. We may also be subject to other risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial but may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods. If the following risks or uncertainties, individually or in combination, actually occur, they may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations or prospects. See also ""Cautionary Statement Pursuant to Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995."" Risks Related to our Company and OperationsThe novel coronavirus pandemic, efforts to mitigate or disrupt the pandemic and related weak, or weakening of, economic or other negative conditions, have disrupted, and may continue to disrupt our business, which has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our operations, liquidity, financial condition and financial results. Our business has been, and we currently expect will continue to be, materially and adversely affected by the coronavirus pandemic and related weak, or continued weakening of, economic or other negative conditions, particularly in regions where we derive a significant amount of our revenue or profit or where our suppliers and business partners are located, including, in North America and Europe. Specifically, the coronavirus pandemic has disrupted and we currently expect it to continue to disrupt our business and potential associated financial impacts. Those impacts include, but are not limited to, lower net sales in markets affected by the pandemic, including potential material shifts in, and impacts to, demand, the inability to sell our products to on-premise consumers and further disruption to the on-premise channel, including staged on premise re-openings and subsequent closure of on-premise accounts, our ability to reinstate or pay a dividend, the delay of, and potential increased costs related to, inventory production and fulfillment, including packaging availability impacted by package mix shifts related to off-premise demand, including significantly increased need for and limited supplies of aluminum cans and paperboard, and lower return rates of our returnable packaging in certain markets, potentially impacting net sales and cost of goods globally and increased incremental costs associated with mitigating the effects of the pandemic, including increased raw materials, freight and logistics costs and other expenses. Packaging material supply shortages and supply chain constraints have impacted and could continue to negatively impact our ability to meet increased demand in off-premise channels or particular packages, particularly aluminum cans, which in turn could impact our net sales revenues and market share. Continued disruption and 18Table of Contentsdeclines in the global economy have impacted and could continue to impact our customers’ liquidity and capital resources and therefore our ability to collect, or the timeliness of collection of our accounts receivable from them, which may have a material adverse impact on our performance, cash flows and capital resources. The coronavirus pandemic is ongoing, and its dynamic nature, including uncertainties relating to the ultimate spread of the virus, newer variants, the severity of the disease, the duration of the pandemic, the roll out and efficacy of the vaccines and related prolonged weakening of economic or other negative conditions, such as a recession or slowed economic growth in our markets, and actions that may be taken by governmental authorities to contain the pandemic or to mitigate its impact, makes it difficult to forecast any effects on our results of operations for 2021 and in subsequent years. However, our results of operations in 2020 were negatively affected and we currently expect our results of operations for 2021 to be significantly and adversely affected.Specifically, difficult macroeconomic conditions in our markets, such as further decreases in per capita income and level of disposable income, increased and prolonged unemployment or a further decline in consumer confidence as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, as well as limited or significantly reduced points of access of our product, could continue to have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products. Under difficult economic conditions, consumers may continue to seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products, by shifting away from our above-premium products to lower-priced products offered by us or other companies or by shifting to off-premise from on-premise consumption, negatively impacting our net sales and margins. Softer consumer demand for our products could reduce our profitability and could negatively affect our overall financial performance. A significant portion of our consolidated net sales revenues are concentrated in markets where the coronavirus pandemic impacts have been significant. Therefore, unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, including as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and any resulting recession or slowed economic growth, have had, and could continue to have, an outsized negative impact on us. In addition, difficult economic conditions may have a negative impact on our ability to access capital markets and other funding sources, on acceptable terms or at all, should we seek future financing. Additionally, we may have unexpected costs and liabilities; revenue and cash provided by operations may continue to decline; macroeconomic conditions may continue to weaken; prolonged and severe levels of unemployment may negatively impact our consumers; and competitive pressures may increase, resulting in difficulty maintaining adequate liquidity and meeting our deleverage commitments and as a result, our credit ratings could be downgraded, which would adversely impact our business, including by increasing our costs of future borrowing and harming our ability to refinance our debt in the future on acceptable terms or access the capital markets, if we are able to obtain additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us at all. Further, notwithstanding the amendment to our revolving credit facility on June 19, 2020 to revise the leverage ratios under the financial maintenance covenant upwards for the six fiscal quarters beginning with the second quarter of 2020, should the impacts of the pandemic and resulting performance adversely affect our ability to remain compliant with our covenants in our revolving credit facility agreement and absent another amendment or waiver from participating lenders, the outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility agreement may become immediately due. Such events may additionally trigger an event of default on our senior notes resulting in the potential acceleration of amounts due thereunder. In addition, the coronavirus pandemic and related efforts to mitigate its spread, have impacted, and may continue to impact for the foreseeable future, customer traffic to the on-premise channel, which includes bars, restaurants and sporting, festival and other large venues. Many governmental authorities across our North America and Europe businesses have required that bars and restaurants limit, close or cease sit-down service, which has negatively impacted and we expect will continue to negatively impact on-premise sales of our beverages and previously led to the incurrence of costs to repurchase products that on-premise accounts or distributors were unable or prohibited from selling as a result of the governmental regulations. Despite the limited reopening of on-premise accounts in certain of our markets in the second and third quarters, sales to restaurants and bars have not returned to pre-pandemic levels and in many instances, the reopened on-premise accounts have been subsequently forced to close in certain of our markets as a result of an increase in the spread of the coronavirus. We currently expect that closures and reduced on-premise consumption may continue for an unknown period, negatively impacting our net sales and margins. We also expect some on-premise accounts will see a decrease in demand as colder weather in the North American and European markets may reduce or eliminate their outdoor seating capacity. In addition, sporting events, festivals and other large public gatherings where our products are served have been canceled or permitted to take place only with limited or no attendance by the public throughout North America and Europe and we expect them to largely remain cancelled until a vaccine is distributed to the majority of the public. Additionally, these and other governmental or societal impositions of restrictions on public gatherings, especially if prolonged in nature, will have adverse effects on on-premise traffic and, in turn, our business. Even if such measures are not implemented and coronavirus does not spread more significantly, or if after the pandemic has subsided, fear of re-occurrence or the perceived risk of infection or health risk may adversely affect traffic to the on-premise channel and, in turn, may have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, particularly if any self-imposed or governmental changes are in place for a significant amount of time.Moreover, our operations could be disrupted by our employees or employees of our business partners, including our supply chain partners, being diagnosed with coronavirus or were suspected of having coronavirus or other illnesses since this could require us or our business partners to quarantine some or all such employees or close and disinfect our or their facilities. If a significant percentage of our workforce or the workforce of our business partners are unable to work or if we or our 19Table of Contentsbusiness partners are required to close our or their production facilities, including because of illness or travel or government restrictions in connection with the coronavirus pandemic, our operations, including manufacturing and distribution capabilities, may be negatively impacted, potentially materially adversely affecting our business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. The global beer industry and the broader alcohol industry are constantly evolving, and our position within the global beer industry and our markets in which we operate may fundamentally change. If we do not successfully transform along with evolving industry and market dynamics, then the result could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    The brewing industry has significantly evolved over the years becoming an increasingly global beer market. For many years, the industry operated primarily on local presence with modest international expansion achieved through export, license and partnership arrangements. In contrast, it has now become increasingly complex as the global consolidation of brewers has resulted in fewer major market participants. At the same time, smaller local brewers within certain geographies are seeing accelerated growth as consumers increasingly place value on locally-produced and/or regionally-sourced products. As a result of the increased global consolidation of brewers and the dynamic of an expanding new segment within the industry with new market entrants, the markets in which we operate, particularly the more mature markets, may evolve at a disadvantage to our current market position and local governments may intervene, which may fundamentally accelerate transformational changes to such markets. For example, the North American beer markets have long consisted of a select number of significant market participants with government-regulated routes to market. However, evolution in these markets and our other beer markets, together with emerging changes to consumer preferences, have introduced a significant increase in market entrants and resulted in increased consumer choice and market competition, as well as increased government scrutiny. Specifically, our North American and European markets have experienced vast expansion in the craft beer industry along with the expansion of cider, flavored malt beverages (including hard seltzers), CBD beverages and other similar beverages. If our competitors are able to respond more quickly to the evolving trends within the craft beer, cider, hard seltzer, flavored malt beverages, CBD beverages and other similar beverages categories, or if our new products in these categories are not successful, our business and financial results may be adversely impacted. In addition, certain states in the U.S. have passed or are considering passing, and Canada has passed, laws and regulations that allow the sale and distribution of cannabis. Currently, it is not possible to predict the impact of this on sales of alcoholic beverages but it is possible that legal cannabis usage could adversely impact the demand for our products. Furthermore, imported beers also continue to compete aggressively in the U.S. In Canada, changes to interprovincial trade rules, regulations, distribution models, and packaging requirements, such as government-owned retail outlets and industry standard returnable bottles, may be disadvantageous to us. Currently, in Ontario and other provinces, provincial governments are reviewing and/or changing this historical foundation as a result of this market evolution and increased demand by some for government's intervention to remove distribution restrictions. We also compete generally with other alcoholic beverages. We compete with other beer and beverage companies not only for legal age drinker acceptance and loyalty, but also for shelf, cold box and tap space in retail establishments and for marketing focus by our distributors and their customers, all of which also distribute and sell other beers and alcoholic beverage products.In addition, the broader alcohol industry is experiencing a rapid shift in drinking preferences and behaviors. We believe this has been driven by a generational demographic shift away from beer in particular towards other alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. As discussed above, even within the beer industry we have seen a shift away from the traditionally most popular beer brands and segments and a corresponding expansion in the craft beer industry along with the expansion of cider, hard seltzers, flavored malt beverages, CBD beverages and other similar beverages. Accordingly, we have initiated our revitalization plan, pursuant to which we will strive to achieve more consistent topline growth by expanding beyond beer and into adjacent beverage categories. However, if we are unsuccessful in evolving with, and navigating through, the changes to the markets in which we operate, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Competition in our markets could require us to reduce prices or increase capital and other expenditures or cause us to lose sales volume, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    In many of our markets, our primary competitors have greater financial, marketing, production and distribution resources than we do, and may be more diverse in terms of their geographies and brand portfolios. In all of the markets in which we operate, aggressive marketing strategies, such as reduced pricing, brand positioning, and increased capital or other investments by these competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, continuing consolidation among major global brewers and between brewers and other beverage companies may lead to stronger or new competitors, loss of partner brands, negative impacts on our distributor networks and pressures from marketing and pricing tactics by competitors. Further, consolidation of distributors in our industry could reduce our ability to promote our brands in the markets in a manner that enhances rather than diminishes our brands' value, as well as reduce our ability to manage our pricing effectively and efficiently. Additionally, due to competition with brewers and other beverage companies, an increase in the purchasing power of our large competitors may cause further pricing pressures which could prevent us from increasing prices to recover higher costs necessary to compete. Such pressures could have a material adverse impact on our business and our financial results and market share. Failure to generate significant cost savings and margin improvement through our ongoing 20Table of Contentsinitiatives could adversely affect our profitability. Increased pressures for reduced pricing or difficulties in increasing prices while remaining competitive within our markets, as well as the need for increased capital investment, marketing and other expenditures could result in lower margins or loss of market share and volumes. Moreover, most of our major markets are mature, so growth opportunities may be more limited to us than to our global competitors. For example, net sales in North America accounted for approximately 85% of our total 2020 net sales. As a result, to the extent that we are unable to maintain or grow our market share in our mature markets, our sales and, in turn, business and financial results could be materially and adversely affected.Our success as an enterprise currently depends largely on the success of relatively few products in several mature markets specific to the beer industry; if consumer preferences shift away from our products, consumption of our products decline or we are unable to successfully and timely innovate beyond beer, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.    Our Coors Light and Miller Lite brands in the U.S., Coors Light, Molson Canadian, Coors Original and Carling brands in Canada, and Carling, Staropramen, Jelen, Bergenbier and Coors Light brands in Europe represented more than half of each respective segment's sales volumes in 2020. Additionally, several of our brands represent a significant share of their respective market, therefore volatility in these markets could disproportionately impact the performance of these brands. Consequently, any material shift in consumer preferences away from these brands, or from the categories in which they compete, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Consumer preferences and tastes may shift away from our brands or beer generally due to, among others, changing taste preferences, demographics, downturn in economic conditions or perceived value, as well as changes in consumers' perception of our brands due to negative publicity, regulatory actions or litigation. Recently, there has been more attention focused on health concerns and the harmful consumption of alcoholic beverages which could result in a change in the social acceptability of beer and other alcoholic beverages which could materially impact the consumption of beer and our sales. Additionally, in some of our major markets, specifically North America and Europe, there has been a shift in consumer preferences within the total beer market away from premium brands to ""craft beer"" produced by smaller, regional microbreweries, as well as a shift within the total alcohol beverage market from beer to wine and spirits. More recently, the rapid growth of hard seltzers in the U.S. may have shifted some consumers away from our brands and beer generally. Moreover, several of our major markets are mature and we have a significant share in such markets, therefore, small movements in consumer preference, such as consumer shifts away from premium light brands, can also disproportionately impact our results. Although the ultimate impact is currently unknown, the emergence of legal cannabis in certain states in the United States and in Canada may result in a shift of discretionary income away from our products or a change in consumer preferences away from beer. As a result, a shift in consumer preferences away from our products or beer or a decline in the consumption of our products could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Furthermore, as part of our revitalization plan, our future topline growth will depend, in part, on our ability to timely innovate and develop new products beyond traditional beer. In connection with our revitalization plan, we plan to innovate, test and scale products faster than we have before. However, the launch and ongoing success of new products are inherently uncertain, especially with respect to consumer appeal. The launch of a new product can give rise to a variety of costs and an unsuccessful launch or short-lived popularity of our product innovations could, among other things, affect consumer perception of our existing brands and our reputation as well as result in inventory write-offs and other costs. In addition, the coronavirus pandemic has altered, and in some cases, delayed product innovation efforts. We were making progress against these ambitions, before the impact of the coronavirus pandemic became widespread throughout North America and Europe. As a result of this pandemic and resulting uncertainty in the economy, we are making adjustments in the short-term and intend to use the savings, generated from the revitalization plan, to help protect our cash and liquidity position. Our inability to attract consumers to our product innovations relative to our competitors’ products, especially over time, could negatively affect our growth, business, and financial results.The success of our business relies heavily on brand image, reputation, product quality and protection of intellectual property.    It is important that we maintain and increase the image and reputation of our existing brands and products. Concerns about product quality, even when unsubstantiated, could be harmful to our image and the reputation of our brands and products. While we have quality control programs in place, in the event we or our third-party manufacturers experience an issue with product quality or if any of our products become unsafe or unfit for consumption, are misbranded or cause injury, we may experience recalls or liability in addition to business disruption which could further negatively impact brand image and reputation, negatively affect our sales and cause us to incur additional costs. A widespread product recall, multiple product recalls or a significant product liability judgment could cause our products to be unavailable for a period, which could further reduce consumer demand and brand equity. Our brand image and reputation may also be more difficult to protect due to less oversight and control as a result of the outsourcing of some of our operations. We also could be exposed to lawsuits relating to product liability, marketing or sales practices or intellectual property infringement. Deterioration to our brand equity may be difficult to combat or reverse and could have a material effect on our business and financial results. In addition, because our brands carry family names or we may partner with celebrities or other famous sponsors, personal activities by certain members of the Molson or Coors families or our promotional partners that harm their public image or reputation could also have an 21Table of Contentsadverse effect on our brands or the Company. Further, our success is dependent on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, including trademarks, patents, domain names, trade secrets and know-how. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be sufficient or that third parties will not infringe upon or misappropriate these rights or that other parties may claim that our brands infringe on their intellectual property rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Changes in the social acceptability, perceptions and the political view of the beverage categories in which we operate, including alcohol and cannabis, could adversely affect our business. In recent years, there has been an increase in public and political attention on health and well-being as it relates to the alcohol beverage and other categories in which we operate. In addition, the alcoholic beverage industry is regularly the subject of anti-alcohol activist activity related to the health concerns from the misuse of alcohol and concerns regarding underage drinking and exposure to alcohol advertisements. Negative publicity regarding beer and changes in consumer perceptions in relation to beer, other alcoholic, CBD, or other cannabinoid beverages could adversely affect the sale and consumption of our products which could, in turn, adversely affect our business and financial conditions. Additionally, the concerns around alcohol, CBD and cannabis as well as health and well-being could result in unfavorable regulations or other legal requirements in certain of our markets, such as advertising, selling and other restrictions, increased taxes associated with our sales, or the establishment of minimum unit pricing. Any such regulations or requirements could change consumer and customer purchasing patterns, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. In particular, advocates of prohibition and other severe restrictions on the marketing and sales of alcohol are becoming increasingly organized and coordinated on a global basis, seeking to impose laws or regulations or to bring actions against us, to curtail substantially the consumption of alcohol, including beer, in developed and developing markets. To the extent such views gain traction in regulations of jurisdictions in which we do or plan to do business, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Weak, or weakening of, economic or other negative conditions in the markets in which we do business, including reductions in discretionary consumer spending, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Beer consumption in many of our markets is closely tied to general economic conditions and a significant portion of our portfolio consists of premium and above premium brands. Difficult macroeconomic conditions in our markets, such as further decreases in per capita income and level of disposable income driven by increases to inflation, income taxes, the cost of living, increased and prolonged unemployment or a further decline in consumer confidence as a result of the coronavirus pandemic or otherwise, as well as limited or significantly reduced points of access of our product, political or economic instability other country-specific factors could continue to have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products. For example, a trend towards value brands in certain of our markets or deterioration of the current economic conditions could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. A significant portion of our consolidated net sales revenues are concentrated in North America and Europe. Therefore, unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, such as a recession or slowed economic growth, in North America or Europe could negatively affect consumer demand for our product in these important markets. Under difficult economic conditions, consumers may continue to seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products, by shifting away from our above-premium products to lower-priced products offered by us or other companies or by shifting to off-premise from on-premise consumption, negatively impacting our net sales and margins. Softer consumer demand for our products could reduce our profitability and could negatively affect our overall financial performance.In addition, global markets continue to face threats and uncertainty. Future changes to U.S. or foreign tax and trade, policies, impositions of new or increased tariffs, other trade restrictions or other government actions, including any government shutdown, foreign currency fluctuations, including devaluations and fear of exposure to or actual impacts of a widespread disease outbreak, such as the coronavirus pandemic, may lead to continuation of such risks and uncertainty. Uncertain economic and financial market conditions may also adversely affect the financial condition of our customers, suppliers and other business partners. Any significant decrease in in consumers' purchases of our products or our inability to collect accounts receivable, resulting from an adverse impact of the global markets on consumers' financial condition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Our restructuring activities related to our revitalization plan may not be successful and the estimated costs associated with such activities may be more than expected, and our restructuring activities may adversely impact employee hiring and retention.    On October 28, 2019, as part of the revitalization plan, we made the determination to establish Chicago, Illinois as our North American operational headquarters, close our office in Denver, Colorado and consolidate certain administrative functions into our other existing office locations. However, the coronavirus pandemic has altered, and in some cases, delayed our ability to implement components of the revitalization plan. We were making progress against these ambitions before the impact of the coronavirus pandemic became widespread. As a result of this pandemic and resulting uncertainty in the economy, we made adjustments in the short-term and used a significant portion of the savings generated from the revitalization to help protect our cash and liquidity position. In connection with these consolidation activities, we currently expect to incur certain cash and non-cash restructuring charges related to severance, retention and transition costs, non-cash asset related costs, lease exit costs in connection with our office lease in Denver, Colorado, and other transition activities currently estimated in the range 22Table of Contentsof approximately $100 million to $120 million in the aggregate, the majority of which will be cash charges that we began recognizing in the fourth quarter of 2019, and will be further recognized through the balance of fiscal year 2021. During 2020 and 2019, we recognized severance and retention charges of $35.6 million and $41.2 million, respectively, bringing the aggregate of such charges to approximately $100 million since the plan was initiated. These expenses will adversely impact our results of operations during the relevant periods and will reduce our cash position. Additionally, the amount of these estimated expenses, as well as our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings, revitalization plan goals and other benefits of our restructuring activities, are subject to various assumptions and uncertainties. We may also experience additional costs in connection with these restructuring activities due to delays or other unforeseen circumstances. There is no assurance that we will successfully implement, or fully realize the anticipated costs and other benefits of our restructuring activities or execute successfully on our restructuring plan, in the time frames we desire or at all. If we fail to realize the anticipated benefits, including ongoing cost savings, or if we incur charges or costs in amounts that are greater than anticipated, our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.In connection with the consolidation of our office locations, we experienced a certain amount of employee turnover and have had to recruit, hire and train new talent. The turnover, the onboarding of new talent and any resulting distraction has the potential to negatively impact the overall performance of our employees and employee morale, resulting in loss of institutional knowledge, inefficiencies, higher short- or long-term costs, or decreased productivity. As a result of these or other similar risks, our business, plans, strategies, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected. Climate change and other weather events may negatively affect our business and financial results. There is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures could cause significant changes in global weather patterns and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Changing weather patterns and more volatile weather conditions could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions that may impact quality, limit availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities, such as hops, barley and other cereal grains, which are important ingredients for our products. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain, distribution networks and routes to market, or impact demand for our products.Public concern over climate change may result in new or increased regional, federal and global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate carbon emissions, or to limit or impose additional costs on carbon and water usage. In the event that such regulation is more stringent than current regulatory obligations, or the measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor and improve our resource efficiency, we may experience disruptions in, or increases in our costs of, operation and delivery due to investments in facilities and equipment or relocate our facilities. In particular, new regulation and taxation of fuel and energy could increase the cost of operation, including fuel required to operate our facilities or transport and distribute our products, thereby increasing the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products.There is also increased focus, including by governmental and non-governmental organizations, investors, customers and consumers on environmental sustainability matters, such as packaging waste, climate impact and water use. Our reputation could be damaged if we or others in our industry do not act, or are perceived not to act, responsibly with respect to our impact on the environment. Any failure to achieve our enterprise-wide sustainability goals, or perception (whether or not valid) of our failure to act responsibly, or to effectively respond to new, or changes in, environmental, legal or regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business, reputation or financial condition.An inadequate supply or availability of quality water could have a material adverse effect on, among other things, our sales, production processes, other costs and, in turn, profitability. Quality water is a key ingredient in our brewing process. Clean water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and climate change may increase water scarcity and cause a deterioration of water quality in areas where we maintain brewing operations. The competition for water among domestic, agricultural and manufacturing users is increasing in some of our brewing communities and communities in which we or our suppliers manufacture our other products. Even where water is widely available, water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain our operations. Further, unavailability of clean water at our breweries or our other facilities or the facilities of our suppliers could limit our ability to brew, which could cause a decrease in production.We and our suppliers are dependent on sufficient amounts of quality water for operation of our breweries and key facilities and the key facilities of our significant suppliers. The suppliers of the agricultural raw materials we purchase are also dependent upon sufficient supplies of quality water for their fields. A substantial reduction in water in certain agricultural areas could result in material losses of crops, such as barley or hops, which could lead to a shortage of our product supply. If water available to our operations or the operations of our suppliers becomes scarce or the quality of that water deteriorates, we may incur increased production costs or face production constraints. 23Table of ContentsLoss, operational disruptions or closure of a major brewery or other key facility, including those of our suppliers, due to unforeseen or catastrophic events or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Our business could be interrupted and our financial results could be materially adversely impacted by physical risks such as earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, floods, acts of war, terror attacks, cyber-attacks and other disruptions in information technology systems, disease outbreaks or pandemics, such as the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, and other natural disasters or catastrophic events that damage, disrupt or destroy one of our breweries or key facilities or the key facilities of our significant suppliers. Climate change and warmer global temperatures may also increase the intensity and frequency of these extreme weather events. If any of our breweries or key facilities or the key facilities of our significant suppliers were to experience a significant operational disruption or catastrophic loss, it could delay or disrupt production, shipments and revenue, and result in potentially significant expenses to repair or replace these properties. Such significant disruptions could be due to, among other things, the loss or disruption of the timely availability of adequate supplies of essential raw materials, including as a result of illness to our respective employees or their families or governmental restrictions on such employees' ability to travel or perform necessary business functions or as a result of the need for us or our suppliers to operate our respective businesses with substantial modifications to employee travel and employee work locations; transportation and logistics challenges, including as a result of port and border closures and other governmental restrictions and the availability and capacity of shipping channels as customers may shift to increased online shopping; and the loss or disruption of other manufacturing, distribution and supply capabilities. Additionally, certain catastrophes are not covered by our general insurance policies, which could result in significant unrecoverable losses. Furthermore, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted by under-investment in physical assets or production capacity, including contract brewing and effect on priority of our brands if production capacity is limited. Further, significant excess capacity at any of our breweries as a result of increased efficiencies in our supply chain process or continued volume declines, could result in under-utilization of our assets, which could lead to excess overhead expenses or additional costs incurred associated with the closure of one or more of our facilities. For example, as part of a strategic review of our supply chain network, certain breweries and bottling lines were closed in recent years, and we have and continue to incur brewery closure costs, including charges associated with the planned closure of the Irwindale brewery in 2020, which was subsequently sold to Pabst Brewing Company, LLC, in the fourth quarter of 2020. We regularly review our supply chain network to ensure that our supply chain capacity is aligned with the needs of the business. Such reviews could potentially result in further closures and the related costs could be material.In addition, we have experienced minor temporary workforce disruptions in our supply chain as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. We have implemented employee safety measures, based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization, across all our supply chain facilities, including proper hygiene, social distancing, mask use and temperature screenings. These measures may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of the coronavirus among our employees, illness, travel restrictions, absenteeism or other workforce disruptions could negatively affect our supply chain, manufacturing, distribution or other business processes. We may face additional production disruptions in the future which may place constraints on our ability to produce products in a timely manner or may increase our costs.Due to a high concentration of workers represented by unions or trade councils in North America and Europe, we could be significantly affected by labor strikes, work stoppages or other employee-related issues.  As of December 31, 2020, approximately 33% and 29% of our North American and European workforces, respectively, are represented by trade unions or councils. Stringent labor laws in certain of our key markets expose us to a greater risk of loss should we experience labor disruptions in those markets. A prolonged labor strike, work stoppage or other employee-related issue, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, in the first quarter of 2017, our Toronto brewery unionized employees commenced a labor strike initiated from on-going negotiations of the collective bargaining agreement. This labor strike resulted in slower than expected production at the Toronto brewery in the first quarter of 2017. From time to time, our collective bargaining agreements come due for renegotiation, and, if we are unable to timely complete negotiations, affected employees may strike, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.Because of our reliance on third-party service providers and internal and outsourced systems for our information technology and certain other administrative functions, we could experience a disruption to our business.    We rely extensively on information services providers worldwide for our information technology functions including network, help desk, hardware and software configuration. Additionally, we rely on internal networks and information systems and other technology, including the internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement and supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments. We use information systems for certain human resource activities and to process our employee benefits, as well as to process financial information for internal and external reporting purposes and to comply with various reporting, legal and tax requirements. As information systems are critical to many of our operating activities, our business may be impacted by system shutdowns, service disruptions, obsolescence, or security breaches. Furthermore, the importance of such information technology systems and networks and systems has increased due to many of our employees working remotely as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Additionally, if one of our service providers were to fail and we were unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner, we could be unable to properly administer our outsourced functions. 24Table of ContentsA breach of our information systems could cause material financial or reputational harm.    Our information systems may be the target of cyber-attacks or other security breaches, which, if successful, could, among other things, expose us to the loss of key business, employee, customer or vendor information, cause us to breach our legal, regulatory or contractual obligations, create an inability to access or rely upon critical business records or cause a disruption of our operations. These breaches may result from human errors, equipment failure, or fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties. If our information systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results and we may lose revenue and profits as a result of our inability to timely manufacture, distribute, invoice and collect payments from our customers. We have seen an increase in the number of such attacks recently as a large number of our employees are working remotely and accessing our technology infrastructure remotely as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.  Further, such attacks may originate from nation states or attempts by outside parties, hackers, criminal organizations or other threat actors.We expend significant financial resources to protect against threats and cyber-attacks and may be required to further expend financial resources to alleviate problems caused by physical, electronic and cyber security breaches. As techniques used to breach security are growing in frequency and sophistication and are generally not recognized until launched against a target, regardless of our expenditures and protection efforts, we may not be able to implement security measures in a timely manner or, if and when implemented, these measures could be circumvented. Misuse, leakage or falsification of information could result in a violation of data privacy laws and regulations, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, damage our reputation and credibility or expose us to increased risk of lawsuits, loss of existing or potential future customers and/or increases in our security costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information and may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight or consumers may avoid our brands due to negative publicity. We could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In the event of a breach resulting in loss of data, such as personally identifiable information or other such data protected by data privacy or other laws, we may be liable for damages, fines and penalties for such losses under applicable regulatory frameworks despite not handling the data. Further, the regulatory framework around data custody, data privacy and breaches varies by jurisdiction and is an evolving area of law. We may not be able to limit our liability or damages in the event of such a loss.Poor investment performance of pension plan holdings and other factors impacting pension plan costs could unfavorably affect our business, liquidity and our financial results.    Our costs of providing defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on the plans' assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, exchange rate fluctuations, government regulation, court rulings or other changes in legal requirements, global equity prices, and our required and/or voluntary contributions to the plans. While we comply with the minimum funding requirements, we have certain qualified pension plans with obligations which exceed the value of the plans' assets. These funding requirements also may require contributions even when there is no reported deficit. Without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans' assets, and depending upon the other factors as listed above, we could be required to fund the plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations (or the timing of such contributions) could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, credit rating, cost of borrowing, financial position and/or results of operations. We depend on key personnel, the loss of whom could harm our business.    The loss of the services and expertise of any key employee could harm our business. Our future success depends on our ability to identify, attract and retain qualified personnel on a timely basis. If we were to experience turnover of senior management or if a member of our senior management were to become ill or incapacitated, our stock price, our results of operations and our client relationships could each be adversely impacted and such events may make recruiting for future management positions more difficult. In addition, we must successfully integrate any new management personnel that we hire within our organization, or who join our organization as a result of an acquisition, in order to achieve our operating objectives, and changes in other key management positions may temporarily affect our financial performance and results of operations as new management becomes familiar with our business. Risks Related to Our Indebtedness, Capital Structure and Financial ConditionOur significant debt level subjects us to financial and operating risks, and the agreements governing such debt subject us to financial and operating covenants and restrictions.    Our indebtedness subjects us to various financial and operating covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions on priority indebtedness, leverage thresholds, liens, certain types of secured debt and certain types of sale lease-back transactions and transfers of assets, each of which may limit our flexibility in responding to our business needs. If we are not able to maintain compliance with stated financial covenants or if we breach other covenants in any debt agreement, we could be in default under such agreement or trigger a cross-default of other debt instruments. Such a default would adversely affect our credit ratings, may allow our creditors to accelerate the related 25Table of Contentsindebtedness, and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. Our significant debt level and the terms of such debt could, among other things:     •make it more difficult to satisfy our obligations under the terms of our indebtedness;    •limit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us, or at all;    •limit our flexibility to plan for and adjust to changing business and market conditions, including successfully          execute our revitalization plan, and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry         conditions, such as the current economic climate caused by the coronavirus pandemic;•require us to make unfavorable changes to our current financing structure;•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to make interest and principal payments on our debt, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future acquisitions, working capital, business activities, and other general corporate requirements;•limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, strategicopportunities, including acquisitions or other investments, to fund growth or for general corporate purposes,even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity, particularly if any ratings assigned to our debt securitiesby rating organizations were revised downward; and•adversely impact our competitive position in the industry.In addition, certain of our current and future debt and derivative financial instruments have or, in the future, could have interest rates that are tied to reference interest rates, such as the LIBOR. The volatility and availability of such reference rates are out of our control. Accordingly, changes to or the unavailability of such rates, could result in increases to the cost of debt which would negatively affect our profitability. For example, in 2017, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority announced that after 2021 it would no longer persuade or compel panel banks to submit the rates required to calculate LIBOR, and it is unclear whether the banks currently reporting information used to set LIBOR will stop doing so after 2021. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect any discontinuance, modification or other reforms to LIBOR or any other reference rate, or the establishment of alternative reference rates will have on us. However, should LIBOR no longer be available or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from their current form, our borrowing costs could increase, which would negatively affect our profitability, and the attractiveness of borrowings under our current credit facility or future debt issuances could diminish, thereby limiting our access to capital.A deterioration in our credit rating could increase our borrowing rates or have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain future financing or refinance current debt.    Ratings agencies may downgrade our credit ratings below their current investment grade levels if we are unable to meet our deleveraging commitments. While we have publicly expressed our intention to maintain an investment grade debt rating, ratings are determined by third-party rating agencies and in some cases the events that may cause us to suffer a ratings downgrade are unpredictable and outside of our control, such as the economic climate caused by the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on our business. A credit ratings downgrade, particularly a downgrade below investment grade, could increase our costs of future borrowing, negatively impact our hedging instruments and harm our ability to refinance our debt in the future on acceptable terms or access the capital markets. Default by, or failure of, one or more of our counterparty financial institutions could cause us to incur significant losses.    As part of our risk management activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, including, among others, forward contracts, commodity swap contracts, option contracts, with various financial institutions. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by, or failure of, counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets, including as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to retrieve our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty's liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. Our operations face significant exposure to changes in commodity prices, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.    We use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials, some of which are purchased through supply contracts with third parties, to produce our products, including barley, malted barley, hops, corn, other various starches, water and packaging materials, including aluminum cans and bottles, glass and polyethylene 26Table of Contentsterephthalate containers, as well as, cardboard and other paper products. We also use a significant amount of diesel fuel, natural gas and electricity in our operations. The supply and price of these raw materials and commodities can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including market demand, alternative sources for suppliers, global geopolitical events (especially as to their impact on crude oil prices and the resulting impact on diesel fuel prices), global disease outbreaks or pandemics, such as the coronavirus pandemic, trade agreements among producing and consuming nations, governmental regulations, including tariffs, frosts, droughts and other weather conditions, changes in precipitation patterns, the frequency of extreme weather events, economic factors affecting growth decisions, inflation, plant diseases, theft and industry surcharges and other practices. For example, in June 2018, U.S. tariffs on aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and EU went into effect (though the U.S. lifted the aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico in May 2019), which has created volatility in the price of aluminum in the U.S. and increased the price of aluminum used in some of our product packaging. In addition, our North America business unit is exposed to variability in the market price of a regional premium differential (referred to as “Midwest Premium” in the U.S.) charged by industry participants to deliver aluminum from the smelter to the manufacturing facility. This premium differential also fluctuates in relation to several conditions, including based on the supply of and demand for aluminum in a particular region, associated transportation costs and warehouse financing transactions, which limit the amount of physical aluminum available to consumers and increases the price differential as a result. During times of greater volatility in the Midwest Premium, the variability in our cost of goods sold can also increase. In addition to impacting the price we pay for the raw materials we purchase, changing premium differentials impact our end consumers as we must either pass on the increased cost to those consumers or experience a decrease in our profit margins as a result of the Midwest Premium differential. Increases in the Midwest Premium, or the inability to pass through any fluctuation in aluminum prices or regional premiums to our end consumers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.Further, despite our ability to source raw materials necessary to meet demand for our products, certain raw materials such as barely, malted barley, hops, corn, other various starches, water and packaging materials, including aluminum cans and, bottles, glass and polyethylene terephthalate containers, as well as cardboard and other paper products, have been adversely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. In recent years, we experienced a shift in the allocation among different packaging types toward aluminum cans and bottles and away from glass bottles. This accelerated in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic where we observed a shift in volume to off-premise channels and aluminum cans and away from on-premise channels and glass bottles. In general, aluminum cans allow for lower packaging costs compared to most other types of packaging materials. The trend away from glass bottles could result in higher fixed cost deleverage related to these assets and an ultimate decreased need for the assets that support this packaging, which could adversely impact profitability. In Canada, the standard returnable bottle requires significant investment behind our returnable bottle inventory and bottling equipment. Although we are unable to predict the impact to our ability to source these materials in the future, we expect these supply pressures to continue into 2021. We distribute our products and receive raw materials primarily by rail or truck. Reduced availability of rail or trucking capacity has caused, and could continue to cause, us to incur unanticipated expenses. In particular, reduced trucking capacity due to shortages of drivers, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, and a federal regulation requiring drivers to electronically log their driving hours, among other reasons, have caused an increase in the cost of transportation for us and our suppliers. We believe commodity and other cost increases and volatility especially due to the coronavirus pandemic, could continue in the future. If such increases occur or exceed our estimates or projections and we are not able to increase the prices of our products or achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed. In addition, even if we increase the prices of our products in response to increases in the cost of commodities or other cost increases, we may not be able to sustain our price increases. Sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume as competitors may not adjust their prices or consumers may decide not to pay the higher prices, which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share, and our projections may not accurately predict the volume impact of price increases, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, to the extent any of the foregoing factors affect the availability or prices of ingredients or packaging or our hedging arrangements do not effectively or completely hedge changes in commodity price risks and we are not able to pass these increased costs along to customers, our business and financial results could also be materially adversely impacted.We may incur impairments of the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    In connection with various business combinations, we have historically allocated material amounts of the related purchase prices to goodwill and other intangible assets that are considered to have indefinite useful lives. For example, as a result of the acquisition of the remaining portion of MillerCoors LLC (""MillerCoors"") which occurred on October 11, 2016 (the ""Acquisition""), we allocated approximately $6.3 billion and $7.6 billion to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively. These assets are tested for impairment at least annually, using estimates and assumptions affected by factors such as economic and industry conditions and changes in operating performance. Additionally, in conjunction with the brand impairment tests, we also reassess each brand's indefinite-life classification. Potential resulting charges from an impairment of goodwill or brand intangible, as well as reclassification of an indefinite-lived to a definite-lived brand intangible, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, the results of our annual goodwill impairment testing completed as of October 1, 2020, indicated that the fair value of 27Table of Contentsour Europe reporting unit was below its carrying value. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $1.5 billion recorded within special items in our consolidated statements of operations during the fourth quarter of 2020. Additionally, we identified a triggering event requiring an interim impairment assessment of the goodwill within our historical Canada reporting unit at the end of the third quarter of 2019, which resulted in a goodwill impairment loss of $668.3 million recorded within special items in our consolidated statements of operations during the third quarter of 2019. Furthermore, in the fourth quarter of 2016, an impairment loss of $495.2 million was recorded on the Molson core brand indefinite-lived intangible assets and it was determined that the Molson core brands had characteristics that had evolved which indicated a definite-life was more appropriate. These brands were therefore reclassified as definite-lived intangible assets and are being amortized over useful lives ranging from 30 to 50 years.Our most recent impairment analysis, conducted as of October 1, 2020, the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter, indicated that the fair value of the North America reporting unit was estimated at approximately 7% in excess of its carrying value. As noted above, the carrying value of our Europe reporting unit was determined to be in excess of its fair value such that an impairment loss of approximately $1.5 billion was recorded. In the current year testing, it was determined that the fair value of the North America reporting unit declined during the year and is considered to be at risk of future impairment in the event of significant unfavorable changes in the forecasted cash flows (including Company-specific risks like the performance of our above-premium transformation efforts and overall market performance of new innovations like hard seltzers, along with macro-economic risks like the continued prolonged weakening of economic conditions, or significant unfavorable changes in tax rates, environmental or other regulations, including interpretations thereof), terminal growth rates, market multiples and/or weighted-average cost of capital utilized in the discounted cash flow analyses. The Staropramen indefinite-lived intangible asset is also considered to be at risk of future impairment with a fair value estimated at approximately 9% in excess of its carrying value as of the impairment testing date. Although the fair values of our North America reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible assets are either equal to or in excess of their carrying values, the fair values are sensitive to the aforementioned potential unfavorable changes that could have an adverse impact on future analyses. Any future impairment of the North America reporting unit or our indefinite-lived intangible assets, or reclassification of indefinite-lived intangible assets to definite-lived, may result in material charges that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results, as evidenced by the charges incurred during the third quarter of 2019 and fourth quarter of 2020, as previously noted above. The testing of our goodwill for impairment is also predicated upon our determination of our reporting units. Any change to the conclusion of our reporting units or the aggregation of components within our reporting units could result in a different outcome to our annual impairment test. See Part II—Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Critical Accounting Estimates and Part II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 10, ""Goodwill and Intangible Assets"" for additional information related to the results of our annual impairment testing.Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third PartiesTermination of one or more manufacturer/distribution/production agreements, or issues caused by our dependence on the parties to these agreements, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    We manufacture and/or distribute products of other beverage companies through various joint venture, licensing, distribution, contract brewing or other similar arrangements, such as our agreement to import, market, distribute and sell certain Heineken brands in Canada, our arrangements with ABI to brew and distribute Beck's, Stella Artois, Lowenbrau and Spaten and to distribute Hoegaarden, Leffe, and Corona in Central Europe. We also have agreements with Asahi for the production and import of Pilsner Urquell and Peroni Nastro Azurro into the U.S. under perpetual royalty-free license. These agreements have varying expiration dates and performance criteria, with several agreements approaching expiration in the near future. Non-renewal of these agreements or loss of one more or more of these arrangements, because of failure of performance, failure to come to terms on a negotiated extension, as a result of industry consolidation or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. As part of our efforts to streamline operations and to manage costs, we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers' orders on a timely basis. Additionally, in 2020, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, a producer in Canada claimed force majeure under our agreement with them, which limited our ability to get certain of our products into the market. The ability of these parties to perform is largely outside of our control. If one or more of these parties experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase, we may have to seek alternative providers, our costs could increase, and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed. Changes in various supply chain standards or agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Our business includes various joint venture and industry agreements which standardize parts of the supply chain system. An example includes our warehousing and customer delivery systems in Canada organized under joint venture 28Table of Contentsagreements with other brewers. Any negative change in these agreements or material terms within these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    We rely on a small number of suppliers to obtain the packaging materials we need to operate our business. The inability to obtain materials or disruptions at the facilities of our suppliers could unfavorably affect our ability to produce our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    We purchase certain types of packaging materials, including aluminum cans and bottles, glass bottles and paperboard from a small number of suppliers. Consolidation of packaging materials suppliers has reduced local supply alternatives and increased risks of supply disruptions. The inability of any of these suppliers to meet our production requirements without sufficient time to develop an alternative source could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Additionally, if the financial condition of these suppliers deteriorates our business and financial results could be adversely impacted. Our suppliers’ financial condition is affected in large part by conditions and events that are beyond our and their control, including: competitive and general market conditions in the locations in which they operate; the availability of capital and other financing resources on reasonable terms; loss of major customers; disruptions of bottling operations that may be caused by strikes, work stoppages, labor unrest or natural disasters; or any of the foregoing, among other things, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic or otherwise. A deterioration of the financial condition or results of operations of one or more of our major suppliers could adversely affect our business and financial results.In addition, we are actively monitoring the coronavirus pandemic and its potential impact on our supply chain and our consolidated results of operations. Due to restrictions resulting from the pandemic, global supply may be constrained, which may cause the price of certain ingredients and raw materials used in our products to increase and/or we may experience disruptions to our operations. Risks Related to Legal Matters, Governmental Regulations and our International OperationsUnfavorable outcomes of legal or regulatory matters may adversely affect our business and financial condition and damage our reputation.    We are from time to time involved in or subject to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings or matters related to our business, our advertising and marketing practices, product claims, product labeling and ingredients, our intellectual property rights, alleged infringement or misappropriation by us of intellectual property rights of others, tax, environmental, privacy, insurance, ERISA and employment matters. For instance, we have received notice of potential claims involving some current and former employees regarding our employment practices, which we are in the process of investigating. Such matters, even those that are ultimately non-meritorious, can be complex, costly, and highly disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and other key personnel, and may generate adverse publicity that damages our reputation or brand image. The assessment of the outcome of such matters, including our potential liability, if any, is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events that are not within our control and are based on the information available to management at that time. The outcome of such matters, including amounts ultimately received or paid upon judgment or settlement, may differ materially from management’s outlook or estimates, including any amounts accrued in the financial statements. Actual outcomes, including judgments, awards, settlements or orders, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flows and damage our corporate reputation and our brands.    Our operations in developing and emerging markets expose us to additional risks which could harm our business and financial results.    We expect our operations in developing and emerging markets to become more significant to our operating results as we continue to further expand internationally. In certain of these markets, we have limited operating experience and may not succeed. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report, our operations in these markets expose us to additional risks, including: changes in local political, economic, social and labor conditions; restrictions on foreign ownership and investments; repatriation of cash earned in countries outside the U.S.; import and export requirements; increased costs to ensure compliance with complex foreign laws and regulations; currency exchange rate fluctuations; a less developed and less certain legal and regulatory environment, which among other things can create uncertainty with regard to liability issues; longer payment cycles, increased credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud; increased exposure to global disease outbreaks or pandemics, such as the coronavirus pandemic; and other challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences.In addition, as a global company, we are subject to foreign and U.S. laws and regulations designed to combat governmental corruption, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, each of which could have a materially negative effect on our reputation, brands and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, there can be no assurance that our employees, business partners or agents will not violate our policies.29Table of ContentsChanges to the regulation of the distribution systems for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results.    Many countries in which we operate regulate the distribution of alcohol products and if those regulations were changed, it could alter our business practices and have material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, in the U.S. market, there is a three-tier distribution system that governs the sale of malt beverage products. That system, consisting of required separation of manufacturers, distributors and retailers, dates back to the repeal of prohibition and is periodically subject to legal challenges. To the extent that such challenges are successful and allow changes to the three-tier system, such changes could have a material adverse effect on our North America segment results of operations. Further, in Canada, our products are required to be distributed through each province's respective provincial liquor board. Additionally, in certain Canadian provinces, we rely on our joint venture arrangements, BRI and BDL, to distribute our products via retail outlets that are mandated and regulated by provincial government regulators. BRI owns and operates commercial retail outlets, known as The Beer Store, in Ontario, and BDL facilitates the distribution of our products in the western Canadian provinces. If provincial regulation should change, the costs to adjust our distribution methods could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Our consolidated financial statements are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, most significantly the Canadian dollar and the European operating currencies such as, Euro, British Pound, Czech Koruna, Croatian Kuna, Serbian Dinar, New Romanian Leu, Bulgarian Lev and Hungarian Forint.    We hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in different currencies, most significantly in Canada and throughout Europe. Because our financial statements are presented in USD, we must translate our assets, liabilities, income and expenses into USD. Increases and decreases in the value of the USD will affect, perhaps adversely, the value of these items in our financial statements, even if their local currency value has not changed. Additionally, we are exposed to currency transaction risks related to transactions denominated in currencies other than one of the functional currencies of our operating entities, such as the purchase of certain raw material inputs or capital expenditures, as well as sales transactions and debt issuances or other incurred obligations. Further, certain actions by the government of any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our results and  financial position. To the extent that we fail to adequately manage these risks through our risk management policies intended to protect our exposure to currency movements, which may affect our operations, including if our hedging arrangements do not effectively or completely hedge changes in foreign currency rates, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. For example, as a result of the U.K. vote in 2016 to leave the European Union, the GBP experienced a significant decline in comparison to USD and EUR and may continue to be volatile. Any significant further weakening of the GBP to the USD, will have an adverse impact on our European revenues as reported in USD due to the importance and relative magnitude of U.K. sales. Additionally, the strengthening of the USD against the Canadian dollar, European currencies and various other global currencies would adversely impact our USD reported results due to the impact on foreign currency translation.Changes in tax, environmental, trade or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing, trade and other regulations could cause volatility or have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Our business is highly regulated by national, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in various jurisdictions regarding such matters as tariffs, licensing requirements, trade and pricing practices, labeling, advertising, promotion and marketing practices, relationships with distributors, environmental matters, packaging material regulations, ingredient regulations, and other matters. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent re-evaluation, varying interpretations and political debate and inquiries from government regulators charged with their enforcement, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, U.S. legislative initiatives, including as proposed by the current presidential administration, to reform U.S. corporate tax law could have a material adverse impact on our tax rate and our cash tax expectations. For example, on December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Act was enacted in the U.S., which resulted in a number of significant changes to U.S. federal income tax law for U.S. corporations. Most notably, the statutory federal corporate income tax rate was changed from 35% to 21% for corporations and, as a result, we recorded an estimated net tax benefit of approximately $567 million in our consolidated statements of operations during the fourth quarter of 2017 driven by the effects of the 2017 Tax Act on our deferred tax positions as of December 31, 2017. Since 2018, the U.S. Treasury Department has continued to issue proposed, temporary and final regulations to implement provisions of the 2017 Tax Act. We have continued to monitor these regulations and on April 7, 2020, the Treasury Department  enacted final hybrid regulations with full retroactive application to January 1, 2018, with a few exceptions. We have reviewed the final regulations and their impact on our tax positions and financial statements. The final regulations, associated with the taxability of certain interest, impact tax positions we took in 2018 and 2019 and have resulted in additional income tax expense of approximately $135 million which was recognized upon enactment in the second quarter of 2020. We currently believe the impact of the finalized regulations could be cash tax outflows up to approximately $100 million in 2021. We continue to analyze the potential cash impacts of the final regulations to minimize cash outflows over time.30Table of ContentsSeparately, in December 2018, the U.S. Treasury Department issued a regulation that impacts our ability to claim a refund of certain federal duties, taxes, and fees paid for beer sold between the U.S. and certain other countries effective as of February 2019. In The National Association of Manufacturers v. United States, Slip Op. 20-09 (CIT January 24, 2020), the U.S. Court of International Trade issued an opinion ruling the portion of the regulation dealing with refunds of certain federal duties, taxes and fees paid with respect to imported beer, to the extent of exported beer, to be unlawful. In April 2020, the Government appealed the decision of the U.S. Court of International Trade with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, seeking to restore the stricken down regulation. The plaintiffs and Government have filed appellate briefs with the court as of December 2020; it is not known how much time will elapse thereafter prior to the issuance of an opinion by the Court of Appeals. If the U.S. government ultimately prevails, the Company may be required to return (by refund, credit or drawback) approximately $49 million in funds previously collected, which would have an adverse impact on our financial results.Additionally, modifications of U.S. laws and policies governing foreign trade and investment, including trade agreements and tariffs such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or aluminum tariffs, could adversely affect our supply chain, business and results of operations. For example, in June 2018, U.S. tariffs on aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and EU went into effect (though the U.S. lifted the aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico in May 2019), which has created volatility in the price of aluminum in the U.S. and increased the price of aluminum used in some of our product packaging. Continued imposition of U.S. aluminum tariffs, the implementation of additional tariffs and retaliatory tariffs from trade partners or related uncertainties could further increase the cost of certain of our imported materials, thereby adversely affecting our profitability. Furthermore, various jurisdictions have adopted, or may seek to adopt, additional product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the availability of our beverages relating to perceived adverse health consequences of some of our beverages. If additional or more severe requirements of this type are imposed on one or more of our beverages under current or future laws or regulations, they could inhibit sales of such beverages in such jurisdictions. In addition, we cannot predict whether our beverages will become subject to increased rules and regulations regarding labeling or warnings which, if enacted, could increase our costs or adversely impact sales.In addition, a number of governmental authorities, both in the U.S. and abroad, have considered, and are expected to consider, legislation aimed at reducing the amount of plastic waste. Programs have included banning certain types of products, mandating certain rates of recycling and/or the use of recycled materials, imposing deposits or taxes on packaging material, and requiring retailers or manufacturers to take back packaging used for their products. Such legislation, as well as voluntary initiatives, aimed at reducing the level of plastic wastes, could reduce the demand for certain of our products that contain plastic packaging, result in greater costs for manufacturers of plastic products or otherwise impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, changes in applicable environmental regulations, including increased or additional regulations to discourage the use of plastic may result in increased compliance costs, increased costs, capital expenditures, incremental investments and other financial obligations for us and our business partners, which could affect our profitability. In addition, we may not be able to implement price increases for our products to cover any increased costs, and any price increases we do implement may result in lower sales volumes.Finally, U.S. governmental entities also levy taxes and may require bonds to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In 2020, our U.S. business excise taxes on malt beverages were approximately $15 per hectoliter sold on a reported basis. This includes the impact of the U.S. Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act which took effect on January 1, 2018 for all qualified large domestic brewers and importers and was made permanent by the U.S. Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 on December 27, 2020. This law resulted in reduced excise taxes for MCBC in the U.S. by $2 per barrel on the first six million barrels, which equates to $1,70 per hectoliter on this portion of volume. We transfer a portion of our share of these savings to distributors consistent with the revenue splitting approach of our U.S. business' economic model. State excise taxes are levied in specific states at varying rates. Increased excise taxes could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.Failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or changes in these laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof, specifically tax and environmental laws or any other laws or regulations could result in the loss, revocation or suspension of our licenses, permits or approvals and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of, and potential future developments in, complex domestic and international tax laws and regulations, the amount and timing of future taxable income and the interaction of such laws and regulations among jurisdictions. Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded. Risks Related to Acquisitions and Joint VenturesRisks associated with operating our joint ventures may materially adversely affect our business and financial results.    We have entered into several joint ventures, including our joint ventures with Ball Corporation (i.e. Rocky Mountain Metal Container), and with Owens-Brockway Glass Container Inc. (i.e. Rocky Mountain Bottle Company), for a portion of our 31Table of Contentsaluminum and glass packaging supply in the U.S. We have also entered into a joint venture with D.G. Yuengling & Son, Inc. (""Yuengling"") to expand the distribution of Yuengling beer in the U.S. We may enter into additional joint ventures in the future. Our joint venture partners may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or with the goals of the joint venture. In addition, we compete against our joint venture partners in certain of our other markets. Disagreements with our business partners may impede our ability to maximize the benefits of our partnerships. Our joint venture arrangements may require us, among other matters, to pay certain costs or to make certain capital investments or to seek our joint venture partner's consent to take certain actions. In addition, our joint venture partners may be unable or unwilling to meet their economic or other obligations under the operative documents, and we may be required to either fulfill those obligations alone to ensure the ongoing success of a joint venture or to dissolve and liquidate a joint venture. Failure to successfully identify, complete or integrate attractive acquisitions and joint ventures into our existing operations could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.    We have made a number of acquisitions and entered into several strategic joint ventures. In order to compete in the consolidating global brewing industry, we anticipate that we may, from time to time, in the future acquire additional businesses or enter into additional joint ventures that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our business such as the Acquisition and our joint ventures with HEXO and Yuengling and various other craft acquisitions we have made recently. Potential risks associated with acquisitions and joint ventures could include, among other things: our ability to identify attractive acquisitions and joint ventures; our ability to offer potential acquisition targets and joint venture partners' competitive transaction terms; our ability to raise capital on reasonable terms to finance attractive acquisitions and joint ventures; our ability to realize the benefits or cost savings that we expect to realize as a result of the acquisition or joint venture; diversion of management's attention; our ability to successfully integrate our businesses with the business of the acquired company; motivating, recruiting and retaining key employees; conforming standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures among our company and the acquired company; consolidating and streamlining sales, marketing and corporate operations; potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies; potential exposure to unknown or future liabilities or costs that affect the markets in which acquired companies or joint ventures operate; reputational or other damage due to the conduct of a joint venture partner; loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business; and managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations following completion of an acquisition or entry into a joint venture. Additional Risks Related to our North America SegmentOur U.S. business is highly dependent on independent distributors to sell our products, with no assurance that these distributors will effectively sell our products.    We sell nearly all of our products, including all of our imported products, in the U.S. to independent distributors for resale to retail outlets. These independent distributors are entitled to exclusive territories and protected from termination by state statutes and regulations. Consequently, if we are not allowed, or are unable under acceptable terms or at all, to replace unproductive or inefficient distributors, our business, financial position and results of operation may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Government mandated changes to the retail distribution model resulting from new regulations may have a material adverse effect on our Canada business.    In June 2019, the Ontario government adopted a bill that, if enacted, would terminate a 10-year Master Framework Agreement that was originally signed between the previous government administration and MCBC, Labatt Brewing Company Limited, Sleeman Breweries Ltd., and Brewers Retail Inc. in 2015 and governs the terms of the beer distribution and retail systems in Ontario through 2025. The government has not yet proclaimed the bill as law. The impacts of these potential legislative changes are unknown at this time but could have a negative impact on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of the North America segment. While discussions remain ongoing with the government to reach a mutually agreeable alternative to the enactment of the law, we and the other Master Framework Agreement signatories are prepared to vigorously defend our rights and pursue legal recourse, should the Master Framework Agreement be unilaterally terminated by the enactment of the legislation.Our Canadian business faces numerous risks relating to its joint venture in the Canadian cannabis industry.    In 2018, a wholly-owned subsidiary within our Canadian business completed the formation of an independent Canadian joint venture with HEXO, a Canadian entity listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange that serves the Canadian cannabis market. The joint venture, Truss LP (""Truss""), is developing non-alcoholic, cannabis-infused beverages for the Canadian market. In 2020, Truss launched its first cannabis infused product, Veryvell Drops, as well as its ready to drink beverage portfolio across the Canadian market. Separately, in April 2020, we completed the formation of a new joint venture with HEXO to explore opportunities for non-alcohol hemp-derived CBD beverages in Colorado. The success and consumer acceptance of any products produced by the joint venture cannot be assured. Further, our Canadian subsidiary’s involvement in the Canadian cannabis industries and our involvement in the U.S. CBD market may negatively impact: consumer, business partner, investor or public sentiment regarding our brands, North America beer business or our company. The emerging cannabis industry in North America and in other jurisdictions is evolving rapidly and subjects us to a high degree of political, legal and regulatory uncertainty. The occurrence of any of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our business. 32Table of ContentsWe may experience adverse effects on our Canada business and financial results due to declines in the overall Canadian beer industry, continued price discounting, increased cost of goods sold and higher taxes.    If the Canadian beer market continues to decline, the impact to our financial results could be exacerbated due to our significant share of the overall market. Additionally, continuation or acceleration of price discounting, in Ontario, Québec, Alberta or other provinces, as well as increases in our cost of goods sold, could adversely impact our business. Further, changes in the Canadian tax legislation, such as the potential for an increase in beer excise taxes, could decrease our net sales. Although the ultimate impact is currently unknown, the legalization of cannabis in Canada may result in a shift of discretionary income away from our products or a change in consumer preferences away from beer or our other products. Moreover, the future success and earnings growth of the Canada business depends, in part, on our ability to efficiently conduct our operations. Failure to generate significant cost savings and margin improvement through our ongoing initiatives could adversely affect our profitability.If we are required to move away from the industry standard returnable bottle we use today in Canada, we may incur unexpected losses.    Along with other brewers in Canada, we currently use an industry standard returnable bottle which represents approximately 15% of total volume sales (excluding imports) in Canada. Changes to the Industry Standard Bottle Agreement could impact our use of the industry standard returnable bottle. If we cease to use the industry standard returnable bottle, our current bottle inventory and a portion of our bottle packaging equipment could become obsolete and could result in a material write-off of these assets.Indemnities provided to the purchaser of our previous interest in the Cervejarias Kaiser Brasil S.A. (""Kaiser"") business in Brazil could result in future cash outflows and statement of operations charges.    In 2006, we sold our previous ownership interest in Kaiser, which was held by our Canadian business, to FEMSA Cerveza S.A. de C.V. (""FEMSA""). The terms of the sale agreement require us to indemnify FEMSA for exposures related to certain tax, civil and labor contingencies and certain purchased tax credits. The ultimate resolution of these claims is not under our control. These indemnity obligations are recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, however, we could incur future statement of operations charges as facts further develop resulting in changes to our estimates or changes in our assessment of probability of loss on these items as well as due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Due to the uncertainty involved in the ultimate outcome and timing of these contingencies, significant adjustments to the carrying value of our indemnity liabilities and corresponding statement of operations charges/credits could result in the future. Additional Risks Related to our Europe SegmentThe U.K's. departure from the European Union could adversely affect us.  Approximately 7% of our consolidated net sales in 2020 came from the U.K., which is our largest market in Europe. The U.K. exited the European Union on January 31, 2020 and entered a twelve month transition period. On December 24, 2020, the deal laying out the future relationship between the U.K. and the EU was agreed, and subsequently endorsed on December 30, 2020. The U.K. vote to leave the European Union triggered a decline in the GBP in comparison to USD and EUR. Any significant continued weakening of the GBP to the USD will have an adverse impact on our European revenues as reported in USD due to the importance of U.K. sales. Furthermore, the withdrawal may result in disruption to, and decline of, the U.K. and European economies. Weakening of economic conditions or economic uncertainties tend to harm the beer business, and if such conditions continue to persist in the U.K. or in the rest of Europe, it may have a material adverse effect on our Europe segment. The withdrawal may also result in disruption in trade and the movement of goods, including prolonged transportation delays, which could negatively affect our ability to source raw materials and packaging for our products as well as our ability to import and export products. We face regulatory and market uncertainty and may need to quickly adapt to regulatory changes and market volatility, including potential increased legal and regulatory complexities and potential higher costs of conducting business in the U.K. or the rest of Europe. Any of these effects, among others, could adversely affect our European business, results of operations, and financial condition. Economic trends and intense competition in European markets could unfavorably affect our profitability.    Our European businesses have been, and, in the future may be, adversely affected by conditions in the global financial markets and general economic and political conditions, as well as a weakening of their respective currencies versus the U.S. dollar, in each case, in addition to the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. Additionally, we face intense competition in certain of our European markets, particularly with respect to pricing, which could lead to reduced sales or profitability. In particular, the on-going focus by large competitors in Europe to drive increased market share through aggressive pricing strategies could adversely affect our sales and results of operations. In addition, in recent years, beer volume sales in Europe have been shifting from pubs and restaurants (on-premise) to retail stores (off-premise) for the industry in general. Sales to off-premise customers tend to be lower than margins on sales to on-premise customers, and, as a result, continuation or acceleration of this trend would further adversely affect our profitability.33Table of ContentsRisks Related to Ownership of our Class B Common StockIf Pentland and the Coors Trust do not agree on a matter submitted to our stockholders or if a super-majority of our board of directors do not agree on certain actions, generally the matter will not be approved, even if beneficial to us or favored by other stockholders or a majority of our board of directors.    Pentland Securities (1981) Inc. (""Pentland"") (a company controlled by the Molson family and related parties) and the Adolph Coors, Jr. Trust (the ""Coors Trust"") (a trust controlled by the Coors family and related parties), which together control more than 90% of our Class A common stock and Class A exchangeable shares, have a voting trust agreement through which they have combined their voting power over the shares of our Class A common stock and the Class A exchangeable shares that they own. If these two stockholders do not agree to vote in favor of a matter submitted to a stockholder vote (other than the election of directors), the voting trustees are required to vote all of the Class A common stock and Class A exchangeable shares deposited in the voting trust against the matter. There is no other mechanism in the voting trust agreement to resolve a potential deadlock between these stockholders. Therefore, if either Pentland or the Coors Trust is unwilling to vote in favor of a proposal that is subject to a stockholder vote, we would be unable to implement the proposal even if our board of directors, management or other stockholders believe the proposal is beneficial to us. Similarly, our bylaws require the authorization of a super-majority (two-thirds) of the board of directors to take certain transformational actions. Thus, it is possible that the Company will not be authorized to take action even if it is supported by a simple majority of the board of directors.The interests of the controlling stockholders may differ from those of other stockholders and could prevent the Company from making certain decisions or taking certain actions that would be in the best interest of the other stockholders.    Our Class B common stock has fewer voting rights than our Class A common stock and holders of our Class A common stock have the ability to effectively control or have a significant influence over certain company actions requiring stockholder approval, which could have a material adverse effect on Class B stockholders. See Part II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 8, ""Stockholders' Equity"" for additional information regarding voting rights of Class A and Class B stockholders.    The estimates and assumptions on which our financial projections are based may prove to be inaccurate, which may cause our actual results to materially differ from such projections, which may adversely affect our future profitability, cash flows and stock price. Our financial projections, including any sales or earnings guidance or outlook we may provide from time to time, are dependent on certain estimates and assumptions related to, among other things, category growth, development and launch of innovative new products, market share projections, product pricing and sale, volume and product mix, foreign exchange rates and volatility, tax rates, commodity prices, distribution, cost savings, accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves, measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing business, fund internal growth, repurchase our stock, make acquisitions, invest in joint ventures, pay dividends and meet debt obligations. Our financial projections are based on historical experience and on various other estimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made, and our actual results may differ materially from our financial projections, especially in light of the increased difficulty in making such estimates and assumptions as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Any material variation between our financial projections and our actual results may adversely affect our future profitability, cash flows and stock price"
12,TAP,MOLSON COORS BREWING CO,2020-02-12,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORSInvesting in our Company involves risk. The reader should carefully consider the following risk factors and the other information contained within this report. The risks set forth below are those that management believes are most likely to have a material adverse effect on us. However, the risks set forth below are not a comprehensive description of the risks facing our Company. We may also be subject to other risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial but may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods. If the following risks or uncertainties, individually or in combination, actually occur, they may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations or prospects. See also ""Cautionary Statement Pursuant to Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.""Risks Specific to Our CompanyThe global beer industry and the broader alcohol industry are constantly evolving, and our position within the global beer industry and our markets in which we operate may fundamentally change. If we do not successfully transform along with evolving industry and market dynamics, then the result could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    The brewing industry has significantly evolved over the years becoming an increasingly global beer market. For many years, the industry operated primarily on local presence with modest international expansion achieved through export, license and partnership arrangements. In contrast, it has now become increasingly complex as the global consolidation of brewers has resulted in fewer major market participants. At the same time, smaller local brewers within certain geographies are seeing accelerated growth as consumers increasingly place value on locally-produced and/or regionally-sourced products. As a result of the increased global consolidation of brewers and the dynamic of an expanding new segment within the industry with new market entrants, the markets in which we operate, particularly the more mature markets, may evolve at a disadvantage to our current market position and local governments may intervene, which may fundamentally accelerate transformational changes to such markets. For example, the North American beer markets have long consisted of a select number of significant market participants with government-regulated routes to market. However, evolution in these markets and our other beer markets, together with emerging changes to consumer preferences, have introduced a significant increase in market entrants and resulted in increased consumer choice and market competition, as well as increased government scrutiny. Specifically, our U.S., Canada and Europe markets have experienced vast expansion in the craft beer industry along with the expansion of cider, flavored malt beverages (including hard seltzers), and other wellness beverages. If our competitors are able to respond more quickly to the evolving trends within the craft beer, cider, hard seltzer, flavored malt beverages and other wellness beverages categories, or if our new products are not successful, our business and financial results may be adversely impacted. In addition, certain states in the U.S. have passed or are considering passing, and Canada has passed, laws and regulations that allow the sale and distribution of cannabis. Currently, it is not possible to predict the impact of this on sales of alcoholic beverages but it is possible that legal cannabis usage could adversely impact the demand for our products. Furthermore, imported beers also continue to compete aggressively in the U.S. In Canada, changes to interprovincial trade rules, regulations, distribution models, and packaging requirements, such as government-owned retail outlets and industry standard returnable bottles, may be disadvantageous to us. Currently, in Ontario and other provinces, provincial governments are reviewing and/or changing this historical foundation as a result of this market evolution and increased demand by some for government intervention to increase competition and choice. We also compete generally with other alcoholic beverages. We compete with other beer and beverage companies not only for drinker acceptance and loyalty, but also for shelf, cold box and tap space in retail establishments and for marketing focus by our distributors and their customers, all of which also distribute and sell other beers and alcoholic beverage products.20Table of ContentsIn addition, the broader alcohol industry is experiencing a rapid shift in drinking preferences and behaviors. We believe this has been driven by a generational demographic shift away from beer in particular towards other alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. As discussed above, even within the beer industry we have seen a shift away from the traditionally most popular beer brands and segments and a corresponding expansion in the craft beer industry along with the expansion of cider, hard seltzers, flavored malt beverages and other wellness beverages. Accordingly, we have initiated our revitalization plan, pursuant to which we will strive to achieve more consistent topline growth by expanding beyond beer and into adjacent beverage categories. However, if we are unsuccessful in evolving with, and navigating through, the changes to the markets in which we operate, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Competition in our markets could require us to reduce prices or increase capital and other expenditures or cause us to lose sales volume, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    In many of our markets, our primary competitors have greater financial, marketing, production and distribution resources than we do, and may be more diverse in terms of their geographies and brand portfolios. In all of the markets in which we operate, aggressive marketing strategies, such as reduced pricing, brand positioning, and increased capital or other investments by these competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, continuing consolidation among major global brewers and between brewers and other beverage companies may lead to stronger or new competitors, loss of partner brands, negative impacts on our distributor networks and pressures from marketing and pricing tactics by competitors. Further, consolidation of distributors in our industry could reduce our ability to promote our brands in the markets in a manner that enhances rather than diminishes our brands' value, as well as reduce our ability to manage our pricing effectively and efficiently. Additionally, due to competition with brewers and other beverage companies, an increase in the purchasing power of our large competitors may cause further pricing pressures which could prevent us from increasing prices to recover higher costs necessary to compete. Such pressures could have a material adverse impact on our business and our financial results and market share. Failure to generate significant cost savings and margin improvement through our ongoing initiatives could adversely affect our profitability. Increased pressures for reduced pricing or difficulties in increasing prices while remaining competitive within our markets, as well as the need for increased capital investment, marketing and other expenditures could result in lower margins or loss of market share and volumes. Moreover, most of our major markets are mature, so growth opportunities may be more limited to us than to our global competitors. For example, sales in North America accounted for approximately 80% of our total 2019 sales.    Our success as an enterprise currently depends largely on the success of relatively few products in several mature markets specific to the beer industry; if consumer preferences shift away from our products, consumption of our products decline or we are unable to successfully and timely innovate beyond beer, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.    Our Coors Light and Miller Lite brands in the U.S., Coors Light, Molson Canadian, Coors Banquet and Carling brands in Canada, and Carling, Staropramen, Jelen, Bergenbier and Coors Light brands in Europe represented more than half of each respective segment's sales volumes in 2019. Additionally, several of our brands represent a significant share of their respective market, therefore volatility in these markets could disproportionately impact the performance of these brands. Consequently, any material shift in consumer preferences away from these brands, or from the categories in which they compete, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Consumer preferences and tastes may shift away from our brands or beer generally due to, among others, changing taste preferences, demographics, downturn in economic conditions or perceived value, as well as changes in consumers' perception of our brands due to negative publicity, regulatory actions or litigation. Recently, there has been more attention focused on health concerns and the harmful effects of alcoholic beverages which could result in a change in the social acceptability of beer and other alcoholic beverages which could materially impact the consumption of beer and our sales. Additionally, in some of our major markets, specifically the U.S., Canada and Europe, there has been a shift in consumer preferences within the total beer market away from premium brands to ""craft beer"" produced by smaller, regional microbreweries, as well as a shift within the total alcohol beverage market from beer to wine and spirits. More recently, the rapid growth of hard seltzers in the U.S. may have shifted some consumers away from our brands and beer generally. Moreover, several of our major markets are mature and we have a significant share in such markets, therefore, small movements in consumer preference, such as consumer shifts away from premium light brands, can also disproportionately impact our results. Although the ultimate impact is currently unknown, the emergence of legal cannabis in certain U.S. states and Canada may result in a shift of discretionary income away from our products or a change in consumer preferences away from beer. As a result, a shift in consumer preferences away from our products or beer or a decline in the consumption of our products could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Furthermore, as part of our revitalization plan, our future topline growth will depend, in part, on our ability to timely innovate and develop new products beyond traditional beer. In connection with our revitalization plan, we plan to innovate, test and scale products faster than we have before. However, the launch and ongoing success of new products are inherently uncertain, especially with respect to consumer appeal. The launch of a new product can give rise to a variety of costs and an 21Table of Contentsunsuccessful launch or short-lived popularity of our product innovations could, among other things, affect consumer perception of our existing brands and our reputation as well as result in inventory write-offs and other costs. Our inability to attract consumers to our product innovations relative to our competitors’ products, especially over time, could negatively affect our growth, business, and financial results.    The success of our business relies heavily on brand image, reputation, product quality and protection of intellectual property.    It is important that we maintain and increase the image and reputation of our existing brands and products. Concerns about product quality, even when unsubstantiated, could be harmful to our image and the reputation of our brands and products. While we have quality control programs in place, in the event we or our third-party manufacturers experienced an issue with product quality or if any of our products become unsafe or unfit for consumption, are misbranded or cause injury, we may experience recalls or liability in addition to business disruption which could further negatively impact brand image and reputation, negatively affect our sales and cause us to incur additional costs. A widespread product recall, multiple product recalls or a significant product liability judgment could cause our products to be unavailable for a period, which could further reduce consumer demand and brand equity. Our brand image and reputation may also be more difficult to protect due to less oversight and control as a result of the outsourcing of some of our operations. We also could be exposed to lawsuits relating to product liability, marketing or sales practices or intellectual property infringement. Deterioration to our brand equity may be difficult to combat or reverse and could have a material effect on our business and financial results. In addition, because our brands carry family names, personal activities by certain members of the Molson or Coors families that harm their public image or reputation could also have an adverse effect on our brands. Further, our success is dependent on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, including trademarks, patents, domain names, trade secrets and know-how. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be sufficient or that third parties will not infringe upon or misappropriate these rights or that other parties may claim that our brands infringe on their intellectual property rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Weak, or weakening of, economic or other negative conditions in the markets in which we do business, including reductions in discretionary consumer spending, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Beer consumption in many of our markets is closely tied to general economic conditions and a significant portion of our portfolio consists of premium and above premium brands. Difficult macroeconomic conditions in our markets, such as decreases in per capita income and level of disposable income driven by increases to inflation, income taxes, the cost of living, unemployment levels, political or economic instability or other country-specific factors could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products. For example, a trend towards value brands in certain of our markets or deterioration of the current economic conditions could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. A significant portion of our consolidated net sales revenues are concentrated in the U.S. Therefore, unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, such as a recession or slowed economic growth, in the U.S. could negatively affect consumer demand for our product in this important market. Under difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products or by shifting away from our products to lower-priced products offered by other companies. Softer consumer demand for our products, particularly in the U.S., could reduce our profitability and could negatively affect our overall financial performance.        Our restructuring activities related to our revitalization plan may not be successful and the estimated costs associated with such activities may be more than expected, and our restructuring activities may adversely impact employee hiring and retention.    On October 28, 2019, as part of the revitalization plan, we made the determination to establish Chicago, Illinois as our North American operational headquarters, close our existing office in Denver, Colorado and consolidate certain administrative functions into our other existing office locations. In connection with these consolidation activities, we expect to incur certain cash and non-cash restructuring charges related to employee relocation, severance, retention and transition costs, non-cash asset related costs, lease exit costs in connection with office leases in Denver, Colorado, and other transition activities currently estimated in the range of approximately $120 million to $180 million in the aggregate, the majority of which will be cash charges that we began recognizing in the fourth quarter of 2019, and will be further spread through the balance of fiscal years 2020 and 2021. In 2019, we recognized aggregate special charges of approximately $43 million related to this estimated range, comprised primarily of severance and retention charges of which approximately $40 million remained accrued as of December 31, 2019. These expenses will adversely impact our results of operations during the relevant periods and will reduce our cash position. Additionally, the amount of these estimated expenses, as well as our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings, revitalization plan goals and other benefits of our restructuring activities, are subject to various assumptions and uncertainties. We may also experience additional costs in connection with these restructuring activities due to delays or other unforeseen circumstances. There is no assurance that we will successfully implement, or fully realize the anticipated costs and other benefits of our restructuring activities or execute successfully on our restructuring plan, in the time frames we desire or at all. If we fail to realize the anticipated benefits, including ongoing cost savings, or if we incur charges or costs in amounts that are greater than anticipated, our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.22Table of ContentsIn addition, in connection with the announcement that we plan to consolidate our office locations, we have experienced attrition in our workforce. As a result, we will be required to hire and train new employees to replace certain employees who were affected by our restructuring activities. The increased turnover in our employees could distract management and others from the operation of our business and make it more difficult to retain and hire new talent. The turnover and any resulting distraction could also negatively impact the overall performance of our employees, resulting in inefficiencies, higher short- or long-term costs, or decreased productivity. As a result of these or other similar risks, our business, plans, strategies, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected. Our significant debt level subjects us to financial and operating risks, and the agreements governing such debt subject us to financial and operating covenants and restrictions.    Our indebtedness subjects us to various financial and operating covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions on priority indebtedness, leverage thresholds, liens, certain types of secured debt and certain types of sale lease-back transactions and transfers of assets, each of which may limit our flexibility in responding to our business needs. If we are not able to maintain compliance with stated financial covenants or if we breach other covenants in any debt agreement, we could be in default under such agreement. Such a default would adversely affect our credit ratings, may allow our creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness, and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. Our significant debt level and the terms of such debt could, among other things:     •make it more difficult to satisfy our obligations under the terms of our indebtedness;    •limit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us, or at all;    •limit our flexibility to plan for and adjust to changing business and market conditions, including successfully  execute our revitalization plan, and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•require us to make unfavorable changes to our current financing structure;•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to make interest and principal payments on our     debt, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future acquisitions, working capital, business     activities, and other general corporate requirements;•limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, strategic     opportunities, including acquisitions or other investments, to fund growth or for general corporate purposes,     even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity, particularly if any ratings assigned to our debt securitiesby rating organizations were revised downward; and•adversely impact our competitive position in the industry.    In addition, certain of our current and future debt and derivative financial instruments have or, in the future, could have interest rates that are tied to reference interest rates, such as the LIBOR. The volatility and availability of such reference rates are out of our control. Accordingly, changes to or the unavailability of such rates, could result in increases to the cost of debt which would negatively affect our profitability. For example, in 2017, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority announced that after 2021 it would no longer persuade or compel panel banks to submit the rates required to calculate LIBOR, and it is unclear whether the banks currently reporting information used to set LIBOR will stop doing so after 2021. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect any discontinuance, modification or other reforms to LIBOR or any other reference rate, or the establishment of alternative reference rates will have on us. However, should LIBOR no longer be available or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from their current form, our borrowing costs could increase, which would negatively affect our profitability, and the attractiveness of borrowings under our current credit facility or future debt issuances could diminish, thereby limiting our access to capital.A deterioration in our credit rating could increase our borrowing rates or have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain future financing or refinance current debt.    Ratings agencies may downgrade our credit ratings below their current investment grade levels if we are unable to meet our deleveraging commitments. While we have publicly expressed our intention to maintain an investment grade debt rating, ratings are determined by third-party rating agencies. A credit ratings downgrade, particularly a downgrade below investment grade, could increase our costs of future borrowing and harm our ability to refinance our debt in the future on acceptable terms or access the capital markets.     23Table of ContentsDefault by, or failure of, one or more of our counterparty financial institutions could cause us to incur significant losses.    As part of our risk management activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, including, among others, forward contracts, commodity swap contracts, option contracts, with various financial institutions. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by, or failure of, counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to retrieve our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty's liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings.     Our operations face significant exposure to changes in commodity prices, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.    We use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials, some of which are purchased through supply contracts with third parties, to produce our products, including barley, malted barley, hops, corn, other various starches, water and packaging materials, including aluminum cans and bottles, glass and polyethylene terephthalate containers, as well as, cardboard and other paper products. We also use a significant amount of diesel fuel, natural gas and electricity in our operations. The supply and price of these raw materials and commodities can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including market demand, alternative sources for suppliers, global geopolitical events (especially as to their impact on crude oil prices and the resulting impact on diesel fuel prices), trade agreements among producing and consuming nations, governmental regulations, including tariffs, frosts, droughts and other weather conditions, changes in precipitation patterns, the frequency of extreme weather events, economic factors affecting growth decisions, inflation, plant diseases, theft and industry surcharges and other practices. For example, in June 2018, U.S. tariffs on aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and EU went into effect (though the U.S. lifted the aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico in May 2019), which has created volatility in the price of aluminum in the U.S. and increased the price of aluminum used in some of our product packaging. In addition, our North America business unit is exposed to variability in the market price of a regional premium differential (referred to as “Midwest Premium” in the U.S.) charged by industry participants to deliver aluminum from the smelter to the manufacturing facility. This premium differential also fluctuates in relation to several conditions, including based on the supply of and demand for aluminum in a particular region, associated transportation costs and warehouse financing transactions, which limit the amount of physical aluminum available to consumers and increases the price differential as a result. During times of greater volatility in the Midwest Premium, the variability in our cost of goods sold can also increase. In addition to impacting the price we pay for the raw materials we purchase, changing premium differentials impact our end consumers as we must either pass on the increased cost to those consumers or experience a decrease in our profit margins as a result of the Midwest Premium differential. Increases in the Midwest Premium, or the inability to pass through any fluctuation in aluminum prices or regional premiums to our end consumers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. To the extent any of the foregoing factors affect the availability or prices of ingredients or packaging or our hedging arrangements do not effectively or completely hedge changes in commodity price risks and we are not able to pass these increased costs along to customers, our business and financial results could be materially adversely impacted.Unfavorable outcomes of legal or regulatory proceedings may adversely affect our business and financial condition.    We are from time to time involved in or subject to legal or regulatory proceedings related to our business. Such proceedings can be complex, costly, and highly disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and other key personnel. The assessment of the outcome of such proceedings, including our potential liability, if any, is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events that are not within our control. The outcome of litigation, arbitration, regulatory or other proceedings, including amounts ultimately received or paid upon judgment or settlement, may differ materially from management’s outlook or estimates, including any amounts accrued in the financial statements. Actual outcomes, including judgments, awards, settlements or orders, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flows.We may incur impairments of the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    In connection with various business combinations, we have historically allocated material amounts of the related purchase prices to goodwill and other intangible assets that are considered to have indefinite useful lives. For example, as a result of the Acquisition, we allocated approximately $6.3 billion and $7.6 billion to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively. These assets are tested for impairment at least annually, using estimates and assumptions affected by factors such as economic and industry conditions and changes in operating performance. Additionally, in conjunction with the brand impairment tests, we also reassess each brand's indefinite-life classification. Potential resulting charges from an impairment of goodwill or brand intangible, as well as reclassification of an indefinite-lived to a definite-lived brand intangible, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, we identified a triggering event requiring an interim impairment assessment of the goodwill within our Canada 24Table of Contentsreporting unit at the end of the third quarter of 2019, which resulted in a goodwill impairment loss of $668.3 million recorded within special items in our consolidated statements of operations during the third quarter of 2019. Furthermore, in the fourth quarter of 2016, an impairment loss of $495.2 million was recorded on the Molson core brand indefinite-lived intangible assets and it was determined that the Molson core brands had characteristics that had evolved which indicated a definite-life was more appropriate. These brands were therefore reclassified as definite-lived intangible assets and are being amortized over useful lives ranging from 30 to 50 years.    Our most recent impairment analysis, conducted as of October 1, 2019, the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter, indicated that the fair value of the U.S., Europe and Canada reporting units were estimated at approximately 17%, 12% and 0% in excess of their carrying values, respectively. In the current year testing, it was determined that the fair value of the U.S. and Canada reporting units declined during the year, while there was a slight increase in the fair value of the Europe reporting unit versus the prior year. As a result of our testing, the Europe and Canada reporting units continue to be considered at risk of future impairment in the event of significant unfavorable changes in the forecasted cash flows (including prolonged weakening of economic conditions, or significant unfavorable changes in tax, environmental or other regulations, including interpretations thereof), terminal growth rates, market multiples and/or weighted-average cost of capital utilized in the discounted cash flow analyses. The Canada Coors Light distribution agreement indefinite-lived intangible asset is also considered to be at risk of future impairment with a fair value estimated at approximately 11% in excess of its carrying value as of the impairment testing date. Although the fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets are either equal to or in excess of their carrying values, the fair values are sensitive to the aforementioned potential unfavorable changes that could have an adverse impact on future analyses. Any future impairment of the U.S., Europe or Canada reporting units or brands, or reclassification of indefinite-lived brands to definite-lived, may result in material charges that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results, as evidenced by the charges incurred during the third quarter of 2019 and fourth quarter of 2016, as previously noted above. The testing of our goodwill for impairment is also predicated upon our determination of our reporting units. Any change to the conclusion of our reporting units or the aggregation of components within our reporting units could result in a different outcome to our annual impairment test. See Part II—Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Critical Accounting Estimates and Part II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 10, ""Goodwill and Intangible Assets"" for additional information related to the results of our annual impairment testing.Termination of one or more manufacturer/distribution/production agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    We manufacture and/or distribute products of other beverage companies through various joint venture, licensing, distribution, contract brewing or other similar arrangements, such as our agreement to import, market, distribute and sell certain Heineken brands in Canada, our arrangements with ABI to brew and distribute Beck's, Stella Artois, Lowenbrau and Spaten and to distribute Hoegaarden, Leffe, and Corona in Central Europe. We also have agreements with Asahi for the production and import of Pilsner Urquell and Peroni Nastro Azurro into the U.S. under perpetual royalty-free license. These agreements have varying expiration dates and performance criteria, with several agreements approaching expiration in the near future. Non-renewal of these agreements or loss of one more or more of these arrangements, because of failure of performance, failure to come to terms on a negotiated extension, as a result of industry consolidation or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Changes in various supply chain standards or agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Our business includes various joint venture and industry agreements which standardize parts of the supply chain system. An example includes our warehousing and customer delivery systems in Canada organized under joint venture agreements with other brewers. Any negative change in these agreements or material terms within these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    We rely on a small number of suppliers to obtain the packaging materials we need to operate our business. The inability to obtain materials could unfavorably affect our ability to produce our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    We purchase certain types of packaging materials, including aluminum cans and bottles, glass bottles and paperboard from a small number of suppliers. Consolidation of packaging materials suppliers has reduced local supply alternatives and increased risks of supply disruptions. The inability of any of these suppliers to meet our production requirements without sufficient time to develop an alternative source could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Additionally, if the financial condition of these suppliers deteriorates our business and financial results could be adversely impacted. Our suppliers’ financial condition is affected in large part by conditions and events that are beyond our and their control, including: competitive and general market conditions in the locations in which they operate; the availability of capital and other financing resources on reasonable terms; loss of major customers; or disruptions of bottling operations that may be caused by strikes, work stoppages, labor unrest or natural disasters. A deterioration of the financial condition or results of operations of one or more of our major suppliers could adversely affect our business and financial results.25Table of Contents    Risks associated with operating our joint ventures may materially adversely affect our business and financial results.    We have entered into several joint ventures, including our joint ventures with Ball Corporation (i.e. Rocky Mountain Metal Container), and with Owens-Brockway Glass Container Inc. (i.e. Rocky Mountain Bottle Company), for a portion of our aluminum and glass packaging supply in the U.S. We may enter into additional joint ventures in the future. Our joint venture partners may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or with the goals of the joint venture. In addition, we compete against our joint venture partners in certain of our other markets. Disagreements with our business partners may impede our ability to maximize the benefits of our partnerships. Our joint venture arrangements may require us, among other matters, to pay certain costs or to make certain capital investments or to seek our joint venture partner's consent to take certain actions. In addition, our joint venture partners may be unable or unwilling to meet their economic or other obligations under the operative documents, and we may be required to either fulfill those obligations alone to ensure the ongoing success of a joint venture or to dissolve and liquidate a joint venture.     Our operations in developing and emerging markets expose us to additional risks which could harm our business and financial results.    We expect our operations in developing and emerging markets to become more significant to our operating results as we continue to further expand internationally, including in connection with our acquisition of the Miller International Business. In certain of these markets, we have limited operating experience and may not succeed. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our operations in these markets expose us to additional risks, including: changes in local political, economic, social and labor conditions; restrictions on foreign ownership and investments; repatriation of cash earned in countries outside the U.S.; import and export requirements; increased costs to ensure compliance with complex foreign laws and regulations; currency exchange rate fluctuations; a less developed and less certain legal and regulatory environment, which among other things can create uncertainty with regard to liability issues; longer payment cycles, increased credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud; and other challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences.    In addition, as a global company, we are subject to foreign and U.S. laws and regulations designed to combat governmental corruption, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, each of which could have a materially negative effect on our reputation, brands and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, there can be no assurance that our employees, business partners or agents will not violate our policies.Changes to the regulation of the distribution systems for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results.    Many countries in which we operate regulate the distribution of alcohol products and if those regulations were changed, it could alter our business practices and have material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, in the U.S. market, there is a three-tier distribution system that governs the sale of malt beverage products. That system, consisting of required separation of manufacturers, distributors and retailers, dates back to the repeal of prohibition and is periodically subject to legal challenges. To the extent that such challenges are successful and allow changes to the three-tier system, such changes could have a material adverse effect on our U.S. segment results of operations. Further, in Canada, our products are required to be distributed through each province's respective provincial liquor board. Additionally, in certain Canadian provinces, we rely on our joint venture arrangements, such as BRI and BDL, to distribute our products via retail outlets that are mandated and regulated by provincial government regulators. BRI owns and operates commercial retail outlets, known as The Beer Store, in Ontario, and BDL facilitates the distribution of our products in the western Canadian provinces. If provincial regulation should change, the costs to adjust our distribution methods could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Our consolidated financial statements are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, most significantly the Canadian dollar and the European operating currencies such as, Euro, British Pound, Czech Koruna, Croatian Kuna, Serbian Dinar, New Romanian Leu, Bulgarian Lev and Hungarian Forint.    We hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in different currencies, most significantly in Canada and throughout Europe. Because our financial statements are presented in USD, we must translate our assets, liabilities, income and expenses into USD. Increases and decreases in the value of the USD will affect, perhaps adversely, the value of these items in our financial statements, even if their local currency value has not changed. Additionally, we are exposed to currency transaction risks related to transactions denominated in currencies other than one of the functional currencies of our operating entities, such as the purchase of certain raw material inputs or capital expenditures, as well as sales transactions and debt issuances or other incurred obligations. Further, certain actions by the government of any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our results and  financial position. To the extent that we fail to adequately manage these risks through our risk management policies intended to protect our exposure to currency movements, which may affect our operations, including if our hedging arrangements do not 26Table of Contentseffectively or completely hedge changes in foreign currency rates, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. For example, as a result of the U.K. vote in 2016 to leave the European Union, the GBP experienced a significant decline in comparison to USD and EUR and may continue to be volatile. Any significant further weakening of the GBP to the USD, including in connection with the uncertainty regarding the future trade agreements following the U.K.'s exit from the European Union, will have an adverse impact on our European revenues as reported in USD due to the importance and relative magnitude of U.K. sales. Additionally, the strengthening of the USD against the Canadian dollar, European currencies and various other global currencies would adversely impact our USD reported results due to the impact on foreign currency translation.Changes in tax, environmental, trade or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing, trade and other regulations could cause volatility or have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Our business is highly regulated by national, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in various jurisdictions regarding such matters as tariffs, licensing requirements, trade and pricing practices, labeling, advertising, promotion and marketing practices, relationships with distributors, environmental matters, ingredient regulations, and other matters. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent re-evaluation, varying interpretations and political debate and inquiries from government regulators charged with their enforcement, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, on December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Act was enacted in the U.S. This enactment resulted in a number of significant changes to U.S. federal income tax law for U.S. corporations. Most notably, the statutory federal corporate income tax rate was changed from 35% to 21% for corporations and, as a result, we recorded an estimated net tax benefit of approximately $567 million in our consolidated statements of operations during the fourth quarter of 2017 driven by the effects of the 2017 Tax Act on our deferred tax positions as of December 31, 2017. Additionally, since 2018, the U.S. Department of Treasury has continued to issue proposed, temporary and final regulations to implement provisions of the 2017 Tax Act. We have continued to monitor these and while temporary and final regulations have not yet resulted in material adverse impacts to us, there are certain proposed regulations, which are not yet considered law, that if finalized as proposed, could result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. Specifically, if certain of the proposed regulations are finalized as proposed with full retroactive application to January 1, 2018, then we would be required to recognize estimated income tax expense of approximately $100 million to $200 million upon enactment related to the proposed retroactive period through December 31, 2019, for fiscal years 2018 and 2019. This estimated range contains significant uncertainty and could be impacted by various factors, including any differences between the proposed and ultimately finalized regulations. Separately, in December 2018, the U.S. Department of Treasury issued a regulation that impacts our ability to claim a refund of certain federal duties, taxes, and fees paid for beer sold between the U.S. and certain other countries effective as of February 2019, and, as a result, based on the terms of the regulation, it is the U.S Department of Treasury's view that future claims will no longer be accepted, and further, we may be unable to collect approximately $40 million in historically claimed, but not yet received, refunds, which would negatively impact our revenue. In January 2020, the United States Court of International Trade issued an opinion and order ruling the challenged portions of this regulation dealing with refunds of certain federal duties, taxes and fees paid with respect to certain imported beer, to the extent of certain exported beer, to be unlawful. The U.S. Department of Treasury has until February 18, 2020 to provide a response to the proposed final judgment.  Additionally, modifications of U.S. laws and policies governing foreign trade and investment, including trade agreements and tariffs such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (a new trade agreement between the U.S. government and the Canadian and Mexican governments which will replace the North American Free Trade Agreement when ratified), or aluminum tariffs, could adversely affect our supply chain, business and results of operations. For example, in June 2018, U.S. tariffs on aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and EU went into effect (though the U.S. lifted the aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico in May 2019), which has created volatility in the price of aluminum in the U.S. and increased the price of aluminum used in some of our product packaging. Continued imposition of U.S. aluminum tariffs, the implementation of additional tariffs and retaliatory tariffs from trade partners or related uncertainties could further increase the cost of certain of our imported materials, thereby adversely affecting our profitability. Furthermore, various jurisdictions have adopted, or may seek to adopt, additional product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the availability of our beverages relating to perceived adverse health consequences of some of our beverages. If additional or more severe requirements of this type are imposed on one or more of our beverages under current or future laws or regulations, they could inhibit sales of such beverages in such jurisdictions. In addition, we cannot predict whether our beverages will become subject to increased rules and regulations regarding labeling or warnings which, if enacted, could increase our costs or adversely impact sales.Failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or changes in these laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof, or in tax, environmental, excise tax levels imposed or any other laws or regulations could result in the loss, revocation or suspension of our licenses, permits or approvals and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition 27Table of Contentsand results of operations. Additionally, uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of, and potential future developments in, complex domestic and international tax laws and regulations, the amount and timing of future taxable income and the interaction of such laws and regulations among jurisdictions. Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded.     Climate change and other weather events may negatively affect our business and financial results.    Our business depends, in large part, upon agricultural activity and natural resources. There is concern that carbon monoxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global average temperatures, which could cause significant changes in global weather patterns and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Changing weather patterns and more volatile weather conditions could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions which may impact quality, limit availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities, such as hops, barley and other cereal grains, which are important ingredients for our products. Furthermore, should weather patterns in our markets shift from warm or high temperatures to unseasonably cool or wet weather, consumption of our products may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain, distribution networks and routes to market, or impact demand for our products. In addition, public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. Concern over climate change may result in new or increased regional, federal and global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases, or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns. In the event that such regulation is more stringent than current regulatory obligations or the measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor and improve our energy efficiency and water conservation, we may experience disruptions in, or increases in our costs of, operation and delivery and we may be required to make additional investments in facilities and equipment or relocate our facilities. In particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could increase the cost of energy, including fuel, required to operate our facilities or transport and distribute our products, thereby increasing the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. As a result, the effects of climate change or water scarcity could negatively affect our business and operations. In addition, any failure to achieve our goals with respect to reducing our impact on the environment or perception (whether or not valid) of our failure to act responsibly with respect to water use and the environment or to effectively respond to new, or changes in, legal or regulatory requirements concerning climate change or water scarcity could result in adverse publicity and could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. There is also increased focus, including by governmental and non-governmental organizations, investors, customers and consumers on these and other environmental sustainability matters, including deforestation, land use, climate impact and water use. Our reputation could be damaged if we or others in our industry do not act, or are perceived not to act, responsibly with respect to our impact on the environment. An inadequate supply or availability or quality water could have a material adverse effect on, among other things, our sales, production processes, other costs and, in turn, profitability.    Quality water is a key ingredient in our brewing process. Clean water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and climate change may increase water scarcity and cause a deterioration of water quality in areas where we maintain brewing operations. The competition for water among domestic, agricultural and manufacturing users is increasing in some of our brewing communities. Even where water is widely available, water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain our operations. Further, unavailability of clean water at our breweries could limit our ability to brew, which could cause a decrease in production.We and our suppliers are dependent on sufficient amounts of quality water for operation of our breweries and key facilities and the key facilities of our significant suppliers. The suppliers of the agricultural raw materials we purchase are also dependent upon sufficient supplies of quality water for their fields. A substantial reduction in water in certain agricultural areas could result in material losses of crops, such as barley or hops, which could lead to a shortage of our product supply. If water available to our operations or the operations of our suppliers becomes scarce or the quality of that water deteriorates, we may incur increased production costs or face production constraints. Loss, operational disruptions or closure of a major brewery or other key facility, due to unforeseen or catastrophic events or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Our business could be interrupted and our financial results could be materially adversely impacted by physical risks such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, terror attacks and other natural disasters or catastrophic events that damage or destroy one of our breweries or key facilities or the key facilities of our significant suppliers. If any of our breweries or key facilities or the key facilities of our significant suppliers were to experience a significant operational disruption or catastrophic loss, it could delay or disrupt production, shipments and revenue, and result in potentially significant expenses to repair or replace these properties. 28Table of ContentsAdditionally, certain catastrophes are not covered by our general insurance policies, which could result in significant unrecoverable losses. Furthermore, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted by under-investment in physical assets or production capacity, including contract brewing and effect on priority of our brands if production capacity is limited. Further, significant excess capacity at any of our breweries as a result of increased efficiencies in our supply chain process or continued volume declines, could result in under-utilization of our assets, which could lead to excess overhead expenses or additional costs incurred associated with the closure of one or more of our facilities. For example, as part of a strategic review of our supply chain network, certain breweries and bottling lines were closed in recent years, and we have and continue to incur brewery closure costs, including charges associated with the planned closure of the Irwindale brewery in 2020. We regularly review our supply chain network to ensure that our supply chain capacity is aligned with the needs of the business. Such reviews could potentially result in further closures and the related costs could be material.    Failure to successfully identify, complete or integrate attractive acquisitions and joint ventures into our existing operations could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.    We have made a number of acquisitions and entered into several strategic joint ventures. In order to compete in the consolidating global brewing industry, we anticipate that we may, from time to time, in the future acquire additional businesses or enter into additional joint ventures that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our business such as the Acquisition and our Canadian business' joint venture with HEXO and the various other craft acquisitions we have made recently. Potential risks associated with acquisitions and joint ventures could include, among other things: our ability to identify attractive acquisitions and joint ventures; our ability to offer potential acquisition targets and joint venture partners' competitive transaction terms; our ability to raise capital on reasonable terms to finance attractive acquisitions and joint ventures; our ability to realize the benefits or cost savings that we expect to realize as a result of the acquisition or joint venture; diversion of management's attention; our ability to successfully integrate our businesses with the business of the acquired company; motivating, recruiting and retaining key employees; conforming standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures among our company and the acquired company; consolidating and streamlining sales, marketing and corporate operations; potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies; potential exposure to unknown or future liabilities or costs that affect the markets in which acquired companies or joint ventures operate; reputational or other damage due to the conduct of a joint venture partner; loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business; and managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations following completion of an acquisition or entry into a joint venture. Poor investment performance of pension plan holdings and other factors impacting pension plan costs could unfavorably affect our business, liquidity and our financial results.    Our costs of providing defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on the plans' assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, exchange rate fluctuations, government regulation, court rulings or other changes in legal requirements, global equity prices, and our required and/or voluntary contributions to the plans. While we comply with the minimum funding requirements, we have certain qualified pension plans with obligations which exceed the value of the plans' assets. These funding requirements also may require contributions even when there is no reported deficit. Without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans' assets, and depending upon the other factors as listed above, we could be required to fund the plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations (or the timing of such contributions) could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, credit rating, cost of borrowing, financial position and/or results of operations. For example, following the completion of the triennial review of the U.K. pension plan with the plan's trustees in 2014, we made a GBP 150 million contribution to our U.K. pension plan in January 2015, based on the underfunded status of the plan and the evaluation of the plan's performance and long-term obligations. In addition, we made pension plan contributions during 2017 of approximately $310 million, including $200 million of discretionary contributions to the U.S. pension plan.    We depend on key personnel, the loss of whom could harm our business.    The loss of the services and expertise of any key employee could harm our business. Our future success depends on our ability to identify, attract and retain qualified personnel on a timely basis. Turnover of senior management can adversely impact our stock price, our results of operations and our client relationships and may make recruiting for future management positions more difficult. In addition, we must successfully integrate any new management personnel that we hire within our organization, or who join our organization as a result of an acquisition, in order to achieve our operating objectives, and changes in other key management positions may temporarily affect our financial performance and results of operations as new management becomes familiar with our business. Due to a high concentration of workers represented by unions or trade councils in Canada, Europe, and the U.S., we could be significantly affected by labor strikes, work stoppages or other employee-related issues.    As of December 31, 2019, approximately 45%, 35%, and 30% of our Canadian, European and U.S. workforces, respectively, are represented by trade unions or councils. Stringent labor laws in certain of our key markets expose us to a greater risk of loss should we experience labor disruptions in those markets. A prolonged labor strike, work stoppage or other employee-related issue, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, in the first quarter of 2017, our Toronto 29Table of Contentsbrewery unionized employees commenced a labor strike initiated from on-going negotiations of the collective bargaining agreement. This labor strike resulted in slower than expected production at the Toronto brewery in the first quarter of 2017. From time to time, our collective bargaining agreements come due for renegotiation, and, if we are unable to timely complete negotiations, affected employees may strike, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.Because of our reliance on third-party service providers and internal and outsourced systems for our information technology and certain other administrative functions, we could experience a disruption to our business.    We rely extensively on information services providers worldwide for our information technology functions including network, help desk, hardware and software configuration. Additionally, we rely on internal networks and information systems and other technology, including the internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement and supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments. We use information systems for certain human resource activities and to process our employee benefits, as well as to process financial information for internal and external reporting purposes and to comply with various reporting, legal and tax requirements. As information systems are critical to many of our operating activities, our business may be impacted by system shutdowns, service disruptions, obsolescence, or security breaches. Additionally, if one of our service providers were to fail and we were unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner, we could be unable to properly administer our outsourced functions. A breach of our information systems could cause material financial or reputational harm.    Our information systems may be the target of cyber-attacks or other security breaches, which, if successful, could, among other things, expose us to the loss of key business, employee, customer or vendor information, cause us to breach our legal, regulatory or contractual obligations, create an inability to access or rely upon critical business records or cause a disruption of our operations. These breaches may result from human errors, equipment failure, or fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties. If our information systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results and we may lose revenue and profits as a result of our inability to timely manufacture, distribute, invoice and collect payments from our customers. We expend significant financial resources to protect against threats and cyber-attacks and may be required to further expend financial resources to alleviate problems caused by physical, electronic and cyber security breaches. As techniques used to breach security are growing in frequency and sophistication and are generally not recognized until launched against a target, regardless of our expenditures and protection efforts, we may not be able to implement security measures in a timely manner or, if and when implemented, these measures could be circumvented. Misuse, leakage or falsification of information could result in a violation of data privacy laws and regulations, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, damage our reputation and credibility or expose us to increased risk of lawsuits, loss of existing or potential future customers and/or increases in our security costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information and may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight or consumers may avoid our brands due to negative publicity. We could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In the event of a breach resulting in loss of data, such as personally identifiable information or other such data protected by data privacy or other laws, we may be liable for damages, fines and penalties for such losses under applicable regulatory frameworks despite not handling the data. Further, the regulatory framework around data custody, data privacy and breaches varies by jurisdiction and is an evolving area of law. We may not be able to limit our liability or damages in the event of such a loss.If Pentland and the Coors Trust do not agree on a matter submitted to our stockholders or if a super-majority of our board of directors do not agree on certain actions, generally the matter will not be approved, even if beneficial to us or favored by other stockholders or a majority of our board of directors.    Pentland Securities (1981) Inc. (""Pentland"") (a company controlled by the Molson family and related parties) and the Adolph Coors, Jr. Trust (the ""Coors Trust"") (a trust controlled by the Coors family and related parties), which together control more than 90% of our Class A common stock and Class A exchangeable shares, have a voting trust agreement through which they have combined their voting power over the shares of our Class A common stock and the Class A exchangeable shares that they own. If these two stockholders do not agree to vote in favor of a matter submitted to a stockholder vote (other than the election of directors), the voting trustees are required to vote all of the Class A common stock and Class A exchangeable shares deposited in the voting trust against the matter. There is no other mechanism in the voting trust agreement to resolve a potential deadlock between these stockholders. Therefore, if either Pentland or the Coors Trust is unwilling to vote in favor of a proposal that is subject to a stockholder vote, we would be unable to implement the proposal even if our board of directors, management or other stockholders believe the proposal is beneficial to us. Similarly, our bylaws require the authorization of a super-majority (two-thirds) of the board of directors to take 30Table of Contentscertain transformational actions. Thus, it is possible that the Company will not be authorized to take action even if it is supported by a simple majority of the board of directors.    The interests of the controlling stockholders may differ from those of other stockholders and could prevent the Company from making certain decisions or taking certain actions that would be in the best interest of the other stockholders.    Our Class B common stock has fewer voting rights than our Class A common stock and holders of our Class A common stock have the ability to effectively control or have a significant influence over certain company actions requiring stockholder approval, which could have a material adverse effect on Class B stockholders. See Part II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 8, ""Stockholders' Equity"" for additional information regarding voting rights of Class A and Class B stockholders.    Changes in the social acceptability of alcohol, perceptions of our products and the political view of the alcohol beverage industry may harm our business.    The alcoholic beverage industry is regularly the subject of anti-alcohol activist activity related to the health concerns from the misuse of alcohol and concerns regarding underage drinking and exposure to alcohol advertisements. In addition, in recent years, there has been an increase in public and political attention on health and well-being as it relates to the alcohol beverage and other industries. Negative publicity regarding beer and changes in consumer perceptions in relation to beer and other alcoholic beverages, could adversely affect the sale and consumption of our products which could, in turn, adversely affect our business and financial conditions. Additionally, the concerns around alcohol as well as health and well-being could result in unfavorable regulations or other legal requirements in certain of our markets, such as advertising, selling and other restrictions, increased taxes associated with our sales, or the establishment of minimum unit pricing. Any such regulations or requirements could change consumer and customer purchasing patterns, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. In particular, advocates of prohibition and other severe restrictions on the marketing and sales of alcohol are becoming increasingly organized and coordinated on a global basis, seeking to impose laws or regulations or to bring actions against us, to curtail substantially the consumption of alcohol, including beer, in developed and developing markets. To the extent such views gain traction in regulations of jurisdictions in which we do or plan to do business, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, in early 2016, the government of Bihar, India, the largest state in India in which our International segment operates, announced a complete prohibition on the sale and distribution of alcohol, which resulted in the impairment of assets totaling $30.8 million, recorded during the second quarter of 2016.    Our internal control over financial reporting may not be designed or operate effectively which could result in material misstatements in our financial statements, which could, in turn, have a significant adverse effect on our business and the price of our common stock.    Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). We previously identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, and as a result, management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission in “Internal Control-An Integrated Framework (2013).” We believe this material weakness has been fully addressed by the remediation measures put in place during the 2019 fiscal year. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will not identify additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any of the foregoing may adversely affect our reputation and business and the market price of our common stock.Additional Risks Applicable to the United States SegmentOur U.S. business is highly dependent on independent distributors to sell our products, with no assurance that these distributors will effectively sell our products.    We sell nearly all of our products, including all of our imported products, in the U.S. to independent distributors for resale to retail outlets. These independent distributors are entitled to exclusive territories and protected from termination by state statutes and regulations. Consequently, if we are not allowed, or are unable under acceptable terms or at all, to replace unproductive or inefficient distributors, our business, financial position and results of operation may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Additional Risks Applicable to the Canada SegmentGovernment mandated changes to the retail distribution model resulting from new regulations may have a material adverse effect on our Canada business.    In June 2019, the Ontario government adopted a bill that, if enacted, would terminate a 10-year Master Framework Agreement that was originally signed between the previous government administration and MCBC, Labatt Brewing Company Limited, Sleeman Breweries Ltd., and Brewers Retail Inc. in 2015 and governs the terms of the beer distribution and retail systems in Ontario through 2025. The government has not yet proclaimed the bill as law. The impacts of these potential legislative changes are unknown at this time but could have a negative impact on the results of 31Table of Contentsoperations, cash flows and financial position of the Canada segment. While discussions remain ongoing with the government to reach a mutually agreeable alternative to the enactment of the law, we and the other Master Framework Agreement signatories are prepared to vigorously defend our rights and pursue legal recourse, should the Master Framework Agreement be unilaterally terminated by the enactment of the legislation.Our Canadian business faces numerous risks relating to its joint venture in the Canadian cannabis industry.    In 2018, a wholly-owned subsidiary within our Canadian business completed the formation of an independent Canadian joint venture with HEXO, a Canadian entity listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange that serves the Canadian cannabis market. The joint venture, Truss LP, is developing non-alcoholic, cannabis-infused beverages for the Canadian market subject to obtaining all of the required licenses and regulatory clearances. The success and consumer acceptance of any products produced by the joint venture cannot be assured. Further, our Canadian subsidiary’s involvement in the Canadian cannabis industry may negatively impact: consumer, business partner, investor or public sentiment regarding our brands, Canadian beer business or our company. The emerging cannabis industry in Canada and in other jurisdictions is evolving rapidly and subjects us to a high degree of political, legal and regulatory uncertainty. The occurrence of any of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may experience adverse effects on our Canada business and financial results due to declines in the overall Canadian beer industry, continued price discounting, increased cost of goods sold and higher taxes.    If the Canadian beer market continues to decline, the impact to our financial results could be exacerbated due to our significant share of the overall market. Additionally, continuation or acceleration of price discounting, in Ontario, Québec, Alberta or other provinces, as well as increases in our cost of goods sold, could adversely impact our business. Further, changes in the Canadian tax legislation, such as the potential for an increase in beer excise taxes, could decrease our net sales. Although the ultimate impact is currently unknown, the legalization of cannabis in Canada may result in a shift of discretionary income away from our products or a change in consumer preferences away from beer or our other products. Moreover, the future success and earnings growth of the Canada business depends, in part, on our ability to efficiently conduct our operations. Failure to generate significant cost savings and margin improvement through our ongoing initiatives could adversely affect our profitability.    If we are required to move away from the industry standard returnable bottle we use today, we may incur unexpected losses.    Along with other brewers in Canada, we currently use an industry standard returnable bottle which represents approximately 27% of total volume sales (excluding imports) in Canada. Changes to the Industry Standard Bottle Agreement could impact our use of the industry standard returnable bottle. If we cease to use the industry standard returnable bottle, our current bottle inventory and a portion of our bottle packaging equipment could become obsolete and could result in a material write-off of these assets.             Indemnities provided to the purchaser of our previous interest in the Cervejarias Kaiser Brasil S.A. (""Kaiser"") business in Brazil could result in future cash outflows and statement of operations charges.    In 2006, we sold our previous ownership interest in Kaiser, which was held by our Canadian business, to FEMSA Cerveza S.A. de C.V. (""FEMSA""). The terms of the sale agreement require us to indemnify FEMSA for exposures related to certain tax, civil and labor contingencies and certain purchased tax credits. The ultimate resolution of these claims is not under our control. These indemnity obligations are recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, however, we could incur future statement of operations charges as facts further develop resulting in changes to our estimates or changes in our assessment of probability of loss on these items as well as due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Due to the uncertainty involved in the ultimate outcome and timing of these contingencies, significant adjustments to the carrying value of our indemnity liabilities and corresponding statement of operations charges/credits could result in the future. Additional Risks Applicable to the Europe SegmentThe vote in the U.K. to leave the European Union could adversely affect us.  Approximately 11% of our consolidated net sales in 2019 came from the U.K., which is our largest market in Europe. The U.K. exited the European Union on January 31, 2020, which subjects our Europe segment to regulatory and market uncertainty in the U.K. and in the rest of Europe as the full terms of future trade agreements continue to be negotiated. The U.K. vote to leave the European Union triggered a decline in the GBP in comparison to USD and EUR. Any significant weakening of the GBP to the USD will have an adverse impact on our European revenues as reported in USD due to the importance of U.K. sales. Furthermore, the withdrawal may result in disruption to and decline of the U.K. and European economies. Weakening of economic conditions or economic uncertainties tend to harm the beer business, and if such conditions emerge in the U.K. or in the rest of Europe, it may have a material adverse effect on our Europe segment. The withdrawal may also result in significant disruption in trade and the movement of goods, including prolonged transportation delays, which could negatively affect our ability to source raw materials and packaging for our products as well as our ability to import and export products. Because the terms of the exit are still unknown and will continue to be negotiated during 2020, we face regulatory and market uncertainty and may need to quickly adapt to regulatory changes and market volatility, including potential increased legal and regulatory complexities and 32Table of Contentspotential higher costs of conducting business in the U.K. or the rest of Europe. Any of these effects, among others, could adversely affect our European business, results of operations, and financial condition.     Economic trends and intense competition in European markets could unfavorably affect our profitability.    Our European businesses have been, and, in the future may be, adversely affected by conditions in the global financial markets and general economic and political conditions, as well as a weakening of their respective currencies versus the U.S. dollar. Additionally, we face intense competition in certain of our European markets, particularly with respect to pricing, which could lead to reduced sales or profitability. In particular, the on-going focus by large competitors in Europe to drive increased market share through aggressive pricing strategies could adversely affect our sales and results of operations. In addition, in recent years, beer volume sales in Europe have been shifting from pubs and restaurants (on-premise) to retail stores (off-premise) for the industry in general. Sales to off-premise customers tend to be lower than margins on sales to on-premise customers, and, as a result, continuation or acceleration of this trend would further adversely affect our profitability"
17,TAP,MOLSON COORS BREWING CO,2019-02-12,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORSInvesting in our Company involves risk. The reader should carefully consider the following risk factors and the other information contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks set forth below are those that management believes are most likely to have a material adverse effect on us, however, are not a comprehensive description of the risks facing our Company. We may also be subject to other risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial but may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods. If the following risks or uncertainties, individually or in combination, actually occur, they may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects.Risks Specific to Our CompanyThe global beer industry is constantly evolving, and our position within the global beer industry and our markets in which we operate may fundamentally change. If we do not successfully transform along with the evolving industry and market dynamics, then the result could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    The brewing industry has significantly evolved over the years becoming an increasingly global beer market. For many years, the industry operated primarily on local presence with modest international expansion achieved through export, license and partnership arrangements, whereas it has now become increasingly complex as the global consolidation of brewers has resulted in fewer major market participants. At the same time, smaller local brewers within certain geographies are seeing accelerated growth as consumers increasingly place value on locally-produced and/or regionally-sourced products. As a result of the increased global consolidation of brewers and the dynamic of an expanding new segment within the industry with new market entrants, the markets in which we operate, particularly the more mature markets, may evolve at a disadvantage to our current market position and local governments may intervene, which may fundamentally accelerate transformational changes to such markets. For example, U.S. and Canada beer markets have long consisted of a select number of significant market participants with government-regulated routes to market. However, evolution in these and others of our beer markets together with emerging changes to consumer preferences have introduced a significant expansion of market entrants and resulted in increased consumer choice and market competition, as well as increased government scrutiny. Specifically, in the U.S., Canada and Europe, we have experienced vast expansion in the craft beer industry along with the expansion of cider and flavored malt beverages. If our competitors are able to respond more quickly to the evolving trends within the craft beer, cider and flavored malt beverages categories, or if our new products are not successful, our business and financial results may be adversely impacted. In Canada, changes to interprovincial trade rules, regulations, distribution models, and packaging requirements, such as government-owned retail outlets and industry standard returnable bottles, may be disadvantageous to us. Currently, in Ontario and other provinces, provincial governments are reviewing and/or changing this historical foundation as a result of this market evolution and increased demand by some for government intervention to enhance competition and choice. If we are unsuccessful in evolving with, and navigating through, the changes to the markets in which we operate, there could be a 20Table of Contentsmaterial adverse effect on our business and financial results. See risk factors below under “Risks Specific to the Canadian Segment” for additional risks specific to competition in the Canadian beer market.    Competition in our markets could require us to reduce prices or increase capital and other expenditures or cause us to lose sales volume, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    In many of our markets, our primary competitors have greater financial, marketing, production and distribution resources than we do, and may be more diverse in terms of their geographies and brand portfolios. In all of the markets in which we operate, aggressive marketing strategies, such as reduced pricing, brand positioning, and increased capital or other investments by these competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, continuing consolidation among major global brewers and between brewers and other beverage companies may lead to stronger or new competitors, loss of partner brands, negative impacts on our distributor networks and pressures from marketing and pricing tactics by competitors. Further, consolidation of distributors in our industry could reduce our ability to promote our brands in the market in a manner that enhances rather than diminishes their value, as well as reduce our ability to manage our pricing effectively.  Additionally, due to competition with brewers and other beverage companies, an increase in the purchasing power of our large competitors may cause further pricing pressures which could prevent us from increasing prices to recover higher costs necessary to compete. Such pressures could have a material adverse impact on our business and our financial results and market share. Failure to generate significant cost savings and margin improvement through our ongoing initiatives could adversely affect our profitability. Increased pressures for reduced pricing or difficulties in increasing prices while remaining competitive within our markets, as well as the need for increased capital investment, marketing and other expenditures could result in lower margins or loss of market share and volumes. Moreover, most of our major markets are mature, so growth opportunities may be more limited to us than to our competitors. For example, sales in the U.S. and Canada accounted for approximately 80% of our total 2018 sales.    Our success as an enterprise depends largely on the success of relatively few products in several mature markets specific to the beer industry; if consumer preferences shift away from our products or consumption of our products decline, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.    Our Coors Light and Miller Lite brands in the U.S., Coors Light, Molson Canadian, Coors Banquet and Carling brands in Canada, and Carling, Staropramen, Jelen, Bergenbier and Coors Light brands in Europe represented approximately half of each respective segment's sales volumes in 2018. Additionally, several of our brands represent a significant share of their respective market, therefore volatility in these markets could disproportionately impact the performance of these brands. Consequently, any material shift in consumer preferences away from these brands, or from the categories in which they compete, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Consumer preferences and tastes may shift away from our brands or beer generally due to, among others, changing taste preferences, demographics, downturn in economic conditions or perceived value, as well as changes in consumers' perception of our brands due to negative publicity, regulatory actions or litigation. Recently, there has been more attention focused on health concerns and the harmful effects of alcoholic beverages which could result in a change in the social acceptability of beer and other alcoholic beverages which could materially impact the consumption of beer and our sales. Additionally, in some of our major markets, specifically Canada, the U.S. and Europe, there has been a shift in consumer preferences within the total beer market away from premium brands to ""craft beer"" produced by smaller, regional microbreweries, as well as a shift within the total alcohol beverage market from beer to wine and spirits. Moreover, several of our major markets are mature and we have a significant share in such markets, therefore, small movements in consumer preference, such as consumer shifts away from premium light brands, can disproportionately impact our results. Although the ultimate impact is currently unknown, the emergence of legal cannabis in certain U.S. states and Canada may result in a shift of discretionary income away from our products or a change in consumer preferences away from beer. As a result, a shift in consumer preferences away from our products or beer or a decline in the consumption of our products could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    The success of our business relies heavily on brand image, reputation, product quality and protection of intellectual property.    It is important that we maintain and increase the image and reputation of our existing brands and products. Concerns about product quality, even when unsubstantiated, could be harmful to our image and reputation of our brands and products. While we have quality control programs in place, in the event we experienced an issue with product quality, we may experience recalls or liability in addition to business disruption which could further negatively impact brand image and reputation and negatively affect our sales. Our brand image and reputation may also be more difficult to protect due to less oversight and control as a result of the outsourcing of some of our operations. We also could be exposed to lawsuits relating to product liability or marketing or sales practices. Deterioration to our brand equity may be difficult to combat or reverse and could have a material effect on our business and financial results. In addition, because our brands carry family names, personal activities by certain members of the Molson or Coors families that harm their public image or reputation could have an adverse effect on our brands. Further, our success is dependent on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, including trademarks, patents, domain names, trade secrets and know-how. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to protect 21Table of Contentsour intellectual property rights will be sufficient or that third parties will not infringe upon or misappropriate these rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Weak, or weakening of, economic or other negative conditions in the markets in which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Beer consumption in many of our markets is closely tied to general economic conditions and a significant portion of our portfolio consists of premium and above premium brands. Difficult macroeconomic conditions in our markets, such as decreases in per capita income and level of disposable income driven by increases to inflation, income taxes, the cost of living, unemployment levels, political or economic instability or other country-specific factors could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products. For example, a trend towards value brands in certain of our markets or deterioration of the current economic conditions could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. A significant portion of our consolidated net sales revenues are concentrated in the U.S. Therefore, unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, such as a recession or slowed economic growth, in the U.S. could negatively affect consumer demand for our product in this important market. Under difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products or by shifting away from our products to lower-priced products offered by other companies. Softer consumer demand for our products, particularly in the U.S., could reduce our profitability and could negatively affect our overall financial performance.We may not be able to realize anticipated cost and operational synergies from the Acquisition.    The success of the Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize anticipated cost and operational synergies. Our success in realizing these cost synergies, and the timing of this realization, depends on the successful integration of our business and operations with the acquired business and operations. Even if we are able to integrate the acquired businesses and operations successfully, this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the cost and operational synergies of the Acquisition that we currently expect within the anticipated time frame, or at all.    Our debt level, which increased significantly to fund the Acquisition, subjects us to financial and operating risks, and the agreements governing such debt subject us to financial and operating covenants and restrictions. Our indebtedness subjects us to financial and operating covenants, including restrictions on priority indebtedness, leverage thresholds, liens, certain types of secured debt and certain types of sale lease-back transactions and transfers of assets, which may limit our flexibility in responding to our business needs. If we are not able to maintain compliance with stated financial covenants or if we breach other covenants in any debt agreement, we could be in default under such agreement. Such a default would adversely affect our credit ratings, may allow our creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness, and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. Our significant debt level and the terms of such debt could, among other things:     •make it more difficult to satisfy our obligations under the terms of our indebtedness;    •limit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us, or at all;    •limit our flexibility to plan for and adjust to changing business and market conditions and increase our     vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;    •require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to make interest and principal payments on our     debt, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future acquisitions, working capital, business     activities, and other general corporate requirements;•limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, strategic     opportunities, including acquisitions or other investments, to fund growth or for general corporate purposes,     even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity, particularly if any ratings assigned to our debt securitiesby rating organizations were revised downward; and•adversely impact our competitive position in the industry.    In addition, certain of our current and future debt and derivative financial instruments have or, in the future, could have interest rates that are tied to reference interest rates, such as the LIBOR. The volatility and availability of such reference rates are out of our control. Accordingly, changes to or the unavailability of such rates, could result in increases to the cost of debt which would negatively affect our profitability. For example, in 2017, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority announced that after 2021 it would no longer persuade or compel panel banks to submit the rates required to calculate LIBOR, and it is unclear whether the banks currently reporting information used to set LIBOR will stop doing so after 2021. Should LIBOR no 22Table of Contentslonger be available, the rates we pay under certain derivative financial instruments could increase, which would negatively affect our profitability, and the attractiveness of borrowings under our current credit facility or future debt issuances could diminish, thereby limiting our access to capital.Failure to comply with our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain future financing at competitive rates and/or our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness.    Under the terms of each of our debt facilities, we must comply with certain restrictions. These include restrictions on priority indebtedness (certain threshold percentages of secured consolidated net tangible assets), leverage thresholds, liens, and restrictions on certain types of sale lease-back transactions and transfers of assets. Failure to comply with these restrictions or maintain our credit rating may result in issues with our current financing structure and potential future financing requirements. A deterioration in our credit rating could increase our borrowing rates or have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain future financing or refinance current debt.    Ratings agencies may downgrade our credit ratings below their current investment grade levels if we are unable to meet our deleveraging commitments. A credit ratings downgrade could increase our costs of future borrowing and harm our ability to refinance our debt in the future on acceptable terms or access the capital markets.     Default by or failure of one or more of our counterparty financial institutions could cause us to incur significant losses.    As part of our risk management activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, including, among others, forward contracts, commodity swap contracts, option contracts, with various financial institutions. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by, or failure of, counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to retrieve our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty's liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings.     Our operations face significant exposure to changes in commodity prices, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.    We use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials, some of which are purchased through supply contracts with third parties, to produce our products, including barley, malted barley, hops, corn, other various starches, water and packaging materials, including aluminum cans and bottles, glass and polyethylene terephthalate containers, as well as, cardboard and other paper products. We also use a significant amount of diesel fuel, natural gas and electricity in our operations. The supply and price of these raw materials and commodities can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including market demand, alternative sources for suppliers, global geopolitical events (especially as to their impact on crude oil prices and the resulting impact on diesel fuel prices), trade agreements among producing and consuming nations, governmental regulations, including tariffs, frosts, droughts and other weather conditions, changes in precipitation patterns, the frequency of extreme weather events, economic factors affecting growth decisions, inflation, plant diseases, theft and industry surcharges and other practices. For example, in June 2018, U.S. tariffs on aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and EU went into effect, which has created volatility in the price of aluminum in the U.S. and increased the price of aluminum used in some of our product packaging. To the extent any of the foregoing factors affect the availability or prices of ingredients or packaging or our hedging arrangements do not effectively or completely hedge changes in commodity price risks and we are not able to pass these increased costs along to customers, our business and financial results could be materially adversely impacted.Unfavorable outcomes of legal or regulatory proceedings may adversely affect our business and financial condition. We are from time to time involved in or subject to legal or regulatory proceedings related to our business. Such proceedings can be complex, costly, and highly disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and other key personnel. The assessment of the outcome of such proceedings, including our potential liability, if any, is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events that are not within our control. The outcome of litigation, arbitration, regulatory or other proceedings, including amounts ultimately received or paid upon judgment or settlement, may differ materially from management’s outlook or estimates, including any amounts accrued in the financial statements. Actual outcomes, including judgments, awards, settlements or orders, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flows.We may incur impairments of the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In connection with various business combinations, we have historically allocated material amounts of the related purchase prices to goodwill and other intangible assets that are considered to have indefinite useful lives. For example, as a result of the Acquisition, we allocated approximately $6.3 billion and $7.6 23Table of Contentsbillion to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively. These assets are tested for impairment at least annually, using estimates and assumptions affected by factors such as economic and industry conditions and changes in operating performance. Additionally, in conjunction with the brand impairment tests, we also reassess each brand's indefinite-life classification. Potential resulting charges from an impairment of goodwill or brand intangible, as well as reclassification of an indefinite-lived to a definite-lived brand intangible, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, the results of our annual impairment testing completed as of October 1, 2016, indicated that the fair value of the Molson core brand indefinite-lived intangible asset was below its carrying value. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $495.2 million recorded within special items in our consolidated statements of operations during the fourth quarter of 2016. Additionally, during this review, we also reassessed the asset’s indefinite-life classification and determined that the Molson core brands have characteristics that have evolved which now indicate a definite-life is more appropriate. These brands were therefore reclassified as definite-lived intangible assets and are being amortized over useful lives ranging from 30 to 50 years.    Our most recent impairment analysis, conducted as of October 1, 2018, the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter, indicated that the fair value of the U.S., Europe and Canada reporting units were estimated at approximately 19%, 11% and 6% in excess of their carrying values, respectively. In the current year testing, it was determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units declined from the prior year, resulting in our Europe and Canada reporting units now being considered at risk of future impairment in the event of significant unfavorable changes in the forecasted cash flows (including prolonged weakening of economic conditions, or significant unfavorable changes in tax, environmental or other regulations, including interpretations thereof), terminal growth rates, market multiples and/or weighted-average cost of capital utilized in the discounted cash flow analyses. Although the fair values of our reporting units are in excess of their carrying values, the fair values are sensitive to the aforementioned potential unfavorable changes that could have an adverse impact on future analyses. Any future impairment of the U.S., Europe or Canada reporting units or brands, or reclassification of indefinite-lived brands to definite-lived, may result in material charges that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Additionally, if the on-going integration of the MillerCoors and Miller International Business is unsuccessful due to, for example, unexpected challenges or difficulties, or adverse economic, market or industry conditions, material impairment charges may be incurred in the future. The testing of our goodwill for impairment is predicated upon our determination of our reporting units. Any change to the conclusion of our reporting units or the aggregation of components within our reporting units could result in a different outcome to our annual impairment test. See Part II-Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Critical Accounting Estimates and Part II-Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 10, ""Goodwill and Intangible Assets"" of the Notes for additional information related to the results of our annual impairment testing.Termination of one or more manufacturer/distribution agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    We manufacture and/or distribute products of other beverage companies through various joint venture, licensing, distribution, contract brewing or other similar arrangements, such as our agreement to import, market, distribute and sell Heineken in Canada and our arrangements to brew and distribute Beck's, Stella Artois, Lowenbrau and Spaten and to distribute Corona in Central Europe. Our inability to renew or the loss of one or more of these arrangements, as a result of industry consolidation or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, in 2017, our International segment was adversely impacted by the loss of the Modelo brands in Japan.    Changes in various supply chain standards or agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Our business includes various joint venture and industry agreements which standardize parts of the supply chain system. An example includes our warehousing and customer delivery systems in Canada organized under joint venture agreements with other brewers. Any negative change in these agreements or material terms within these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    We rely on a small number of suppliers to obtain the packaging materials we need to operate our business. The inability to obtain materials could unfavorably affect our ability to produce our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    We purchase certain types of packaging materials including aluminum cans and bottles, glass bottles and paperboard from a small number of suppliers. Consolidation of packaging materials suppliers has reduced local supply alternatives and increased risks of supply disruptions. The inability of any of these suppliers to meet our production requirements without sufficient time to develop an alternative source could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Additionally, if the financial condition of these suppliers deteriorates our business and financial results could be adversely impacted. Our suppliers’ financial condition is affected in large part by conditions and events that are beyond our and their control, including: competitive and general market conditions in the locations in which they operate; the availability of capital and other financing resources on reasonable terms; loss of major customers; or disruptions of bottling operations that may be caused by strikes, work stoppages, labor unrest or natural disasters. A deterioration of the financial condition or results of operations of one or more of our major suppliers could adversely affect our business and financial results.24Table of Contents    Risks associated with operating our joint ventures may materially adversely affect our business and financial results.    We have entered into several joint ventures, including our joint ventures with Ball Corporation (i.e. Rocky Mountain Metal Container), and with Owens-Brockway Glass Container Inc. (i.e. Rocky Mountain Bottle Company), for a portion of our aluminum and glass packaging supply in the U.S. We may enter into additional joint ventures in the future. Our joint venture partners may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or with the goals of the joint venture. In addition, we compete against our joint venture partners in certain of our other markets. Disagreements with our business partners may impede our ability to maximize the benefits of our partnerships. Our joint venture arrangements may require us, among other matters, to pay certain costs or to make certain capital investments or to seek our joint venture partner's consent to take certain actions. In addition, our joint venture partners may be unable or unwilling to meet their economic or other obligations under the operative documents, and we may be required to either fulfill those obligations alone to ensure the ongoing success of a joint venture or to dissolve and liquidate a joint venture.     Our operations in developing and emerging markets expose us to additional risks which could harm our business and financial results.    We expect our operations in developing and emerging markets to become more significant to our operating results as we continue to further expand internationally, including in connection with our acquisition of the Miller International Business. In certain of these markets, we have limited operating experience and may not succeed. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our operations in these markets expose us to additional risks, including: changes in local political, economic, social and labor conditions; restrictions on foreign ownership and investments; repatriation of cash earned in countries outside the U.S.; import and export requirements; increased costs to ensure compliance with complex foreign laws and regulations; currency exchange rate fluctuations; a less developed and less certain legal and regulatory environment, which among other things can create uncertainty with regard to liability issues; longer payment cycles, increased credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud; and other challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences.    In addition, as a global company, we are subject to foreign and U.S. laws and regulations designed to combat governmental corruption, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, each of which could have a materially negative effect on our reputation, brands and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, there can be no assurance that our employees, business partners or agents will not violate our policies.Changes to the regulation of the distribution systems for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results.    Many countries in which we operate regulate the distribution of alcohol products and if those regulations were changed, it could alter our business practices and have material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, in the U.S. market, there is a three-tier distribution system that governs the sale of malt beverage products. That system, consisting of required separation of manufacturers, distributors and retailers, dates back to the repeal of prohibition and is periodically subject to legal challenges. To the extent that such challenges are successful and allow changes to the three-tier system, such changes could have a material adverse effect on our U.S. segment results of operations. Further, in Canada, our products are required to be distributed through each province's respective provincial liquor board. Additionally, in certain Canadian provinces, we rely on our joint venture arrangements, such as BRI and BDL, to distribute our products via retail outlets that are mandated and regulated by provincial government regulators. BRI owns and operates commercial retail outlets, known as The Beer Store, in Ontario, and BDL facilitates the distribution of our products in the Western Canadian provinces. If provincial regulation should change, the costs to adjust our distribution methods could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Our consolidated financial statements are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, most significantly the Canadian dollar and the European operating currencies such as, Euro, British Pound, Czech Koruna, Croatian Kuna, Serbian Dinar, New Romanian Leu, Bulgarian Lev and Hungarian Forint.    We hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in different currencies, most significantly in Canada and throughout Europe. Because our financial statements are presented in USD, we must translate our assets, liabilities, income and expenses into USD. Increases and decreases in the value of the USD will affect, perhaps adversely, the value of these items in our financial statements, even if their local currency value has not changed. Additionally, we are exposed to currency transaction risks related to transactions denominated in currencies other than one of the functional currencies of our operating entities, such as the purchase of certain raw material inputs or capital expenditures, as well as sales transactions and debt issuances or other incurred obligations. Further, certain actions by the government of any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our results and financial position. To the extent that we fail to adequately manage these risks through our risk management policies intended to protect our exposure to currency movements, which may affect our operations, including if our hedging arrangements do not 25Table of Contentseffectively or completely hedge changes in foreign currency rates, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. For example, as a result of the U.K. vote in 2016 to leave the European Union, the GBP experienced a significant decline in comparison to USD and EUR and may continue to be volatile. Any significant further weakening of the GBP to the USD will have an adverse impact on our European revenues as reported in USD due to the importance of U.K. sales. Additionally, the strengthening of the USD against the Canadian dollar, European currencies and various other global currencies would adversely impact our USD reported results due to the impact on foreign currency translation.Changes in tax, environmental, trade or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing, trade and other regulations could cause volatility or have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Our business is highly regulated by national, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in various jurisdictions regarding such matters as tariffs, licensing requirements, trade and pricing practices, labeling, advertising, promotion and marketing practices, relationships with distributors, environmental matters, ingredient regulations, and other matters. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent re-evaluation, varying interpretations and political debate and inquiries from government regulators charged with their enforcement, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, on December 22, 2017, H.R. 1, also known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”), was enacted in the U.S. This enactment resulted in a number of significant changes to U.S. federal income tax law for U.S. corporations. Most notably, the statutory federal corporate income tax rate was changed from 35% to 21% for corporations and, as a result, we recorded an estimated net tax benefit of approximately $567 million in our consolidated statements of operations during the fourth quarter of 2017 driven by the effects of the 2017 Tax Act on our deferred tax positions as of December 31, 2017. We continue to monitor the 2017 Tax Act, including proposed regulations which may change upon finalization, as well as yet to be issued regulations and interpretations. If the forthcoming regulations and interpretations change relative to our current understanding and initial assessment of the impacts of the 2017 Tax Act, the resulting impacts could have a material adverse impact on our tax rate and cash tax expectations. Separately, in December 2018, the U.S. Department of Treasury issued a regulation that impacts our ability to claim a refund of certain federal duties, taxes, and fees paid for beer sold between the U.S. and certain other countries effective in February 2019, and, as a result, future claims will no longer be accepted, and further, we may be unable to collect approximately $38 million in historically claimed, but not yet received, refunds, which would negatively impact our revenue. Additionally, modifications of U.S. laws and policies governing foreign trade and investment (including trade agreements and tariffs, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement or aluminum tariffs) could adversely affect our supply chain, business and results of operations. For example, in June, U.S. 2018 tariffs on aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and EU went into effect, which has created volatility in the price of aluminum in the U.S. and increased the price of aluminum used in some of our product packaging. Continued imposition of U.S. aluminum tariffs, the implementation of additional tariffs and retaliatory tariffs from trade partners or related uncertainties could further increase the cost of certain of our imported materials, thereby adversely affecting our profitability. Failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or changes in these laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof, or in tax, environmental, excise tax levels imposed or any other laws or regulations could result in the loss, revocation or suspension of our licenses, permits or approvals and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of, and potential future developments in, complex domestic and international tax laws and regulations, the amount and timing of future taxable income and the interaction of such laws and regulations among jurisdictions. Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded.     Climate change, weather and water availability may negatively affect our business and financial results.    There is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures could cause significant changes in global weather patterns and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Changing weather patterns and more volatile weather conditions could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions which may impact quality, limit availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities, such as hops, barley and other cereal grains, which are important ingredients for our products. Furthermore, should weather patterns in our markets shift from warm or high temperatures to unseasonably cool or wet weather, consumption of our products may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain, distribution networks and routes to market, or impact demand for our products. In addition, public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. Clean water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and climate change may increase water scarcity and cause a deterioration of water quality in areas where we maintain brewing operations. The competition for water among domestic, agricultural and manufacturing users is increasing in some of our brewing communities. Even where water is widely available, water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain our operations. 26Table of ContentsConcern over climate change may result in new or increased regional, federal and global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases, or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns. In the event that such regulation is more stringent than current regulatory obligations or the measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor and improve our energy efficiency and water conservation, we may experience disruptions in, or increases in our costs of, operation and delivery and we may be required to make additional investments in facilities and equipment or relocate our facilities. In particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could increase the cost of energy, including fuel, required to operate our facilities or transport and distribute our products, thereby increasing the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. As a result, the effects of climate change or water scarcity could negatively affect our business and operations. In addition, any failure to achieve our goals with respect to reducing our impact on the environment or perception (whether or not valid) of our failure to act responsibly with respect to water use and the environment or to effectively respond to new, or changes in, legal or regulatory requirements concerning climate change or water scarcity could result in adverse publicity and could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. There is also increased focus, including by governmental and non-governmental organizations, investors, customers and consumers on these and other environmental sustainability matters, including deforestation, land use, climate impact and water use. Our reputation could be damaged if we or others in our industry do not act, or are perceived not to act, responsibly with respect to our impact on the environment.Loss or closure of a major brewery or other key facility, due to unforeseen or catastrophic events or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Our business could be interrupted and our financial results could be materially adversely impacted by physical risks such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, terror attacks and other natural disasters or catastrophic events that damage or destroy one of our breweries or key facilities or the key facilities of our significant suppliers. Additionally, certain catastrophes are not covered by our general insurance policies, which could result in significant unrecoverable losses. Furthermore, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted by under-investment in physical assets or production capacity, including contract brewing and effect on priority of our brands if production capacity is limited. Further, significant excess capacity at any of our breweries as a result of increased efficiencies in our supply chain process or continued volume declines, could result in under-utilization of our assets, which could lead to excess overhead expenses or additional costs incurred associated with the closure of one or more of our facilities. For example, as part of a strategic review of our supply chain network, certain breweries and bottling lines were closed in recent years, and we have and continue to incur brewery closure costs. We regularly review our supply chain network to ensure that our supply chain capacity is aligned with the needs of the business. Such reviews could potentially result in further closures and the related costs could be material.    Failure to successfully identify, complete or integrate attractive acquisitions and joint ventures into our existing operations could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.    We have made a number of acquisitions and entered into several strategic joint ventures. In order to compete in the consolidating global brewing industry, we anticipate that we may, from time to time, in the future acquire additional businesses or enter into additional joint ventures that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our business such as the Acquisition and our Canadian business' joint venture with HEXO. Potential risks associated with acquisitions and joint ventures could include, among other things: our ability to identify attractive acquisitions and joint ventures; our ability to offer potential acquisition targets and joint venture partners' competitive transaction terms; our ability to raise capital on reasonable terms to finance attractive acquisitions and joint ventures; our ability to realize the benefits or cost savings that we expect to realize as a result of the acquisition or joint venture; diversion of management's attention; our ability to successfully integrate our businesses with the business of the acquired company; motivating, recruiting and retaining key employees; conforming standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures among our company and the acquired company; consolidating and streamlining sales, marketing and corporate operations; potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies; potential exposure to unknown or future liabilities or costs that affect the markets in which acquired companies or joint ventures operate; reputational or other damage due to the conduct of a joint venture partner; loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business; and managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations following completion of an acquisition or entry into a joint venture. Poor investment performance of pension plan holdings and other factors impacting pension plan costs could unfavorably affect our business, liquidity and our financial results.    Our costs of providing defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on the plans' assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, exchange rate fluctuations, government regulation, court rulings or other changes in legal requirements, global equity prices, and our required and/or voluntary contributions to the plans. While we comply with the minimum funding requirements, we have certain qualified pension plans with obligations which exceed the value of the plans' assets. These funding requirements also may require contributions even when there is no reported deficit. Without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans' assets, and depending upon the other factors as listed above, we could be required to fund the plans with significant amounts of cash. Such 27Table of Contentscash funding obligations (or the timing of such contributions) could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, credit rating, cost of borrowing, financial position and/or results of operations. For example, following the completion of the triennial review of the U.K. pension plan with the plan's trustees in 2014, we made a GBP 150 million contribution to our U.K. pension plan in January 2015, based on the underfunded status of the plan and the evaluation of the plan's performance and long-term obligations. In addition, we made pension plan contributions during 2017 of approximately $310 million, including $200 million of discretionary contributions to the U.S. pension plan.    We depend on key personnel, the loss of whom could harm our business.    The loss of the services and expertise of any key employee could harm our business. Our future success depends on our ability to identify, attract and retain qualified personnel on a timely basis. Turnover of senior management can adversely impact our stock price, our results of operations and our client relationships and may make recruiting for future management positions more difficult. In addition, we must successfully integrate any new management personnel that we hire within our organization, or who join our organization as a result of an acquisition, in order to achieve our operating objectives, and changes in other key management positions may temporarily affect our financial performance and results of operations as new management becomes familiar with our business.Due to a high concentration of workers represented by unions or trade councils in Canada, Europe, and the U.S., we could be significantly affected by labor strikes, work stoppages or other employee-related issues.    As of December 31, 2018, approximately 50%, 35%, and 30% of our Canadian, European and U.S. workforces, respectively, are represented by trade unions or councils. Stringent labor laws in certain of our key markets expose us to a greater risk of loss should we experience labor disruptions in those markets. A prolonged labor strike, work stoppage or other employee-related issue, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, in the first quarter of 2017, our Toronto brewery unionized employees commenced a labor strike initiated from on-going negotiations of the collective bargaining agreement. This labor strike resulted in slower than expected production at the Toronto brewery in the first quarter of 2017.  From time to time, our collective bargaining agreements come due for renegotiation, and, if we are unable to timely complete negotiations, affected employees may strike, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.Because of our reliance on third-party service providers and internal and outsourced systems for our information technology and certain other administrative functions, we could experience a disruption to our business.    We rely extensively on information services providers worldwide for our information technology functions including network, help desk, hardware and software configuration. Additionally, we rely on internal networks and information systems and other technology, including the internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement and supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments. We use information systems for certain human resource activities and to process our employee benefits, as well as to process financial information for internal and external reporting purposes and to comply with various reporting, legal and tax requirements. As information systems are critical to many of our operating activities, our business may be impacted by system shutdowns, service disruptions, obsolescence, or security breaches. Additionally, if one of our service providers were to fail and we were unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner, we could be unable to properly administer our outsourced functions. A breach of our information systems could cause material financial or reputational harm. Our internal and outsourced systems may also be the target of cyber-attacks or other breaches to our security, which, if successful, could expose us to the loss of key business, employee, customer or vendor information and disruption of our operations. If our information systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results and we may lose revenue and profits as a result of our inability to timely prepare, distribute, invoice and collect payments from our customers. Misuse, leakage or falsification of information could result in a violation of data privacy laws and regulations, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, or damage our reputation and credibility. In addition, we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information and may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight or consumers may avoid our brands due to negative publicity. We could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.If the Pentland Trust and the Coors Trust do not agree on a matter submitted to our stockholders or if a super-majority of our board of directors do not agree on certain actions, generally the matter will not be approved, even if beneficial to us or favored by other stockholders or a majority of our board of directors.    Pentland Securities (1981) Inc. (the ""Pentland Trust"") (a company controlled by the Molson family and related parties) and the Adolph Coors, Jr. Trust (the ""Coors Trust""), which together control more than 90% of our Class A common stock and Class A exchangeable shares, have a voting trust agreement through which they have combined their voting power over the shares of our Class A common stock and the Class A exchangeable shares that they own. If these two stockholders do not agree to vote in favor of a matter submitted to a stockholder vote (other than the election of directors), the voting trustees are required to vote all of the Class A common stock 28Table of Contentsand Class A exchangeable shares deposited in the voting trust against the matter. There is no other mechanism in the voting trust agreement to resolve a potential deadlock between these stockholders. Therefore, if either the Pentland Trust or the Coors Trust is unwilling to vote in favor of a proposal that is subject to a stockholder vote, we would be unable to implement the proposal even if our board of directors, management or other stockholders believe the proposal is beneficial to us. Similarly, our bylaws require the authorization of a super-majority (two-thirds) of the board of directors to take certain transformational actions. Thus, it is possible that the Company will not be authorized to take action even if it is supported by a simple majority of the board of directors.    The interests of the controlling stockholders may differ from those of other stockholders and could prevent the Company from making certain decisions or taking certain actions that would be in the best interest of the other stockholders.    Our Class B common stock has fewer voting rights than our Class A common stock and holders of our Class A common stock have the ability to effectively control or have a significant influence over certain company actions requiring stockholder approval, which could have a material adverse effect on Class B stockholders. See Part II-Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 8, ""Stockholders' Equity"" of the Notes for additional information regarding voting rights of Class A and Class B stockholders.    Changes in the social acceptability of alcohol, perceptions of our products and the political view of the alcohol beverage industry may harm our business.    The alcoholic beverage industry is regularly the subject of anti-alcohol activist activity related to the health concerns from the misuse of alcohol and concerns regarding underage drinking and exposure to alcohol advertisements. In addition, in recent years, there has been an increase in public and political attention on health and well-being as it relates to the alcohol beverage and other industries. Negative publicity regarding beer and changes in consumer perceptions in relation to beer and other alcoholic beverages, could adversely affect the sale and consumption of our products which could, in turn, adversely affect our business and financial conditions. Additionally, the concerns around alcohol as well as health and well-being could result in unfavorable regulations or other legal requirements in certain of our markets, such as advertising, selling and other restrictions, increased taxes associated with our sales, or the establishment of minimum unit pricing. Any such regulations or requirements could change consumer and customer purchasing patterns, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. In particular, advocates of prohibition and other severe restrictions on the marketing and sales of alcohol are becoming increasingly organized and coordinated on a global basis, seeking to impose laws or regulations or to bring actions against us, to curtail substantially the consumption of alcohol, including beer, in developed and developing markets. To the extent such views gain traction in regulations of jurisdictions in which we do or plan to do business, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, in early 2016, the government of Bihar, India, the largest state in India in which our International segment operates, announced a complete prohibition on the sale and distribution of alcohol, which resulted in the impairment of assets totaling $30.8 million, recorded during the second quarter of 2016.The Acquisition subjects us to significant additional liabilities, costs and other risks.    We have assumed all of the liabilities of MillerCoors, including, among others, significant pension and other post-employment benefit liabilities. The assumed liabilities put additional pressure on our ability to successfully meet our deleveraging commitments and grow our business over time as discussed further below. In addition, as a result of the Acquisition, we are subject to the risks of the U.S. beer market to a much greater extent, and a significant majority of our overall business is in mature, low growth beer markets, such as the U.S., Canada and the U.K. Economic conditions and consumer preferences in these markets will have a greater impact on our results of operations and financial condition.We face numerous risks associated with the integration of the Miller International Business.    The acquisition of the Miller International Business may subject us to unknown expenses and liabilities. The success of our acquisition of the Miller International Business will depend, in part, on our ability to realize all or some of the anticipated synergies and other benefits from integrating this business with our existing businesses and operations. The potential difficulties of the continuing integration of operations include, among others:•failure to implement our business plan for the combined business; •unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations; •inherent operating risks in the business; •increased foreign currency exposures which could adversely affect the amounts recorded for our foreign assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and could have a negative effect on our results of operations;•reliance on competitors, ABI, to provide production services as we continue to transition the business; and29Table of Contents•failure to develop sustainable production sources prior to the expiration of ABI's production services.We may not be able to maintain the levels of revenue, earnings or operating efficiency that each of the Company and the Miller International Business had achieved or might achieve separately. The markets in which the Miller International Business operates may not experience the growth rates expected and any economic downturn affecting those markets could negatively impact the Miller International Business. These markets are in differing stages of development and may experience more volatility than expected or face more operating risks than in the more mature markets in which we have historically operated. If the Miller International Business or the markets in which it operates deteriorate, the potential cost savings, growth opportunities and other synergies of the acquisition of the Miller International Business may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. In such case, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively impacted.We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which, if not remediated, could adversely affect our business, reputation and stock price.    As part of preparing our 2018 consolidated financial statements, we identified errors in the accounting for income taxes related to the deferred tax liabilities for our partnership in MillerCoors. See Part II-Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1, ""Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" for further discussion. As a result of these errors, management identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, related to designing and maintaining effective controls over the completeness and accuracy of the accounting for, and disclosure of, the income tax effects of acquired partnership interests. Specifically, we did not design appropriate controls to identify and reconcile deferred income taxes associated with the accounting for acquired partnership interests. This material weakness resulted in material errors in connection with our step acquisition of MillerCoors that were corrected through the restatement of the consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, as described in Part II-Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1, ""Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" to the consolidated financial statements and the correction of the unaudited quarterly financial information for fiscal years 2018 and 2017. Additionally, this material weakness could result in misstatements to the aforementioned account balances or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. As a result of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting, management has concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission in “Internal Control-An Integrated Framework (2013).” We cannot assure you that we will not identify additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future related to income tax or other controls. If the steps we take do not correct the material weakness in a timely manner, we may be unable to conclude in the future that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. The occurrence of or failure to remediate this or future material weaknesses may adversely affect our reputation and business and the market price of our common stock.Risks Specific to the United States SegmentOur U.S. business is highly dependent on independent distributors to sell our products, with no assurance that these distributors will effectively sell our products.    We sell nearly all of our products, including all of our imported products, in the U.S. to independent distributors for resale to retail outlets. These independent distributors are entitled to exclusive territories and protected from termination by state statutes and regulations. Consequently, if we are not allowed, or are unable under acceptable terms or at all, to replace unproductive or inefficient distributors, our business, financial position and results of operation may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Risks Specific to the Canada SegmentOur Canadian business faces numerous risks relating to its joint venture in the Canadian cannabis industry.    On October 4, 2018, a wholly-owned subsidiary within our Canadian business completed the formation of an independent Canadian joint venture with HEXO, a Canadian entity listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange that serves the Canadian cannabis market. The joint venture, Truss LP, will pursue opportunities to develop non-alcoholic, cannabis-infused beverages for the Canadian market following legalization. The success and consumer acceptance of any products produced by the joint venture cannot be assured. Further, our Canadian subsidiary’s involvement in the Canadian cannabis industry may negatively impact: consumer, business partner, investor or public sentiment regarding our brands, Canadian beer business or our company. The emerging cannabis industry in Canada and in other jurisdictions is evolving rapidly and subjects us to a high degree of political, legal and regulatory uncertainty, including when and if regulations in Canada will ultimately be adopted that would allow the 30Table of Contentssale of the non-alcoholic beverages contemplated by the joint venture. The occurrence of any of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may experience adverse effects on our Canada business and financial results due to declines in the overall Canadian beer industry, continued price discounting, increased cost of goods sold and higher taxes.    If the Canadian beer market continues to decline, the impact to our financial results could be exacerbated due to our significant share of the overall market. Additionally, continuation or acceleration of price discounting, in Ontario, Québec, Alberta or other provinces, as well as increases in our cost of goods sold, could adversely impact our business. Further, changes in the Canadian tax legislation, such as the potential for an increase in beer excise taxes, could decrease our net sales. Although the ultimate impact is currently unknown, the legalization of cannabis in Canada may result in a shift of discretionary income away from our products or a change in consumer preferences away from beer or our other products. Moreover, the future success and earnings growth of the Canada business depends, in part, on our ability to efficiently conduct our operations. Failure to generate significant cost savings and margin improvement through our ongoing initiatives could adversely affect our profitability.    If we are required to move away from the industry standard returnable bottle we use today, we may incur unexpected losses.    Along with other brewers in Canada, we currently use an industry standard returnable bottle which represents approximately 29% of total volume sales (excluding imports) in Canada. Changes to the Industry Standard Bottle Agreement could impact our use of the industry standard returnable bottle. If we cease to use the industry standard returnable bottle, our current bottle inventory and a portion of our bottle packaging equipment could become obsolete and could result in a material write-off of these assets.             Indemnities provided to the purchaser of 83% of the Cervejarias Kaiser Brasil S.A. (""Kaiser"") business in Brazil could result in future cash outflows and statement of operations charges.    In 2006, we sold our 83% ownership interest in Kaiser, which was held by our Canadian business, to FEMSA Cerveza S.A. de C.V. (""FEMSA""). The terms of the sale agreement require us to indemnify FEMSA for exposures related to certain tax, civil and labor contingencies and certain purchased tax credits. The ultimate resolution of these claims is not under our control. These indemnity obligations are recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, however, we could incur future statement of operations charges as facts further develop resulting in changes to our estimates or changes in our assessment of probability of loss on these items as well as due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Due to the uncertainty involved in the ultimate outcome and timing of these contingencies, significant adjustments to the carrying value of our indemnity liabilities and corresponding statement of operations charges/credits could result in the future. We historically presented the liabilities associated with these indemnity obligations within discontinued operations, however, these have been reclassified into other current and long-term liabilities.Risks Specific to the Europe SegmentThe vote in the U.K. to leave the European Union could adversely affect us.  Approximately 11% of our consolidated net sales in 2018 came from the U.K., which is our largest market in Europe. In 2016, a majority of voters in the U.K. voted in favor of the U.K. leaving the European Union and the U.K. intends to withdraw from the European Union in March 2019. The withdrawal remains controversial in the U.K., and the terms of the withdrawal remain unknown. The U.K. vote to leave the European Union triggered a decline in the GBP in comparison to USD and EUR. Any significant weakening of the GBP to the USD will have an adverse impact on our European revenues as reported in USD due to the importance of U.K. sales. Furthermore, the withdrawal may result in disruption to and decline of the U.K. and European economies. Weakening of economic conditions or economic uncertainties tend to harm the beer business, and if such conditions emerge in the U.K. or in the rest of Europe, it may have a material adverse effect on our Europe segment. The withdrawal may also result in significant disruption in trade and the movement of goods, including prolonged transportation delays, which could negatively affect our ability to source raw materials and packaging for our products as well as our ability to import and export products. Because the terms of the exit are still unknown, we face regulatory and market uncertainty and may need to quickly adapt to regulatory changes and market volatility, including potential increased legal and regulatory complexities and potential higher costs of conducting business in the U.K. or Europe. Any of these effects, among others, could adversely affect our European business, results of operations, and financial condition.     Economic trends and intense competition in European markets could unfavorably affect our profitability.    Our European businesses have been, and, in the future may be, adversely affected by conditions in the global financial markets and general economic and political conditions, as well as a weakening of their respective currencies versus the U.S. dollar. Additionally, we face intense competition in certain of our European markets, particularly with respect to pricing, which could lead to reduced sales or profitability. In particular, the on-going focus by large competitors in Europe to drive increased market share through aggressive pricing strategies could adversely affect our sales and results of operations. In addition, in recent years, beer volume sales in Europe have been shifting from pubs and restaurants (on-premise) to retail stores (off-premise) for the industry in general. Sales to off-premise customers tend to be lower than margins on sales to on-premise customers, and, as a result, continuation or acceleration of this trend would further adversely affect our profitability.31Table of ContentsRisks Specific to the International SegmentAn inability to expand our operations in emerging markets could adversely affect our growth prospects.    The continued expansion of our International segment in emerging markets depends on our ability to react to social, economic, and political conditions in those markets; to create effective product distribution networks and consumer brand awareness in new markets; and, in many cases, to find appropriate local partners. Due to product price, local regulatory changes, local competition from competitors that are larger and have more resources than we do, and cultural differences, or absence of effective routes to market, there is no assurance that our products will be accepted in any particular emerging market. If we are unable to expand our businesses in emerging markets, our growth prospects could be adversely affected"
9,TAP,MOLSON COORS BREWING CO,2018-02-14,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORSInvesting in our Company involves risk. The reader should carefully consider the following risk factors and the other information contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks set forth below are those that management believes are most likely to have a material adverse effect on us, however, are not a comprehensive description of the risks facing our Company. We may also be subject to other risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial but may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods. If the following risks or uncertainties, individually or in combination, actually occur, they may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects.Risks Specific to Our CompanyThe global beer industry is constantly evolving, and our position within the global beer industry and our markets in which we operate may fundamentally change. If we do not successfully transform along with the evolving industry and market dynamics, then the result could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    The brewing industry has significantly evolved over the years becoming an increasingly global beer market. For many years, the industry operated primarily on local presence with modest international expansion achieved through export, license and partnership arrangements, whereas it has now become increasingly complex as the global consolidation of brewers has resulted in fewer major market participants. At the same time, smaller local brewers within certain geographies are seeing accelerated growth as consumers increasingly place value on locally-produced and/or regionally-sourced products. As a result of the increased global consolidation of brewers and the dynamic of an expanding new segment within the industry with new market entrants, the markets in which we operate, particularly the more mature markets, may evolve at a disadvantage to our current market position and local governments may intervene, which may fundamentally accelerate transformational changes to such markets. For example, U.S. and Canada beer markets have long consisted of a select number of significant market participants with government-regulated routes to market. However, evolution in these and others of our beer markets together with emerging changes to consumer preferences have introduced a significant expansion of market entrants and resulted in increased consumer choice and market competition, as well as increased government scrutiny. Specifically, in the U.S., Canada and Europe, we have experienced vast expansion in the craft beer industry along with the expansion of cider and flavored malt beverages and, accordingly, among other things, we have strategically acquired several craft breweries. If our competitors are able to respond more quickly to the evolving trends within the craft beer, cider and flavored malt beverages categories, or if our new products are not successful, our business and financial results may be adversely impacted. In Canada, changes to interprovincial trade rules, regulations, distribution models, and packaging requirements, such as government-owned retail outlets and industry standard returnable bottles, may be disadvantageous to us. Currently, in Ontario and other provinces, provincial governments are reviewing and/or changing this historical foundation as a result of this market evolution and increased demand by some for government intervention to enhance competition and choice. In addition, the Supreme Court of Canada is currently considering the validity of certain interprovincial trade rules, which, among other things, may favor local or small brewers, and any changes could adversely impact our operating model across Canada. If we are unsuccessful in evolving with, and navigating through, the changes to the markets in which we operate, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. See risk factors below under “Risks Specific to the Canadian Segment” for additional risks specific to competition in the Canadian beer market.    Competition in our markets could require us to reduce prices or increase capital and other expenditures or cause us to lose sales volume, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    In many of our markets, our primary competitors have greater financial, marketing, production and distribution resources than we do, and may be more diverse in terms of their geographies and brand portfolios. In all of the markets in which we operate, aggressive marketing strategies, such as reduced pricing, brand positioning, and increased capital investments by these competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, continuing consolidation among major global brewers may lead to stronger or new competitors, loss of partner brands, negative impacts on our distributor networks and pressures from marketing and pricing tactics by competitors.  Further, consolidation of distributors in our industry could reduce our ability to promote our brands in the market in a manner that enhances rather than diminishes their value, as well as reduce our ability to manage our pricing effectively.  Additionally, due to competition with brewers and other beverage companies, an increase in the purchasing power of our large competitors may cause further pricing pressures which could prevent us from increasing prices to recover higher costs necessary to compete. Such pressures could have a material adverse impact our on our business and our financial results and market share. Failure to generate significant cost savings and margin improvement through our ongoing initiatives could adversely affect our profitability.  Increased pressures for reduced pricing or difficulties in increasing prices while remaining competitive within our markets, as well as the need for increased capital investment, marketing and other expenditures could result in lower margins or loss of market share and volumes. Moreover, most of our major markets are mature, so growth opportunities may be more limited to us than to our competitors. For example, sales in the U.S. and Canada accounted for approximately 80% of our total 2017 sales.    21Table of ContentsOur success as an enterprise depends largely on the success of relatively few products in several mature markets specific to the beer industry; if consumer preferences shift away from our products or consumption of our products decline, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.    Our Coors Light and Miller Lite brands in the U.S., Coors Light, Molson Canadian, Coors Banquet and Carling brands in Canada, and Carling, Staropramen, Jelen, Bergenbier and Coors Light brands in Europe represented approximately half of each respective segment's sales volumes in 2017. Additionally, several of our brands represent a significant share of their respective market, therefore volatility in these markets could disproportionately impact the performance of these brands. Consequently, any material shift in consumer preferences away from these brands, or from the categories in which they compete, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Consumer preferences and tastes may shift away from our brands or beer generally due to, among others, changing taste preferences, demographics, downturn in economic conditions or perceived value, as well as changes in consumers' perception of our brands due to negative publicity, regulatory actions or litigation. Recently, there has been more attention focused on health concerns and the harmful effects of alcoholic beverages which could result in a change in the social acceptability of beer and other alcoholic beverages which could materially impact the consumption of beer and our sales. Additionally, in some of our major markets, specifically Canada, the U.S. and Europe, there has been a shift in consumer preferences within the total beer market away from premium brands to ""craft beer"" produced by smaller, regional microbreweries, as well as a shift within the total alcohol beverage market from beer to wine and spirits. Moreover, several of our major markets are mature and we have a significant share in such markets, therefore, small movements in consumer preference, such as a consumer shift away from premium light brands, can disproportionately impact our results. Although the ultimate impact is currently unknown, the emergence of legal cannabis in certain U.S. states and Canada may result in a shift of discretionary income away from our products or a change in consumer preferences away from beer.  As a result, a shift in consumer preferences away from our products or beer or a decline in the consumption of our products could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    The success of our business relies heavily on brand image, reputation, product quality and protection of intellectual property.    It is important that we maintain and increase the image and reputation of our existing brands and products. Concerns about product quality, even when unsubstantiated, could be harmful to our image and reputation of our brands and products. While we have quality control programs in place, in the event we experienced an issue with product quality, we may experience recalls or liability in addition to business disruption which could further negatively impact brand image and reputation and negatively affect our sales. Our brand image and reputation may also be more difficult to protect due to less oversight and control as a result of the outsourcing of some of our operations. We also could be exposed to lawsuits relating to product liability or marketing or sales practices.  Deterioration to our brand equity may be difficult to combat or reverse and could have a material effect on our business and financial results. In addition, because our brands carry family names, personal activities by certain members of the Molson or Coors families that harm their public image or reputation could have an adverse effect on our brands. Further, our success is dependent on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, including trademarks, patents, domain names, trade secrets and know-how. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be sufficient or that third parties will not infringe upon or misappropriate these rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Weak, or weakening of, economic or other negative conditions in the markets in which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Beer consumption in many of our markets is closely tied to general economic conditions and a significant portion of our portfolio consists of premium and above premium brands. Difficult macroeconomic conditions in our markets, such as decreases in per capita income and level of disposable income driven by increases to inflation, income taxes, the cost of living, unemployment levels, political or economic instability or other country-specific factors could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products. For example, a trend towards value brands in certain of our markets or further deterioration of the current economic conditions could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. A significant portion of our consolidated net sales revenues are concentrated in the U.S. Therefore, unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, such as a recession or slowed economic growth, in the U.S. could negatively affect consumer demand for our product in this important market. Under difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products or by shifting away from our products to lower-priced products offered by other companies. Softer consumer demand for our products in the U.S. could reduce our profitability and could negatively affect our overall financial performance.We may not be able to realize anticipated cost and operational synergies from the Acquisition.    The success of the Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize anticipated cost and operational synergies. Our success in realizing these cost synergies, and the timing of this realization, depends on the successful integration of our business and operations with the acquired business and operations. Even if we are able to integrate the acquired businesses and operations successfully, 22Table of Contentsthis integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the cost and operational synergies of the Acquisition that we currently expect within the anticipated time frame, or at all.The Acquisition subjects us to significant additional liabilities, costs and other risks.    We have assumed all of the liabilities of MillerCoors, including, among others, significant pension and other post-employment benefit liabilities. The assumed liabilities put additional pressure on our ability to successfully meet our deleveraging commitments and grow our business over time as discussed further below. In addition, as a result of the Acquisition, we are subject to the risks of the U.S. beer market to a much greater extent, and a significant majority of our overall business is in mature, low growth beer markets, such as the U.S., Canada and the U.K. Economic conditions and consumer preferences in these markets will have a greater impact on our results of operations and financial condition.We may also incur additional costs in the course of the integration of the Miller International Business, and we cannot be certain that the elimination of duplicative costs or the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will offset the transaction and integration costs in the near term, or at all. Integrations of acquired businesses are complex, costly, and time-consuming, and such activities divert management’s time and attention. The assumption of liabilities in the Acquisition, coupled with any delays, additional costs, or issues experienced during the integration period could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We face numerous risks associated with the integration of the Miller International Business.    The acquisition of the Miller International Business may subject us to unknown expenses and liabilities. These risks arise because we acquired the Miller International Business from ABI at a time when we had no access to historical financial statements or information which were then in the possession of SABMiller. Accordingly, our due diligence was limited. Under a settlement agreement entered into with ABI in January 2018, we received an Adjustment Amount of $328 million related to the Acquisition; however, this adjustment may not be sufficient to mitigate all our risks related to the limited due diligence and incomplete historical financial statements and information of the Miller International Business. The success of our acquisition of the Miller International Business will depend, in part, on our ability to realize all or some of the anticipated synergies and other benefits from integrating this business with our existing businesses and operations. The potential difficulties of the continuing integration of operations include, among others:•failure to implement our business plan for the combined business; •impacts of change in control provisions in contracts and agreements;•failure to retain key customers, employees and suppliers; •unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations; •inherent operating risks in the business; •unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities; •increased foreign currency exposures which could adversely affect the amounts recorded for our foreign assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and could have a negative effect on our results of operations;•unfamiliarity with operating in many of the countries in which the Miller International Business operates;•reliance on competitors, ABI (or Asahi, in the case of Europe), to provide production services as we continue to transition the business;•failure to develop sustainable production sources prior to the expiration of ABI's (or Asahi's, in the case of Europe) production services.We may not be able to maintain the levels of revenue, earnings or operating efficiency that each of the Company and the Miller International Business had achieved or might achieve separately. The markets in which the Miller International Business operates may not experience the growth rates expected and any economic downturn affecting those markets could negatively impact the Miller International Business. These markets are in differing stages of development and may experience more volatility than expected or face more operating risks than in the more mature markets in which we have historically operated. If the Miller International Business or the markets in which it operates deteriorate, the potential cost savings, growth opportunities and other synergies of the acquisition of the Miller International Business may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer 23Table of Contentsto realize than expected. In such case, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively impacted.Our debt level, which increased significantly to fund the Acquisition, subjects us to financial and operating risks, and the agreements governing such debt subject us to financial and operating covenants and restrictions. Our indebtedness subjects us to financial and operating covenants, including restrictions on priority indebtedness, leverage thresholds, liens, certain types of secured debt and certain types of sale lease-back transactions and transfers of assets, which may limit our flexibility in responding to our business needs. If we are not able to maintain compliance with stated financial covenants or if we breach other covenants in any debt agreement, we could be in default under such agreement. Such a default would adversely affect our credit ratings, may allow our creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness, and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. Our significant debt level and the terms of such debt could, among other things:     •make it more difficult to satisfy our obligations under the terms of our indebtedness;    •limit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us, or at all;    •limit our flexibility to plan for and adjust to changing business and market conditions and increase our     vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;    •require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to make interest and principal payments on our     debt, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future acquisitions, working capital, business     activities, and other general corporate requirements;•limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, strategic     opportunities, including acquisitions or other investments, to fund growth or for general corporate purposes,     even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity, particularly if any ratings assigned to our debt securitiesby rating organizations were revised downward; and•adversely impact our competitive position in the industry.Failure to comply with our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain future financing at competitive rates and/or our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness.    Under the terms of each of our debt facilities, we must comply with certain restrictions. These include restrictions on priority indebtedness (certain threshold percentages of secured consolidated net tangible assets), leverage thresholds, liens, and restrictions on certain types of sale lease-back transactions and transfers of assets. Failure to comply with these restrictions or maintain our credit rating may result in issues with our current financing structure and potential future financing requirements. A deterioration in our credit rating could increase our borrowing rates or have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain future financing or refinance current debt.    Ratings agencies may downgrade our credit ratings below their current investment grade levels if we are unable to meet our deleveraging commitments. A credit ratings downgrade could increase our costs of future borrowing and harm our ability to refinance our debt in the future on acceptable terms or access the capital markets. We currently intend to hold per share dividends constant and have suspended both our dividend target of 18% to 22% of trailing annualized EBITDA and our share repurchase program. We also intend to use cash from operations to reduce our debt level, which will reduce funds available for other operational or strategic needs and may increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions.     Default by or failure of one or more of our counterparty financial institutions could cause us to incur significant losses.    As part of our risk management activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, including, among others, forward contracts, commodity swap contracts, option contracts, with various financial institutions. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by, or failure of, counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to retrieve our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty's liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings.     24Table of ContentsOur operations face significant exposure to changes in commodity prices, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.    We use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials, some of which are purchased through supply contracts with third parties, to produce our products, including barley, malted barley, hops, corn, other various starches, water and packaging materials, including aluminum cans and bottles, glass and polyethylene terephthalate containers, as well as, cardboard and other paper products. We also use a significant amount of diesel fuel, natural gas and electricity in our operations. The supply and price of these raw materials and commodities can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including market demand, alternative sources for suppliers, global geopolitical events (especially as to their impact on crude oil prices and the resulting impact on diesel fuel prices), trade agreements among producing and consuming nations, governmental regulations, including tariffs, frosts, droughts and other weather conditions, economic factors affecting growth decisions, inflation, plant diseases and theft. To the extent any of the foregoing factors affect the availability or prices of ingredients or packaging or our hedging arrangements do not effectively or completely hedge changes in commodity price risks and we are not able to pass these increased costs along to customers, our business and financial results could be materially adversely impacted.Unfavorable outcomes of legal or regulatory proceedings may adversely affect our business and financial condition. We are from time to time involved in or subject to legal or regulatory proceedings related to our business. Such proceedings can be complex, costly, and highly disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and other key personnel. The assessment of the outcome of such proceedings, including our potential liability, if any, is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events that are not within our control. The outcome of litigation, arbitration, regulatory or other proceedings, including amounts ultimately received or paid upon judgment or settlement, may differ materially from management’s outlook or estimates, including any amounts accrued in the financial statements. Actual outcomes, including judgments, awards, settlements or orders, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flows.We may incur impairments of the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In connection with various business combinations, we have historically allocated material amounts of the related purchase prices to goodwill and other intangible assets that are considered to have indefinite useful lives. For example, as a result of the Acquisition, we have allocated approximately $6.3 billion and $7.6 billion to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively. These assets are tested for impairment at least annually, using estimates and assumptions affected by factors such as economic and industry conditions and changes in operating performance. Additionally, in conjunction with the brand impairment tests, we also reassess each brand's indefinite-life classification. Potential resulting charges from an impairment of goodwill or brand intangible, as well as reclassification of an indefinite-lived to a definite-lived brand intangible, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, the results of our annual impairment testing completed as of October 1, 2016, indicated that the fair value of the Molson core brand indefinite-lived intangible asset was below its carrying value. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $495.2 million recorded within special items in our consolidated statements of operations during the fourth quarter of 2016. Additionally, during this review, we also reassessed the asset’s indefinite-life classification and determined that the Molson core brands have characteristics that have evolved which now indicate a definite-life is more appropriate. These brands were therefore reclassified as definite-lived intangible assets and will be amortized over useful lives ranging from 30 to 50 years.    Our most recent impairment analysis, conducted as of October 1, 2017, the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter, indicated that the fair value of the U.S., Europe and Canada reporting units were estimated at approximately 28%, 18% and 26% in excess of their carrying values, respectively. Although the fair values of our reporting units are sufficiently in excess of their carrying values, the fair values are sensitive to potential unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows, macroeconomic conditions, market multiples or discount rates that could have an adverse impact. Any future impairment of the U.S., Europe or Canada reporting units or brands, or reclassification of indefinite-lived brands to definite-lived, may result in material charges that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Additionally, if the on-going integration of the MillerCoors and Miller International Business is unsuccessful due to, for example, unexpected challenges or difficulties, or adverse economic, market or industry conditions, material impairment charges may be incurred in the future. The testing of our goodwill for impairment is predicated upon our determination of our reporting units. Any change to the conclusion of our reporting units or the aggregation of components within our reporting units could result in a different outcome to our annual impairment test. See Part II-Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Critical Accounting Estimates and Part II-Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 11, ""Goodwill and Intangible Assets"" of the Notes for additional information related to the results of our annual impairment testing.Termination of one or more manufacturer/distribution agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    We manufacture and/or distribute products of other beverage companies through various joint venture, licensing, distribution, contract brewing or other similar arrangements, such as our agreement to import, market, distribute and sell Heineken in Canada and our arrangements to brew and distribute Beck's, Stella Artois, Lowenbrau and 25Table of ContentsSpaten and to distribute Corona in Central Europe. Our inability to renew or the loss of one or more of these arrangements, as a result of industry consolidation or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, our 2015 Europe results were adversely impacted by the termination of our brewing and kegging agreement with Heineken under which we produced and packaged the Foster’s and Kronenbourg brands in the U.K. Additionally, in 2017, our International segment was adversely impacted by the loss of the Modelo brands in Japan.    Changes in various supply chain standards or agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Our business includes various joint venture and industry agreements which standardize parts of the supply chain system. An example includes our warehousing and customer delivery systems in Canada organized under joint venture agreements with other brewers. Any negative change in these agreements or material terms within these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    We rely on a small number of suppliers to obtain the packaging materials we need to operate our business. The inability to obtain materials could unfavorably affect our ability to produce our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    We purchase certain types of packaging materials including aluminum cans and bottles, glass bottles and paperboard from a small number of suppliers. Consolidation of packaging materials suppliers has reduced local supply alternatives and increased risks of supply disruptions. The inability of any of these suppliers to meet our production requirements without sufficient time to develop an alternative source could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Additionally, if the financial condition of these suppliers deteriorates our business and financial results could be adversely impacted. Our suppliers’ financial condition is affected in large part by conditions and events that are beyond our and their control, including: competitive and general market conditions in the locations in which they operate; the availability of capital and other financing resources on reasonable terms; loss of major customers; or disruptions of bottling operations that may be caused by strikes, work stoppages, labor unrest or natural disasters. A deterioration of the financial condition or results of operations of one or more of our major suppliers could adversely affect our business and financial results.    Risks associated with operating our joint ventures may materially adversely affect our business and financial results.    We have entered into several joint ventures, including our joint ventures with Ball Corporation (i.e. Rocky Mountain Metal Container), and with Owens-Brockway Glass Container Inc. (i.e. Rocky Mountain Bottle Company), for a portion of our aluminum and glass packaging supply in the U.S. We may enter into additional joint ventures in the future. Our joint venture partners may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or with the goals of the joint venture. In addition, we compete against our joint venture partners in certain of our other markets. Disagreements with our business partners may impede our ability to maximize the benefits of our partnerships. Our joint venture arrangements may require us, among other matters, to pay certain costs or to make certain capital investments or to seek our joint venture partner's consent to take certain actions. In addition, our joint venture partners may be unable or unwilling to meet their economic or other obligations under the operative documents, and we may be required to either fulfill those obligations alone to ensure the ongoing success of a joint venture or to dissolve and liquidate a joint venture. For example, effective in 2014 we terminated our Modelo Molson Imports, L.P. joint venture that imported, distributed and marketed the Modelo beer brand portfolio across all Canadian provinces and territories which had an adverse effect on our Canadian volumes and financial results.     Our operations in developing and emerging markets expose us to additional risks which could harm our business and financial results.    We expect our operations in developing and emerging markets to become more significant to our operating results as we continue to further expand internationally, including in connection with our acquisition of the Miller International Business. In certain of these markets, we have limited operating experience and may not succeed. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our operations in these markets expose us to additional risks, including: changes in local political, economic, social and labor conditions; restrictions on foreign ownership and investments; repatriation of cash earned in countries outside the U.S.; import and export requirements; increased costs to ensure compliance with complex foreign laws and regulations; currency exchange rate fluctuations; a less developed and less certain legal and regulatory environment, which among other things can create uncertainty with regard to liability issues; longer payment cycles, increased credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud; and other challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences.    In addition, as a global company, we are subject to foreign and U.S. laws and regulations designed to combat governmental corruption, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, each of which could have a materially negative effect on our brands and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign 26Table of ContentsCorrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, there can be no assurance that our employees, business partners or agents will not violate our policies.Changes to the regulation of the distribution systems for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results.    Many countries in which we operate regulate the distribution of alcohol products and if those regulations were changed, it could alter our business practices and have material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, in the U.S. market, there is a three-tier distribution system that governs the sale of malt beverage products. That system, consisting of required separation of manufacturers, distributors and retailers, dates back to the repeal of prohibition and is periodically subject to legal challenges. To the extent that such challenges are successful and allow changes to the three-tier system, such changes could have a material adverse effect on our U.S. segment results of operations. Further, in Canada, our products are required to be distributed through each province's respective provincial liquor board. Additionally, in certain Canadian provinces, we rely on our joint venture arrangements, such as BRI and BDL, to distribute our products via retail outlets that are mandated and regulated by provincial government regulators. BRI owns and operates commercial retail outlets, known as The Beer Store, in Ontario, and BDL facilitates the distribution of our products in the Western Canadian provinces. If provincial regulation should change, the costs to adjust our distribution methods could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Our consolidated financial statements are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, most significantly the Canadian dollar and the European operating currencies such as, Euro, British Pound, Czech Koruna, Croatian Kuna, Serbian Dinar, New Romanian Leu, Bulgarian Lev and Hungarian Forint.    We hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in different currencies, most significantly in Canada and throughout Europe. Because our financial statements are presented in USD, we must translate our assets, liabilities, income and expenses into USD. Increases and decreases in the value of the USD will affect, perhaps adversely, the value of these items in our financial statements, even if their local currency value has not changed. Additionally, we are exposed to currency transaction risks related to transactions denominated in currencies other than one of the functional currencies of our operating entities, such as the purchase of certain raw material inputs or capital expenditures, as well as sales transactions and debt issuances or other incurred obligations. Further, certain actions by the government of any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our results and financial position. To the extent that we fail to adequately manage these risks through our risk management policies intended to protect our exposure to currency movements, which may affect our operations, including if our hedging arrangements do not effectively or completely hedge changes in foreign currency rates, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. As a result of the U.K. vote to leave the European Union, the GBP experienced a significant decline in comparison to USD and EUR and may continue to be volatile. Any significant further weakening of the GBP to the USD will have an adverse impact on our European revenues as reported in USD due to the importance of U.K. sales. Additionally, the strengthening of the USD against the Canadian dollar, European currencies and various other global currencies would adversely impact our USD reported results due to the impact on foreign currency translation.Changes in tax, environmental, trade or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing, trade and other regulations could cause volatility or have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Our business is highly regulated by national, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in various jurisdictions regarding such matters as tariffs, licensing requirements, trade and pricing practices, labeling, advertising, promotion and marketing practices, relationships with distributors, environmental matters, ingredient regulations, and other matters. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent re-evaluation, varying interpretations and political debate and inquiries from government regulators charged with their enforcement, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, on December 22, 2017, H.R. 1, also known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”), was enacted in the U.S. This enactment resulted in a number of significant changes to U.S. federal income tax law for U.S. corporations.  Most notably, the statutory federal corporate income tax rate was changed from 35% to 21% for corporations and, as a result, we recorded an estimated net tax benefit of approximately $434 million in our consolidated statements of operations during the fourth quarter of 2017 driven by the effects of the 2017 Tax Act on our deferred tax positions as of December 31, 2017. Our initial assessment of the impacts of the 2017 Tax Act is preliminary as we continue to evaluate the 2017 Tax Act and understand its implications, as well as the related, and yet to be issued, regulator rules, regulations and interpretations. If our complete and final assessment and understanding of the 2017 Tax Act differs significantly from this initial assessment, or the forthcoming rules, regulations and interpretations change our preliminary conclusions, the resulting impacts could have a material adverse impact on our tax rate and cash tax expectations. Additionally, modifications of U.S. laws and policies governing foreign trade and investment (including trade agreements and tariffs, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement or aluminum tariffs currently being evaluated by the U.S. government) could adversely affect our supply chain, business and results of operations. Failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or changes in these laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof, or in tax, environmental, excise tax levels imposed or any other laws or regulations could result in the loss, revocation or suspension of our licenses, permits or approvals and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of, and potential future developments in, complex 27Table of Contentsdomestic and international tax laws and regulations, the amount and timing of future taxable income and the interaction of such laws and regulations among jurisdictions. Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded. Finally, advocates of prohibition and other severe restrictions on the marketing and sales of alcohol are becoming increasingly organized and coordinated on a global basis, seeking to impose laws or regulations or to bring actions against us, to curtail substantially the consumption of alcohol, including beer, in developed and developing markets. To the extent such views gain traction in regulations of jurisdictions in which we do or plan to do business, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, in early 2016, the government of Bihar, India, the largest state in India in which our International segment operates, announced a complete prohibition on the sale and distribution of alcohol.    Climate change and water availability may negatively affect our business and financial results.    There is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures could cause significant changes in global weather patterns and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Changing weather patterns and more volatile weather conditions could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions which may impact quality, limit availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities, such as hops, barley and other cereal grains, which are important ingredients for our products. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain, distribution networks and routes to market, or impact demand for our products. In addition, public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. Clean water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and climate change may increase water scarcity and cause a deterioration of water quality in areas where we maintain brewing operations. The competition for water among domestic, agricultural and manufacturing users is increasing in some of our brewing communities. Even where water is widely available, water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain our operations.     Loss or closure of a major brewery or other key facility, due to unforeseen or catastrophic events or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Our business could be interrupted and our financial results could be materially adversely impacted by physical risks such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, terror attacks and other natural disasters or catastrophic events that damage or destroy one of our breweries or key facilities or the key facilities of our significant suppliers. Additionally, certain catastrophes are not covered by our general insurance policies, which could result in significant unrecoverable losses. Furthermore, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted by under-investment in physical assets or production capacity, including contract brewing and effect on priority of our brands if production capacity is limited. Further, significant excess capacity at any of our breweries as a result of increased efficiencies in our supply chain process or continued volume declines, could result in under-utilization of our assets, which could lead to excess overhead expenses or additional costs incurred associated with the closure of one or more of our facilities. For example, as part of a strategic review of our supply chain network, certain breweries and bottling lines were closed during 2015 and 2016 and we incurred related costs during 2017. We regularly review our supply chain network to ensure that our supply chain capacity is aligned with the needs of the business. Such reviews could potentially result in further closures and the related costs could be material.    Failure to successfully identify, complete or integrate attractive acquisitions and joint ventures into our existing operations could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.    We have made a number of acquisitions and entered into several strategic joint ventures. In order to compete in the consolidating global brewing industry, we anticipate that we may, from time to time, in the future acquire additional businesses or enter into additional joint ventures that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our business such as the Acquisition. Potential risks associated with acquisitions and joint ventures could include, among other things: our ability to identify attractive acquisitions and joint ventures; our ability to offer potential acquisition targets and joint venture partners' competitive transaction terms; our ability to raise capital on reasonable terms to finance attractive acquisitions and joint ventures; our ability to realize the benefits or cost savings that we expect to realize as a result of the acquisition or joint venture; diversion of management's attention; our ability to successfully integrate our businesses with the business of the acquired company; motivating, recruiting and retaining key employees; conforming standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures among our company and the acquired company; consolidating and streamlining sales, marketing and corporate operations; potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies; loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business; and managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations following completion of an acquisition or entry into a joint venture. Poor investment performance of pension plan holdings and other factors impacting pension plan costs could unfavorably affect our business, liquidity and our financial results.    Our costs of providing defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on the plans' assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, exchange rate fluctuations, future government regulation, 28Table of Contentsglobal equity prices, and our required and/or voluntary contributions to the plans. While we comply with the minimum funding requirements, we have certain qualified pension plans with obligations which exceed the value of the plans' assets. These funding requirements also may require contributions even when there is no reported deficit. Without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans' assets, and depending upon the other factors as listed above, we could be required to fund the plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations (or the timing of such contributions) could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, credit rating, cost of borrowing, financial position and/or results of operations. For example, following the completion of the triennial review of the U.K. pension plan with the plan's trustees in 2014, we made a GBP 150 million contribution to our U.K. pension plan in January 2015, based on the underfunded status of the plan and the evaluation of the plan's performance and long-term obligations. In addition, we made pension plan contributions during 2017 of approximately $310 million, including $200 million of discretionary contributions to the U.S. pension plan.    We depend on key personnel, the loss of whom could harm our business.    The loss of the services and expertise of any key employee could harm our business. Our future success depends on our ability to identify, attract and retain qualified personnel on a timely basis. Turnover of senior management can adversely impact our stock price, our results of operations and our client relationships and may make recruiting for future management positions more difficult. In addition, we must successfully integrate any new management personnel that we hire within our organization, or who join our organization as a result of an acquisition, in order to achieve our operating objectives, and changes in other key management positions may temporarily affect our financial performance and results of operations as new management becomes familiar with our business.Due to a high concentration of workers represented by unions or trade councils in Canada, Europe, and the U.S., we could be significantly affected by labor strikes, work stoppages or other employee-related issues.    As of December 31, 2017, approximately 55%, 40%, and 28% of our Canadian, European and U.S. workforces, respectively, are represented by trade unions. Stringent labor laws in certain of our key markets expose us to a greater risk of loss should we experience labor disruptions in those markets. A prolonged labor strike, work stoppage or other employee-related issue, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, in the first quarter of 2017, our Toronto brewery unionized employees commenced a labor strike initiated from on-going negotiations of the collective bargaining agreement.  This labor strike resulted in slower than expected production at the Toronto brewery in the first quarter of 2017.  From time to time, our collective bargaining agreements come due for renegotiation. Currently, we are in collective bargaining with our Montreal brewery, distribution and sales unions and, if we are unable to timely complete negotiations, affected employees may strike, which could have an adverse effect on our Canadian business and financial results.Because of our reliance on third-party service providers and internal and outsourced systems for our information technology and certain other administrative functions, we could experience a disruption to our business.    We rely extensively on information services providers worldwide for our information technology functions including network, help desk, hardware and software configuration. Additionally, we rely on internal networks and information systems and other technology, including the internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement and supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments. We use information systems for certain human resource activities and to process our employee benefits, as well as to process financial information for internal and external reporting purposes and to comply with various reporting, legal and tax requirements. As information systems are critical to many of our operating activities, our business may be impacted by system shutdowns, service disruptions or security breaches. Additionally, if one of our service providers were to fail and we were unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner, we could be unable to properly administer our outsourced functions. A breach of our information systems could cause material financial or reputational harm. Our internal and outsourced systems may also be the target of cyber-attacks or other breaches to our security, which, if successful, could expose us to the loss of key business, employee, customer or vendor information and disruption of our operations.  If our information systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our remediation plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results and we may lose revenue and profits as a result of our inability to timely prepare, distribute, invoice and collect payments from our customers. Misuse, leakage or falsification of information could result in a violation of data privacy laws and regulations, or damage our reputation and credibility. In addition, we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information and may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight or consumers may avoid our brands due to negative publicity. We could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.29Table of ContentsIf the Pentland Trust and the Coors Trust do not agree on a matter submitted to our stockholders or if a super-majority of our board of directors do not agree on certain actions, generally the matter will not be approved, even if beneficial to us or favored by other stockholders or a majority of our board of directors.    Pentland Securities (1981) Inc. (the ""Pentland Trust"") (a company controlled by the Molson family and related parties) and the Adolph Coors, Jr. Trust (the ""Coors Trust""), which together control more than 90% of our Class A common stock and Class A exchangeable shares, have a voting trust agreement through which they have combined their voting power over the shares of our Class A common stock and the Class A exchangeable shares that they own. If these two stockholders do not agree to vote in favor of a matter submitted to a stockholder vote (other than the election of directors), the voting trustees are required to vote all of the Class A common stock and Class A exchangeable shares deposited in the voting trust against the matter. There is no other mechanism in the voting trust agreement to resolve a potential deadlock between these stockholders. Therefore, if either the Pentland Trust or the Coors Trust is unwilling to vote in favor of a proposal that is subject to a stockholder vote, we would be unable to implement the proposal even if our board of directors, management or other stockholders believe the proposal is beneficial to us. Similarly, our bylaws require the authorization of a super-majority (two-thirds) of the board of directors to take certain transformational actions. Thus, it is possible that the Company will not be authorized to take action even if it is supported by a simple majority of the board of directors.    The interests of the controlling stockholders may differ from those of other stockholders and could prevent the Company from making certain decisions or taking certain actions that would be in the best interest of the other stockholders.    Our Class B common stock has fewer voting rights than our Class A common stock and holders of our Class A common stock have the ability to effectively control or have a significant influence over certain company actions requiring stockholder approval, which could have a material adverse effect on Class B stockholders. See Part II-Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 8, ""Stockholders' Equity"" of the Notes for additional information regarding voting rights of Class A and Class B stockholders.Risks Specific to the United States Segment    Our U.S. business is highly dependent on independent distributors to sell our products, with no assurance that these distributors will effectively sell our products.    We sell nearly all of our products, including all of our imported products, in the U.S. to independent distributors for resale to retail outlets. These independent distributors are entitled to exclusive territories and protected from termination by state statutes and regulations. Consequently, if we are not allowed, or are unable under acceptable terms or at all, to replace unproductive or inefficient distributors, our business, financial position and results of operation may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Changes in the social acceptability of alcohol and the political view of the alcohol industry may harm the U.S. business.    The alcoholic beverage industry is regularly the subject of anti-alcohol activist activity related to the health concerns from the misuse of alcohol and concerns regarding underage drinking and exposure to alcohol advertisements. Negative publicity regarding beer and changes in consumer perceptions in relation to beer and other alcoholic beverages, could adversely affect the sale and consumption of our products which could, in turn, adversely affect our business and financial conditions. Additionally, the concerns around alcohol could result in advertising, selling and other restrictions imposed by regulators. Moreover, it could result in increased taxes associated with alcohol sales, which also could negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition if consumers and customers change their purchasing patterns.Risks Specific to the Canada SegmentWe may experience adverse effects on our Canada business and financial results due to declines in the overall Canadian beer industry, continued price discounting, increased cost of goods sold and higher taxes.    If the Canadian beer market continues to decline, the impact to our financial results could be exacerbated due to our significant share of the overall market. Additionally, continuation or acceleration of price discounting, in Ontario, Québec, Alberta or other provinces, as well as increases in our cost of goods sold, could adversely impact our business. Further, changes in the Canadian tax legislation, such as the potential for an increase in beer excise taxes, could decrease our net sales. Although the ultimate impact is currently unknown, the legalization of cannabis in Canada may result in a shift of discretionary income away from our products or a change in consumer preferences away from beer or our other products. Moreover, the future success and earnings growth of the Canada business depends, in part, on our ability to efficiently conduct our operations. Failure to generate significant cost savings and margin improvement through our ongoing initiatives could adversely affect our profitability.    If we are required to move away from the industry standard returnable bottle we use today, we may incur unexpected losses.    Along with other brewers in Canada, we currently use an industry standard returnable bottle which represents approximately 31% of total volume sales (excluding imports) in Canada. Changes to the Industry Standard Bottle Agreement could impact our use of the industry standard returnable bottle. If we cease to use the industry standard returnable 30Table of Contentsbottle, our current bottle inventory and a portion of our bottle packaging equipment could become obsolete and could result in a material write-off of these assets.Risks Specific to the Europe SegmentThe vote in the U.K. to leave the European Union could adversely affect us.  Approximately 11% of our consolidated net sales in 2017 came from the U.K., which is our largest market in Europe. In a referendum held on June 23, 2016, a majority of voters in the U.K. voted in favor of the U.K. leaving the European Union. The U.K. vote to leave the European Union triggered a decline in the GBP in comparison to USD and EUR. Weakening of economic conditions or economic uncertainties tend to harm the beer business, and if such conditions emerge in the U.K. or in the rest of Europe, it may have a material adverse effect on our Europe segment. In addition, any significant weakening of the GBP to the USD will have an adverse impact on our European revenues as reported in USD due to the importance of U.K. sales. The U.K. is expected to leave the EU on March 29, 2019. Because the terms of the exit are still unknown, we may face regulatory uncertainty and may need to quickly adapt to regulatory changes and market volatility.     Economic trends and intense competition in European markets could unfavorably affect our profitability.    Our European businesses have been, and, in the future may be, adversely affected by conditions in the global financial markets and general economic and political conditions, as well as a weakening of their respective currencies versus the U.S. dollar. Additionally, we face intense competition in certain of our European markets, particularly with respect to pricing, which could lead to reduced sales or profitability. In particular, the on-going focus by large competitors in Europe to drive increased market share through aggressive pricing strategies could adversely affect our sales and results of operations. In addition, in recent years, beer volume sales in Europe have been shifting from pubs and restaurants (on-premise) to retail stores (off-premise) as well as from premium or core brands to value brands, for the industry in general. Margins on sales of value brands and sales to off-premise customers tend to be lower than margins on sales to on-premise customers, and, as a result, continuation or acceleration of these trends would further adversely affect our profitability.Risks Specific to the International SegmentAn inability to expand our operations in emerging markets could adversely affect our growth prospects.    Our ability to further grow our International segment in emerging markets depends on our ability: to react to social, economic, and political conditions in those markets; to create effective product distribution networks and consumer brand awareness in new markets; and, in many cases, to find appropriate local partners. Due to product price, local regulatory changes, local competition from competitors that are larger and have more resources than we do, and cultural differences, or absence of effective routes to market, there is no assurance that our products will be accepted in any particular emerging market. If we are unable to expand our businesses in emerging markets, our growth prospects could be adversely affected.Risks Specific to Our Discontinued OperationsIndemnities provided to the purchaser of 83% of the Cervejarias Kaiser Brasil S.A. (""Kaiser"") business in Brazil could result in future cash outflows and statement of operations charges.    In 2006, we sold our 83% ownership interest in Kaiser to FEMSA Cerveza S.A. de C.V. (""FEMSA""). The terms of the sale agreement require us to indemnify FEMSA for exposures related to certain tax, civil and labor contingencies and certain purchased tax credits. The ultimate resolution of these claims is not under our control. These indemnity obligations are recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, however, we could incur future statement of operations charges as facts further develop resulting in changes to our estimates or changes in our assessment of probability of loss on these items as well as due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Due to the uncertainty involved in the ultimate outcome and timing of these contingencies, significant adjustments to the carrying value of our indemnity liabilities and corresponding statement of operations charges/credits could result in the future"
10,TAP,MOLSON COORS BREWING CO,2017-02-14,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORSInvesting in our Company involves risk. The reader should carefully consider the following risk factors and the other information contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks set forth below are those that management believes are most likely to have a material adverse effect on us, however are not a comprehensive description of the risks facing our Company. We may also be subject to other risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial but may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods. If the following risks or uncertainties, individually or in combination, actually occur, they may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects.16Table of ContentsRisks Specific to the AcquisitionWe may not be able to realize anticipated cost and operational synergies from the Acquisition.    The success of the Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize anticipated cost and operational synergies. Our success in realizing these cost synergies, and the timing of this realization, depends on the successful integration of our business and operations with the acquired business and operations. Even if we are able to integrate the acquired businesses and operations successfully, this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the cost and operational synergies of the Acquisition that we currently expect within the anticipated time frame or at all.The Acquisition subjects us to significant additional liabilities, costs and other risks.    We have assumed all of the liabilities of MillerCoors, including, among others, significant pension and other post-employment benefit liabilities. The assumed liabilities put additional pressure on our ability to successfully meet our deleveraging commitments and grow our business over time as discussed further below. In addition, as a result of the Acquisition, we are subject to the risks of the U.S. beer market to a much greater extent, and a significant majority of our overall business is in mature, low growth beer markets, such as the U.S., Canada and the U.K. Economic conditions and consumer preferences in these markets will have a greater impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We may also incur additional costs in the course of the integration of the MillerCoors business and the international Miller brand portfolio, and we cannot be certain that the elimination of duplicative costs or the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will offset the transaction and integration costs in the near term, or at all. Integrations of acquired businesses are complex, costly, and time-consuming, and such activities divert management’s time and attention. The assumption of liabilities in the Acquisition, coupled with any delays, additional costs, or issues experienced during the integration period could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Acquisition has impacted our financial position and could adversely impact our credit ratings.    We raised significant capital to fund the Acquisition, including the issuance of our 2016 Notes, as defined in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the borrowings on our term loan completed in October 2016, in addition to our Class B common stock offering completed in February 2016. Ratings agencies may downgrade our credit ratings below their current investment grade levels if we are unable to meet our deleveraging commitments. A ratings downgrade could increase our costs of future borrowing and harm our ability to refinance our debt in the future on acceptable terms or access the capital markets. We currently intend to hold per share dividends constant and have suspended both our dividend target of 18% to 22% of trailing annualized EBITDA and our share repurchase program. We also intend to use cash from operations to reduce our debt level, which will reduce funds available for other operational or strategic needs and may increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions. See “Risks Specific to Our Company” below for additional risks relating to our debt. We face numerous risks associated with the acquisition and integration of the Miller brand portfolio outside the U.S. and Puerto Rico.    The acquisition of the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico may subject us to unknown expenses and liabilities. These risks arise because we acquired the Miller brand portfolio from ABI at a time when it had no access to historical financial statements which were then in the possession of SABMiller. Accordingly, our due diligence was limited. We protected ourselves via a downward price adjustment described in more detail below. The success of our acquisition of the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico will depend, in part, on our ability to realize all or some of the anticipated synergies and other benefits from integrating this business with our existing businesses and operations. The integration process will be complex, costly and time-consuming as the operations from the Miller brand portfolio assets are in over 50 foreign countries. The difficulties of integrating the operations include, among others:•failure to implement our business plan for the combined business; •unanticipated issues in integrating manufacturing, logistics, information, communications and other systems; •possible inconsistencies in standards, controls, contracts, procedures and policies;•impacts of change in control provisions in contracts and agreements;•failure to retain key customers and suppliers; •unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations; 17Table of Contents•failure to recruit and retain key employees to operate the combined business; •inherent operating risks in the business; •unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities; •increased foreign currency exposures which could adversely affect the amounts recorded for our foreign       assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and could have a negative effect on our results of operations; •unfamiliarity with operating in many of the countries in which the international Miller brand portfolio     operates;•reliance on competitors, ABI (or Asahi, in the case of Europe), to provide transition services for thisbusiness;•failure to develop sustainable routes to market upon the expiration of transition services;•difficulty in fully separating the Miller brand portfolio from SABMiller’s current brand portfolio; and•inability to perform satisfactory due diligence on the business prior to closing of the Acquisition.We may not be able to maintain the levels of revenue, earnings or operating efficiency that each of the Company and the international Miller brand portfolio had achieved or might achieve separately. Although we have a downward purchase price adjustment if the unaudited U.S. GAAP earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the international Miller brand portfolio for the twelve months prior to closing is below $70 million, such adjustment may not be adequate to protect us from the future harm of acquiring an underperforming or declining brand portfolio. In addition, we may not accomplish the integration of the international Miller brand portfolio smoothly, successfully or within the anticipated costs or timeframe. Moreover, the markets in which the international Miller brand portfolio operates may not experience the growth rates expected and any economic downturn affecting those markets could negatively impact the international Miller brand portfolio. These markets are in differing stages of development and may experience more volatility than expected or face more operating risks than in the more mature markets in which we have historically operated. If we experience difficulties with the integration process or if the international Miller brand portfolio or the markets in which it operates deteriorate, the potential cost savings, growth opportunities and other synergies of the acquisition of the Miller brand portfolio outside the U.S. and Puerto Rico may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. In such case, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively impacted.Risks Specific to Our CompanyThe global beer industry is constantly evolving, and our position within the global beer industry and our markets in which we operate may fundamentally change. If we do not successfully transform along with the evolving industry and market dynamics, then the result could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    The brewing industry has significantly evolved over the years becoming an increasingly global beer market. For many years, the industry operated primarily on local presence with modest international expansion achieved through export, license and partnership arrangements, whereas it has now become increasingly complex as the consolidation of brewers has occurred globally resulting in fewer major global market participants. At the same time, smaller local brewers within certain geographies are seeing accelerated growth as consumers increasingly place value on locally-produced and/or regionally-sourced products. As a result of the increased global consolidation of brewers and the dynamic of an expanding new segment within the industry with new market entrants, the markets in which we operate, particularly the more mature markets, may evolve at a disadvantage to our current market position and local governments may intervene, which may fundamentally accelerate transformational changes to such markets. For example, U.S. and Canada beer markets have long consisted of a select number of significant market participants with government-regulated routes to market. However, recent evolution in these markets and emerging changes to consumer preferences have introduced a significant expansion of market entrants and resulted in increased consumer choice and market competition, as well as increased government scrutiny. Specifically, in the U.S., we have experienced vast expansion in the craft beer industry and have accordingly strategically acquired several craft breweries in the recent year. If our competitors are able to respond more quickly to the evolving trends within the craft beer industry, or if our new products are not successful, our U.S. business may be adversely impacted. In Canada, changes to regulations, distribution models, and packaging requirements, such as government-owned retail outlets and industry standard returnable bottles may be disadvantageous to us. Currently, in Ontario and other provinces, provincial governments are reviewing and/or changing this historical foundation as a result of this market evolution and increased demand by some for government intervention to 18Table of Contentsenhance competition and choice. As further described below, in addition to these risks related to growing competition and market evolution, the existing Ontario distribution models may be changed in ways that are unfavorable to us and the industry standard returnable bottle agreement may change in ways that adversely impact our operating model across Canada. If we are unsuccessful in evolving with, and navigating through, the changes to the markets in which we operate, the above risk could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Competition in our markets could require us to reduce prices or increase capital and other expenditures or cause us to lose sales volume, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    In most of our markets, our primary competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, production and distribution resources than we do, and are more diverse in terms of their geographies and brand portfolios. In all of the markets in which we operate, aggressive marketing strategies, such as reduced pricing, brand positioning, and increased capital investments by these competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, continuing consolidation among major global brewers may lead to stronger or new competitors, loss of partner brands, negative impacts on our distributor networks and pressures from marketing and pricing tactics by competitors. Further, distributor consolidation could reduce our ability to promote our brands in the market in a manner that enhances rather than diminishes their value, as well as reduce our ability to manage our pricing effectively. Failure to generate significant cost savings and margin improvement through our ongoing initiatives could adversely affect our profitability and these factors could result in lower margins or loss of market share, due to increased pressures for reduced pricing or difficulties in increasing prices while remaining competitive within our markets, as well as the need for increased capital investment, marketing and other expenditures. Moreover, most of our major markets are mature, so growth opportunities may be more limited to us than to our competitors. For example, sales in the U.S. were approximately $7.7 billion in 2016 and sales in Canada accounted for approximately 27.5% of our total 2016 sales. The above risk, if realized, could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Our success as an enterprise depends largely on the success of relatively few products in several mature markets specific to the beer industry; if consumer preferences shift away from our products or consumption of our products decline, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.    Our Coors Light and Miller Lite brands in the U.S., Coors Light, Molson Canadian brands, Coors Banquet and Carling in Canada, and Carling, Staropramen, Jelen, Ozujsko and Coors Light brands in Europe represented approximately half of each respective segment's sales volumes in 2016. Additionally, several of our brands represent a significant share of their respective market, therefore volatility in these markets could disproportionately impact the performance of these brands. Consequently, any material shift in consumer preferences away from these brands, or from the categories in which they compete, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Consumer preferences and tastes may shift away from our brands or beer generally due to, among others, changing taste preferences, demographics, downturn in economic conditions or perceived value, as well as changes in consumers' perception of our brands due to negative publicity, regulatory actions or litigation. Recently, there has been more attention focused on the health concerns and harmful effects of alcoholic beverages which could result in a change in the social acceptability of beer and other alcoholic beverages which could materially impact our sales. Additionally, in some of our major markets, specifically Canada and the U.S., there has been a recent shift in consumer preferences within the total beer market away from premium brands to ""craft beer"" produced by small, regional microbreweries, as well as a shift within the total alcohol beverage market from beer to wine and spirits. Moreover, several of our major markets are mature and we have significant share, therefore small movements in consumer preference can disproportionately impact our results. As a result, a shift in consumer preferences away from our products or beer could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    The success of our business relies heavily on brand image, reputation, product quality and protection of intellectual property.    It is important that we maintain and increase the image and reputation of our existing products. Concerns about product quality, even when unsubstantiated, could be harmful to our image and reputation of our products. While we have quality control programs in place, in the event we experienced an issue with product quality, we may experience recalls or liability in addition to business disruption which could further negatively impact brand image and reputation. Deterioration to our brand equity may be difficult to combat or reverse and could have a material effect on our business and financial results. In addition, because our brands carry family names, personal activities by certain members of the Molson or Coors families that harm their public image or reputation could have an adverse effect on our brands. Further, our success is dependent on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, including trademarks, patents, domain names, trade secrets and know-how. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be sufficient or that third parties will not infringe upon or misappropriate these rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Continued weak, or further weakening of, economic conditions in the markets in which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Beer consumption in many of our markets is closely tied to general economic conditions and a significant portion of our portfolio consists of premium and above premium brands. 19Table of ContentsDifficult macroeconomic conditions in our markets, such as decreases in per capita income and level of disposable income driven by increases to inflation, income taxes, the cost of living, unemployment levels, political or economic instability or other country specific factors could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products. For example, we have continued to experience economic pressures in certain European markets, resulting in an increased consumer trend toward value brands within the impacted markets. A continuation of this trend or further deterioration of the current economic conditions could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. A significant portion of our consolidated net sales revenues will be concentrated in the U.S. Therefore, unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, such as a recession or slowed economic growth, in the U.S. could negatively affect consumer demand for our product in this important market. Under difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products or by shifting away from our products to lower-priced products offered by other companies. Softer consumer demand for our products in the U.S. could reduce our profitability and could negatively affect our overall financial performance.     Our debt level, which increased significantly in 2016 to fund the Acquisition, subjects us to financial and operating risks, and the agreements governing such debt subject us to financial and operating covenants and restrictions. Our indebtedness subjects us to financial and operating covenants, including restrictions on priority indebtedness, leverage thresholds, liens, certain types of secured debt and certain types of sale lease-back transactions and transfers of assets, which may limit our flexibility in responding to our business needs. If we are not able to maintain compliance with stated financial covenants or if we breach other covenants in any debt agreement, we could be in default under such agreement. Such a default would adversely affect our credit ratings, may allow our creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness, and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies.Our significant debt level and the terms of such debt could, among other things:     •make it more difficult to satisfy our obligations under the terms of our indebtedness;    •limit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all;    •limit our flexibility to plan for and adjust to changing business and market conditions and increase our     vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;    •require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to make interest and principal payments on our     debt, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future acquisitions, working capital, business     activities, and other general corporate requirements; •limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, strategic     opportunities, including acquisitions or other investments, to fund growth or for general corporate purposes,     even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity, particularly if any ratings assigned to our debt securitiesby rating organizations were revised downward; and•adversely impact our competitive position in the industry.Failure to comply with our debt covenants or a deterioration in our credit rating could have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain future financing at competitive rates and/or our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness.    Under the terms of each of our debt facilities, we must comply with certain restrictions. These include restrictions on priority indebtedness (certain threshold percentages of secured consolidated net tangible assets), leverage thresholds, liens, and restrictions on certain types of sale lease-back transactions and transfers of assets. Failure to comply with these restrictions or maintain our credit rating may result in issues with our current financing structure and potential future financing requirements. A deterioration in our credit rating could also affect our ability to obtain future financing or refinance our current debt, as well as increase our borrowing rates, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Default by or failure of one or more of our counterparty financial institutions could cause us to incur significant losses.    As part of our risk management activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, including, among others, forward contracts, commodity swap contracts, option contracts, with various financial institutions. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the United States and abroad. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by, or failure of, counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to retrieve our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty's liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy 20Table of Contentsproceedings. In the event of default by or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.    Our consolidated financial statements are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, most significantly the Canadian dollar and the European operating currencies such as, Euro, British Pound, Czech Koruna, Croatian Kuna, Serbian Dinar, New Romanian Leu, Bulgarian Lev and Hungarian Forint.    We hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in different currencies, most significantly in Canada and throughout Europe. Because our financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars (""USD""), we must translate our assets, liabilities, income and expenses into USD. Increases and decreases in the value of the USD will affect, perhaps adversely, the value of these items in our financial statements, even if their local currency value has not changed. Additionally, we are exposed to currency transaction risks related to transactions denominated in currencies other than one of the functional currencies of our operating entities, such as the purchase of certain raw material inputs or capital expenditures, as well as sales transactions and debt issuances or other incurred obligations. Further, certain actions by the government of any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our results and financial position. To the extent that we fail to adequately manage these risks through our risk management policies intended to protect our exposure to currency movements, which may affect our operations, including if our hedging arrangements do not effectively or completely hedge changes in foreign currency rates, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. As a result the U.K. vote to leave the European Union, the GBP experienced a significant decline in comparison to USD and EUR and continues to be volatile. Any significant further weakening of the GBP to the USD will have an adverse impact on our European revenues as reported in USD due to the importance of U.K. sales. Additionally, the recent strengthening of the USD against the Canadian dollar, European currencies and various other global currencies, if continued, would adversely impact our USD reported results due to the impact on foreign currency translation.    Our operations face significant exposure to changes in commodity prices, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.    We use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials, some of which are purchased through supply contracts with third parties, to produce our products, including barley, malted barley, hops, corn, other various starches, water and packaging materials, including aluminum cans and bottles, glass and polyethylene terephthalate (“PET”) containers, as well as, cardboard and other paper products. We also use a significant amount of diesel fuel, natural gas and electricity in our operations. The supply and price of these raw materials and commodities can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including market demand, alternative sources for suppliers, global geopolitical events (especially as to their impact on crude oil prices and the resulting impact on diesel fuel prices), trade agreements among producing and consuming nations, governmental regulations, including tariffs, frosts, droughts and other weather conditions, economic factors affecting growth decisions, inflation, plant diseases and theft. To the extent any of the foregoing factors affect the availability or prices of ingredients or packaging or our hedging arrangements do not effectively or completely hedge changes in commodity price risks and we are not able to pass these increased costs along to customers, our financial results could be materially adversely impacted.We may incur impairments of the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets.    In connection with various business combinations, we have historically allocated material amounts of the related purchase prices to goodwill and other intangible assets that are considered to have indefinite useful lives. For example, as a result of the Acquisition, we have preliminarily allocated approximately $6.4 billion and $7.7 billion to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively. These assets are tested for impairment at least annually, using estimates and assumptions affected by factors such as economic and industry conditions and changes in operating performance. Additionally, in conjunction with the brand impairment tests, we also reassess each brand's indefinite-life classification. Potential resulting charges from an impairment of goodwill or brand intangible, as well as reclassification of an indefinite-lived to a definite-lived brand intangible, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, the results of our annual impairment testing completed as of October 1, 2016, indicated that the fair value of the Molson core brand indefinite-lived intangible asset was below its carrying value. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $495.2 million recorded within special items in our consolidated statements of operations during the fourth quarter of 2016. Additionally, during this review, we also reassessed the asset’s indefinite-life classification and determined that the Molson core brands have characteristics that have evolved which now indicate a definite-life is more appropriate. These brands were therefore reclassified as definite-lived intangible assets and will be amortized over useful lives ranging from 30 to 50 years.    Our most recent impairment analysis, conducted as of October 1, 2016, the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter, indicated that the fair value of our Canada reporting unit declined from the prior year, while our Europe reporting unit fair value remained comparable with the prior year, and therefore continues to be considered at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test. Specifically, the fair value of the Europe and Canada reporting units were estimated at approximately 14% and 29% in excess of their carrying values, respectively. The Europe reporting unit is therefore at risk of a future impairment in the event of significant unfavorable changes in the forecasted cash flows (including prolonged, or further weakening of, adverse economic conditions or significant unfavorable changes in tax, environmental or other regulations, including interpretations 21Table of Contentsthereof), terminal growth rates, market transaction multiples and/or weighted-average cost of capital utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis. Although the fair value in excess of the carrying value has increased for the Canada reporting unit from the October 1, 2015, testing date, the fair value is sensitive to potential unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows, macroeconomic conditions, market multiples or discount rates that could have an adverse impact. Any future impairment of the Europe or Canada reporting units or brands, or reclassification of indefinite-lived brands to definite-lived, may result in material charges that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Additionally, if the resulting integration of the MillerCoors and Miller global business is unsuccessful due to, for example, unexpected challenges or difficulties, or adverse economic, market or industry conditions, material impairment charges may be incurred in the future. The testing of our goodwill for impairment is predicated upon our determination of our reporting units. Any change to the conclusion of our reporting units or the aggregation of components within our reporting units could result in a different outcome to our annual impairment test. See Part II-Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Critical Accounting Estimates and Part II-Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 11, ""Goodwill and Intangible Assets"" of the Notes for additional information related to the results of our annual impairment testing.Termination of one or more manufacturer/distribution agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    We manufacture and/or distribute products of other beverage companies through various joint venture, licensing, distribution, contract brewing or other similar arrangements. The loss of one or more of these arrangements, as a result of industry consolidation or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, our 2015 Europe results were adversely impacted by the termination of our brewing and kegging agreement with Heineken under which we produced and packaged the Foster’s and Kronenbourg brands in the U.K. Additionally, Canada volumes were also adversely impacted by the termination of our license agreement with Miller Brewing Company (“Miller”) in 2015.     Changes in various supply chain standards or agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Our business includes various joint venture and industry agreements which standardize parts of the supply chain system. An example includes our warehousing and customer delivery systems in Canada organized under joint venture agreements with other brewers. Any negative change in these agreements or material terms within these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    We rely on a small number of suppliers to obtain the packaging materials we need to operate our business. The inability to obtain materials could unfavorably affect our ability to produce our products.    We purchase certain types of packaging materials including aluminum cans and bottles, glass bottles and paperboard from a small number of suppliers. Consolidation of packaging materials suppliers has reduced local supply alternatives and increased risks of supply disruptions. The inability of any of these suppliers to meet our production requirements without sufficient time to develop an alternative source could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Additionally, if the financial condition of these suppliers deteriorates our business and financial results could be adversely impacted. Our suppliers’ financial condition is affected in large part by conditions and events that are beyond our and their control, including competitive and general market conditions in the locations in which they operate; the availability of capital and other financing resources on reasonable terms; loss of major customers; or disruptions of bottling operations that may be caused by strikes, work stoppages, labor unrest or natural disasters. A deterioration of the financial condition or results of operations of one or more of our major suppliers could adversely affect our business.    Risks associated with operating our joint ventures may materially adversely affect our business and financial results.    We have entered into several joint ventures, including our joint ventures with Ball Corporation, Rocky Mountain Metal Container, and with Owens-Brockway Glass Container Inc., Rocky Mountain Bottle Company, for a portion of our aluminum and glass packaging supply in the United States. We may enter into additional joint ventures in the future. Our joint venture partners may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or with the goals of the joint venture. In addition, we compete against our joint venture partners in certain of our other markets. Disagreements with our business partners may impede our ability to maximize the benefits of our partnerships. Our joint venture arrangements may require us, among other matters, to pay certain costs or to make certain capital investments or to seek our joint venture partner's consent to take certain actions. In addition, our joint venture partners may be unable or unwilling to meet their economic or other obligations under the operative documents, and we may be required to either fulfill those obligations alone to ensure the ongoing success of a joint venture or to dissolve and liquidate a joint venture. For example, we terminated our MMI joint venture that imported, distributed and marketed the Modelo beer brand portfolio across all Canadian provinces and territories, which, since termination in the first quarter of 2014, has had an adverse effect on our Canadian volumes and financial results. The above risk, if realized, could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    22Table of ContentsOur operations in developing and emerging markets expose us to additional risks which could harm our business and financial results.    We expect our operations in developing and emerging markets to become more significant to our operating results as we continue to further expand internationally including in connection with our recent acquisition of the Miller brand portfolio outside the U.S. and Puerto Rico. In certain of these markets, we have limited operating experience and may not succeed. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our operations in these markets expose us to additional risks, including: changes in local political, economic, social and labor conditions; restrictions on foreign ownership and investments; repatriation of cash earned in countries outside the U.S.; import and export requirements; increased costs to ensure compliance with complex foreign laws and regulations; currency exchange rate fluctuations; a less developed and less certain legal and regulatory environment, which among other things can create uncertainty with regard to liability issues; longer payment cycles, increased credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud; and other challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences.    In addition, as a global company, we are subject to foreign and U.S. laws and regulations designed to combat governmental corruption, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, each of which could have a materially negative effect on our brands and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, there can be no assurance that our employees, business partners or agents will not violate our policies.Changes to the regulation of the distribution systems for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results.    Many countries in which we operate regulate the distribution of alcohol products and if those regulations were changed, it could alter our business practices and have material adverse effects on our business and financial results. For example, in the U.S. market, there is a three-tier distribution system that governs the sale of malt beverage products. That system, consisting of required separation of manufacturers, distributors and retailers, dates back to the repeal of prohibition and is periodically subject to legal challenges. To the extent that such challenges are successful and allow changes to the three-tier system, such changes could have a material adverse effect on our U.S. segment results of operations. Further, in Canada, our products are required to be distributed through each province's respective provincial liquor board. Additionally, in certain provinces, we rely on our joint venture arrangements, such as BRI and BDL, to distribute our products via retail outlets that are mandated and regulated by provincial government regulators. BRI owns and operates commercial retail outlets, known as The Beer Store, in Ontario, and BDL facilitates the distribution of our products in the Western provinces. If provincial regulation should change, the costs to adjust our distribution methods could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Changes in tax, environmental, trade or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing, trade and other regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Our business is highly regulated by national, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in various jurisdictions regarding such matters as tariffs, licensing requirements, trade and pricing practices, labeling, advertising, promotion and marketing practices, relationships with distributors, environmental matters, smoking bans at on-premise locations and other matters. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent re-evaluation, varying interpretations and political debate and inquiries from government regulators charged with their enforcement. An example of this is the regulatory assessments received in Europe in the first quarters of 2016 and 2015 and fourth quarter of 2014 related to the interpretation of the application of tax on the production and sale of our products for which we recorded a charge of approximately $50 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. If these assessments are upheld in full or in part, in addition to potentially recording an additional charge, we would be subject to increased taxes on future sales of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and operating income. In addition, U.S. legislative initiatives to reform U.S. tax law could have a material impact on our tax rate and our cash tax expectations, including our expected cash tax benefits related to the Acquisition. Modifications of U.S. laws and policies governing foreign trade and investment (including trade agreements and tariffs) could adversely affect our supply chain, business and results of operations. Failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or changes in these laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof, or in tax, environmental, excise tax levels imposed or any other laws or regulations could result in the loss, revocation or suspension of our licenses, permits or approvals and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, uncertainties exist with respect to adding new tax laws, the interpretation of, and potential future developments in, complex domestic and international tax laws and regulations and the amount and timing of future taxable income. Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded. Finally, advocates of prohibition and other severe restrictions on the marketing and sales of alcohol are becoming increasingly organized and coordinated on a global basis, seeking to impose laws or regulations or to bring actions against us, to curtail substantially the consumption of 23Table of Contentsalcohol, including beer, in developed and developing markets. To the extent such views gain traction in regulations of jurisdictions in which we do or plan to do business, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, in early 2016, the government of Bihar, India, the largest state in India in which MCI operates, announced a complete prohibition on the sale and distribution of alcohol, which if not reversed, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Climate change and water availability may negatively affect our business and financial results.    There is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures could cause significant changes in global weather patterns and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. While warmer weather has historically been associated with increased sales of beer, changing weather patterns could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions which may limit availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities, such as hops, barley and other cereal grains, which are important ingredients for our products. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. In addition, public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. Clean water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and climate change may increase water scarcity and cause a deterioration of water quality in areas where we maintain brewing operations. The competition for water among domestic, agricultural and manufacturing users is increasing in some of our brewing communities. Even where water is widely available, water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain our operations. The above risks, if realized, could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Loss or closure of a major brewery or other key facility, due to unforeseen or catastrophic events or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Our business and financial results could be materially adversely impacted by physical risks such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, other natural disasters or catastrophic events that damage or destroy one of our breweries or key facilities or the key facilities of our significant suppliers. Additionally, certain catastrophes are not covered by our general insurance policies, which could result in significant unrecoverable losses. In addition, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted by under-investment in physical assets or production capacity, including contract brewing and effect on priority of our brands if production capacity is limited. Further, significant excess capacity at any of our breweries as a result of increased efficiencies in our supply chain process or continued volume declines, could result in under-utilization of our assets, which could lead to excess overhead expenses or additional costs incurred associated with the closure of one or more of our facilities. For example, as part of a strategic review of our supply chain network, certain breweries and bottling lines were closed during 2015 and 2016 and we incurred related costs and for which we may incur additional costs during 2017. We regularly review our supply chain network to ensure that our supply chain capacity is aligned with the needs of the business. Such review could potentially result in further closures and the related costs could be material.    Failure to successfully identify, complete or integrate attractive acquisitions and joint ventures into our existing operations could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.    We have made a number of acquisitions and entered into several joint ventures. In order to compete in the consolidating global brewing industry, we anticipate that we may, from time to time, in the future acquire additional businesses or enter into additional joint ventures that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our business such as the Acquisition. See above ""Risks Specific to the Acquisition"" for further details. Potential risks associated with acquisitions and joint ventures could include, among other things: our ability to identify attractive acquisitions and joint ventures; our ability to offer potential acquisition targets and joint venture partners' competitive transaction terms; our ability to raise capital on reasonable terms to finance attractive acquisitions and joint ventures; our ability to realize the benefits or cost savings that we expect to realize as a result of the acquisition or joint venture; diversion of management's attention; our ability to successfully integrate our businesses with the business of the acquired company; motivating, recruiting and retaining key employees; conforming standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures among our company and the acquired company; consolidating and streamlining sales, marketing and corporate operations; potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies; loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business; and managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations following completion of an acquisition or entry into a joint venture. If an acquisition or joint venture is not successfully completed or integrated into our existing operations, our business and financial results could be materially adversely impacted.Poor investment performance of pension plan holdings and other factors impacting pension plan costs could unfavorably affect our business, liquidity and our financial results.    Our costs of providing defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on the plans' assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, exchange rate fluctuations, future government regulation, global equity prices, and our required and/or voluntary contributions to the plans. While we comply with the minimum funding requirements, we have certain qualified pension plans with obligations which exceed the value of the plans' assets. These 24Table of Contentsfunding requirements may also require contributions even when there is no reported deficit. Without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans' assets, and depending upon the other factors as listed above, we could be required to fund the plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations (or the timing of such contributions) could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, credit rating and cost of borrowing, financial position and/or results of operations. For example, following the completion of the triennial review of the U.K. pension plan with the plan's trustees in 2014, we made a GBP 150 million contribution to our U.K. pension plan in January 2015, based on the underfunded status of the plan and the evaluation of the plan's performance and long-term obligations.    We depend on key personnel, the loss of whom could harm our business.    The loss of the services and expertise of any key employee could harm our business. Our future success depends on our ability to identify, attract and retain qualified personnel on a timely basis. Turnover of senior management can adversely impact our stock price, our results of operations and our client relationships and may make recruiting for future management positions more difficult. In addition, we must successfully integrate any new management personnel that we hire within our organization, or who join our organization as a result of an acquisition, in order to achieve our operating objectives, and changes in other key management positions may temporarily affect our financial performance and results of operations as new management becomes familiar with our business.Due to a high concentration of workers represented by unions or trade councils in Canada, Europe, and at MillerCoors in the U.S., we could be significantly affected by labor strikes, work stoppages or other employee-related issues.    Approximately 50%, 28% and 36% of our Canadian, U.S. and European workforces, respectively, are represented by trade unions. Stringent labor laws in certain of our key markets expose us to a greater risk of loss should we experience labor disruptions in that market. A prolonged labor strike, work stoppage or other employee-related issue, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, early in the first quarter of 2017, our Toronto brewery unionized employees commenced a labor strike initiated from on-going negotiations of the collective bargaining agreement.  This labor strike has resulted in slower than expected production at the Toronto brewery early in the first quarter of 2017.Because of our reliance on third-party service providers and internal and outsourced systems for our information technology and certain other administrative functions, we could experience a disruption to our business.    We rely extensively on information services providers worldwide for our information technology functions including network, help desk, hardware and software configuration. Additionally, we rely on internal networks and information systems and other technology, including the internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement and supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments. We use information systems for certain human resource activities and to process our employee benefits, as well as to process financial information for internal and external reporting purposes and to comply with various reporting, legal and tax requirements. We also have outsourced a significant portion of work associated with our finance and accounting, human resources and other information technology functions to third-party service providers. As information systems are critical to many of our operating activities, our business may be impacted by system shutdowns, service disruptions or security breaches. Additionally, if one of our service providers was to fail and we were unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner, we could be unable to properly administer our outsourced functions. Further, our internal and outsourced systems may also be the target of a breach to our security, which, if successful, could expose us to the loss of key business, employee, customer or vendor information and disruption of our operations. If our information systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our remediation plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results and we may lose revenue and profits as a result of our inability to timely manufacture, distribute, invoice and collect payments from our customers. Misuse, leakage or falsification of information could result in a violation of data privacy laws and regulations, or damage our reputation and credibility. In addition, we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information and may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight or consumers may avoid our brands due to negative publicity. We could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems.If the Pentland Trust and the Coors Trust do not agree on a matter submitted to stockholders or if a super-majority of our board of directors do not agree on certain actions, generally the matter will not be approved, even if beneficial to us or favored by other stockholders or a majority of our board of directors.    Pentland Securities (1981) Inc. (the ""Pentland Trust"") (a company controlled by the Molson family and related parties) and the Adolph Coors, Jr. Trust (the ""Coors Trust""), which together control more than 90% of our Class A common stock and Class A exchangeable shares, have a voting trust agreement through which they have combined their voting power over the shares of our Class A common stock and the Class A exchangeable shares that they own. In the event that these two stockholders do not agree to vote in favor of a matter submitted to a stockholder vote (other than the election of directors), the voting trustees are required to vote all of the Class A common stock and Class A exchangeable shares deposited in the voting trust against the matter. There is no other mechanism in the voting trust agreement to resolve a potential deadlock between these stockholders. Therefore, if either the Pentland Trust or the Coors Trust is unwilling to vote in favor of a proposal that is subject to a stockholder vote, we would be unable to implement 25Table of Contentsthe proposal even if our board of directors, management or other stockholders believe the proposal is beneficial to us. Similarly, our bylaws require the authorization of a super-majority (two-thirds) of the board of directors to take certain transformational actions. Thus, it is possible that the Company will not be authorized to take action even if it is supported by a simple majority of the board of directors.    The interests of the controlling stockholders may differ from those of other stockholders and could prevent the Company from making certain decisions or taking certain actions that would be in the best interest of the other stockholders.    Our Class B common stock has fewer voting rights than our Class A common stock and holders of our Class A common stock have the ability to effectively control or have a significant influence over certain company actions requiring stockholder approval, which could have a material adverse effect on Class B stockholders. See Part II-Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 8, ""Stockholders' Equity"" of the Notes for additional information regarding voting rights of Class A and Class B stockholders.Risks Specific to the United States Segment    Our U.S. business is highly dependent on independent distributors to sell our products, with no assurance that these distributors will effectively sell our products.    We sell nearly all of our products, including all of our imported products, in the United States to independent distributors for resale to retail outlets. These independent distributors are entitled to exclusive territories and protected from termination by state statutes and regulations. Consequently, if we are not allowed or are unable to replace unproductive or inefficient distributors, our business, financial position and results of operation may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Competition in the U.S. market could have a material adverse impact on our U.S. business.    Craft breweries continue to expand in capacity, geographic and in their brand options while distributors and retailers are making more shelf space available for these expanding craft beer brands. With the continued growth of the craft industry in the U.S. market, we may not remain competitive and relevant with our product offerings and related innovations. An inability to remain competitive, could adversely impact our results of operations and market share. Additionally, due to competition with brewers and other alternative beverage companies in the U.S., an increase in the purchasing power of our large competitors, may cause further pricing pressures which could prevent us from increasing prices to recover higher costs necessary to compete. Such pressures, could have a material adverse impact our on our business and our financial results and market share.Changes in the social acceptability of alcohol and the political view of the alcohol industry may harm the U.S. business.    The alcoholic beverage industry is regularly the subject of anti-alcohol activist activity related to the health concerns from the misuse of alcohol and concerns regarding underage drinking and exposure to alcohol advertisements. Negative publicity regarding beer and changes in consumer perceptions in relation to beer and other alcoholic beverages, could adversely affect the sale and consumption of our products which could adversely affect our business and financial conditions. Additionally, the concerns around alcohol, could result in advertising, selling and other restrictions imposed by regulators. Moreover, it could result in increased taxes associated with alcohol sales, which could also negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition if consumers and customers change their purchasing patterns.Risks Specific to the Canada SegmentWe may experience adverse effects on our Canada business and financial results due to declines in the overall Canadian beer industry, continued price discounting, increased cost of goods sold and higher taxes.    If the Canadian beer market continues to decline, the impact to our financial results could be exacerbated due to our significant share of the overall market. Additionally, continuation, acceleration or the increase of price discounting, in Ontario, Québec, Alberta or other provinces, as well as increases in our cost of goods sold, could adversely impact our business. Further, changes in the Canadian tax legislation, such as the potential for an increase in beer excise taxes, could decrease our net sales. Moreover, the future success and earnings growth of the Canada business depends, in part, on our ability to efficiently conduct our operations. Failure to generate significant cost savings and margin improvement through our ongoing initiatives could adversely affect our profitability.    In the event that we are required to move away from the industry standard returnable bottle we use today, we may incur unexpected losses.    Along with ABI and other brewers in Canada, we currently use an industry standard returnable bottle which represents approximately 34% of total volume sales (excluding imports) in Canada. Changes to the Industry Standard Bottle Agreement could impact our use of the industry standard returnable bottle. If we cease to use the industry standard returnable bottle, our current bottle inventory and a portion of our bottle packaging equipment could become obsolete and could result in a material write-off of these assets.26Table of ContentsRisks Specific to the Europe SegmentThe vote in the U.K. to leave the European Union could adversely affect us. Approximately 22% of our consolidated net sales in 2016 came from the U.K., which is our largest market in Europe. In a referendum held on June 23, 2016, a majority of voters in the U.K. voted in favor of the U.K. leaving the European Union. The U.K. vote to leave the European Union triggered a decline in the GBP in comparison to USD and EUR. Weakening of economic conditions or economic uncertainties tend to harm the beer business, and if such conditions emerge in the U.K. or in the rest of Europe, it may have a material adverse effect on our Europe segment. In addition, any significant further weakening of the GBP to the USD will have an adverse impact on our European revenues as reported in USD due to the importance of U.K. sales. Negotiations on exit terms may take two years to complete once the U.K. formally initiates its exit from the European Union and negotiations on new trade agreements may take longer. The U.K. will remain a member of the European Union until then and will be bound by its legal and treaty obligations. Because of the uncertain terms of the exit, market volatility may continue.    Economic trends and intense competition in European markets could unfavorably affect our profitability.    Our European businesses have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by conditions in the global financial markets and general economic and political conditions, as well as a continued weakening of their respective currencies versus the U.S. dollar. Additionally, we face intense competition in certain of our European markets, particularly with respect to price, which could lead to reduced sales or profitability. In particular, the on-going focus by large competitors in Europe to drive increased market share through aggressive pricing strategies could adversely affect our sales and results of operations. In addition, in recent years, beer volume sales in Europe have been shifting from pubs and restaurants (on-premise) to retail stores (off-premise) as well as from premium or core brands to value brands, for the industry in general. Margins on sales of value brands and sales to off-premise customers tend to be lower than margins on sales to on-premise customers, and, as a result, continuation or acceleration of these trends would further adversely affect our profitability.Risks Specific to the Molson Coors International SegmentAn inability to expand our operations in emerging markets could adversely affect our growth prospects.    Our ability to grow our MCI segment in emerging markets depends on social, economic and political conditions in those markets, on our ability to create effective product distribution networks and consumer brand awareness in new markets and in many cases our ability to find appropriate local partners. Due to product price, local regulatory changes, local competition from competitors that are larger and have more resources than we do and cultural differences, or absence of effective routes to market, there is no assurance that our products will be accepted in any particular emerging market. If we are unable to expand our businesses in emerging markets, our growth prospects could be adversely affected.Risks Specific to Our Discontinued OperationsIndemnities provided to the purchaser of 83% of the Cervejarias Kaiser Brasil S.A. (""Kaiser"") business in Brazil could result in future cash outflows and statement of operations charges.    In 2006, we sold our 83% ownership interest in Kaiser to FEMSA Cerveza S.A. de C.V. (""FEMSA""). The terms of the sale agreement require us to indemnify FEMSA for exposures related to certain tax, civil and labor contingencies and certain purchased tax credits. The ultimate resolution of these claims is not under our control. These indemnity obligations are recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, however, we could incur future statement of operations charges as facts further develop resulting in changes to our estimates or changes in our assessment of probability of loss on these items as well as due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Due to the uncertainty involved in the ultimate outcome and timing of these contingencies, significant adjustments to the carrying value of our indemnity liabilities and corresponding statement of operations charges/credits could result in the future"
13,TAP,MOLSON COORS BREWING CO,2016-02-11,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORSThe reader should carefully consider the following risk factors and the other information contained within this document. The risks set forth below are those that management believes are most likely to have a material adverse effect on us. We may also be subject to other risks or uncertainties not presently known to us. If any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects.Risks Specific to the Pending AcquisitionWe cannot predict when or if the pending Acquisition will close.       The acquisition of the 58% equity interest and 50% voting interest of MillerCoors that we do not already own and the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico is contingent upon a number of conditions beyond our control, including the closing of the ABI-SABMiller Transaction. The closing of the ABI-SABMiller Transaction is subject to conditions beyond our control, including, among other things, receipt of international and U.S. regulatory approvals. The Acquisition will also require us to obtain regulatory approvals in the U.S. and 15Table of Contentscertain other jurisdictions. We are, therefore, unable to accurately predict when or if the pending Acquisition will close. If we are unable to close the Acquisition for any reason, we will not realize the potential benefits of the Acquisition, which may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects. We may not be able to realize anticipated cost synergies from the pending Acquisition.    The success of the pending Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize anticipated cost synergies. Our success in realizing these cost synergies, and the timing of this realization, depends on the successful integration of our business and operations with the acquired business and operations. Even if we are able to integrate the acquired businesses and operations successfully, this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the cost synergies of the pending Acquisition that we currently expect within the anticipated time frame or at all.The pending Acquisition will subject us to significant additional liabilities and other risks.    Following the pending Acquisition, we will be subject to substantially all the liabilities of MillerCoors, including, among others, significant pension liabilities. We will also be subject to the risks of the U.S. beer market to a much greater extent, and a significant majority of our overall business will be in mature, low growth beer markets, such as the U.S., Canada and the U.K. The pending Acquisition and subsequent integration process will be complex, costly, time-consuming and divert management’s time and attention, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We may be unable to obtain the regulatory approvals required to complete the pending Acquisition or, in order to do so, we may be required to satisfy material conditions or comply with material restrictions.      In addition to the international and U.S. regulatory approvals needed to close the ABI-SABMiller Transaction, the consummation of the pending Acquisition is also subject to review and approval by regulatory authorities, including by the United States Department of Justice. We can provide no assurance that all required regulatory approvals will be obtained in order to consummate the pending Acquisition. We have agreed to take all actions necessary, and assist and cooperate in doing all things necessary, to avoid or eliminate any legal impediments to the pending Acquisition, including divesting of up to $4 billion in assets. There can be no assurance as to the cost, scope or impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects of the actions that may be required to obtain regulatory approvals. Any such divestitures or other actions could have a material adverse effect on the business of both us and MillerCoors and substantially diminish the synergies and other advantages which we expect from the pending Acquisition. In addition, we may not be able to affect any divestitures at an acceptable price or at all. The pending Acquisition will impact our financial position.    We will need to raise significant capital to fund the pending Acquisition and such capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms. We expect to incur a substantial amount of additional indebtedness in connection with the pending Acquisition in addition to our Class B common stock offering completed in February 2016. If we are unable to raise significant additional capital on acceptable terms we may need to rely on our bridge loan agreement, which may result in substantially higher borrowing costs and a shorter maturity than those from other anticipated financing alternatives. In addition, ratings agencies may downgrade our credit ratings below their current investment grade levels as the results of additional indebtedness related to the pending Acquisition. A ratings downgrade could increase our costs of borrowing and harm our ability to finance the pending Acquisition on acceptable terms or refinance our debt in the future.As a result of the need to raise significant financing to fund the pending Acquisition, we currently intend to hold per share dividends constant and have suspended both our dividend target of 18% to 22% of trailing annualized EBITDA and our share repurchase program. We also intend to use cash from operations to fund the Acquisition and service and reduce our debt level, which will reduce funds available for other operational or strategic needs and may increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions.The incurrence of future indebtedness to fund the pending Acquisition may subject us to additional financial and operating restrictions.    Future indebtedness may subject us to additional financial and operating covenants, which may limit our flexibility in responding to our business needs. If we are not able to maintain compliance with stated financial covenants or if we breach other covenants in any debt agreement, we could be in default under such agreement. Such a default may allow our creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies.Our overall leverage and terms of our financing could, among other things:     •limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions;•make it more difficult to satisfy our obligations under the terms of our indebtedness;    •limit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all;    16Table of Contents•limit our flexibility to plan for and adjust to changing business and market conditions and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;    •require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to make interest and principal payments on our debt, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future acquisitions, working capital, business activities, and other general corporate requirements; and•limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, to fund growth or for general corporate purposes, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity, particularly if any ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward.    We face numerous risks associated with the pending Acquisition and integration of the Miller brand portfolio outside the U.S. and Puerto Rico.    The pending acquisition of the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico may subject us to unknown expenses and liabilities due to our limited due diligence of the business, including among other things, the absence of historical financial statements for this part of the business. The success of our acquisition of the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico will depend, in part, on our ability to realize all or some of the anticipated synergies and other benefits from integrating its business with our existing businesses and operations. The integration process may be complex, costly and time-consuming as the Miller brand portfolio assets are in over 50 foreign countries. The difficulties of integrating the operations include, among others:•failure to implement our business plan for the combined business; •unanticipated issues in integrating manufacturing, logistics, information, communications and other systems; •possible inconsistencies in standards, controls, contracts, procedures and policies;•impacts of change in control provisions in contracts and agreements;•failure to retain key customers and suppliers; •unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations; •failure to recruit and retain key employees to operate the combined business; •inherent operating risks in the business; •unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities; •unfamiliarity with operating in many of the countries in which the international Miller brand portfolio operates;•reliance on a competitor, ABI, to provide transition services for this business;•failure to develop sustainable routes to market upon the expiration of ABI’s transition services;•difficulty in fully separating the Miller brand portfolio from SABMiller’s current brand portfolio; and•inability to perform satisfactory due diligence on the business prior to closing of the Acquisition.    We may not be able to maintain the levels of revenue, earnings or operating efficiency that each of the Company and the international Miller brand portfolio had achieved or might achieve separately. Although we have a downward purchase price adjustment if the unaudited U.S. GAAP EBITDA for the international Miller brand portfolio for the four quarters prior to closing is below $70 million, such adjustment may not be adequate to protect us from the future harm of acquiring an underperforming or declining brand portfolio. In addition, we may not accomplish the integration of the international Miller brand portfolio smoothly, successfully or within the anticipated costs or timeframe. Moreover, the markets in which the international Miller brand portfolio operates may not experience the growth rates expected and any economic downturn affecting those markets could negatively impact the international Miller brand portfolio. These markets are in differing stages of development and may experience more volatility than expected or face more operating risks than in the more mature markets in which we have historically operated. If we experience difficulties with the integration process or if the international Miller brand portfolio or the markets in which it operates deteriorate, the potential cost savings, growth opportunities and other synergies of the acquisition of the Miller brand portfolio outside the U.S. and Puerto Rico may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. In such case, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively impacted.If we are unable to consummate the pending Acquisition, our stock price may be adversely affected and our financial condition may materially suffer.    If the pending Acquisition is not completed for any reason, the trading price of our Class A 17Table of Contentscommon stock or Class B common stock may decline to the extent that the market price of our Class A common stock or Class B common stock reflects positive market assumptions that the pending Acquisition will be completed and the related benefits will be realized. In addition, if the Acquisition is not completed our financial condition could materially suffer, including:•subject to certain reimbursement rights under the Purchase Agreement, the incurrence of significant costs related to the Acquisition without the associated benefits of completing the Acquisition, such as legal, accounting, filing, financial advisory, bridge and term loan financing and integration costs that have already been incurred or will continue up to the closing of the Acquisition. The amount of such operating expenses, fees and capital expenditures we incur in connection with the Acquisition will be based on a variety of factors but may be material;•increased dividend costs as a result additional capital stock issued without the associated benefits of completing the pending Acquisition;•if we complete a financing of debt securities prior to closing the pending Acquisition, the incurrence of significant interest expense and potential redemption premiums with respect to such debt securities without the associated benefits of completing the pending Acquisition; and•potential disruption to our business and distraction of our workforce and management team.We will incur substantial transaction fees and costs in connection with the pending Acquisition.    We expect to incur a significant amount of non-recurring expenses in connection with the pending Acquisition, including legal, accounting, financial advisory and other expenses. Subject to certain reimbursement rights under the Purchase Agreement, many of these expenses are payable by us whether or not the pending Acquisition is completed. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred following consummation of the pending Acquisition in the course of the integration of our businesses with that of MillerCoors and the international Miller brand portfolio. We cannot be certain that the elimination of duplicative costs or the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will offset the transaction and integration costs in the near term, or at all.The pending Acquisition will significantly increase our goodwill and other intangible assets.    We have a significant amount, and following the pending Acquisition will have an additional amount, of goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated financial statements that are subject to impairment based upon future adverse changes in our business or prospects. The impairment of any goodwill and other intangible assets may have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations. Risks Specific to Our CompanyThe global beer industry is constantly evolving, and our position within the global beer industry and our markets in which we operate may fundamentally change. If we do not successfully transform along with the evolving industry and market dynamics, then the result could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.   The brewing industry has significantly evolved over the years becoming an increasingly global beer market. For many years, the industry operated primarily on local presence with modest international expansion achieved through export, license and partnership arrangements, whereas it has now become increasingly complex as the consolidation of brewers has occurred globally resulting in fewer major global market participants. At the same time, smaller local brewers within certain geographies are seeing accelerated growth as consumers increasingly place value on locally-produced, regionally-sourced products. As a result of the increased global consolidation of brewers and the dynamic of an expanding new segment within the industry with new market entrants, the markets in which we operate, particularly the more mature markets, may evolve at a disadvantage to our current market position and local governments may intervene, which may fundamentally accelerate transformational changes to such markets. For example, U.S. and Canada beer markets have long consisted of a select number of significant market participants with government-regulated routes to market. However, recent evolution in these markets and emerging changes to consumer preferences have introduced a significant expansion of market entrants and resulted in increased consumer choice and market competition, as well as increased government scrutiny. Specifically, in Canada changes to the existing historical framework of regulations, distribution models, and packaging requirements, such as government-owned retail outlets and industry standard returnable bottles may be disadvantageous to us. Currently, in Ontario and other provinces, provincial governments are reviewing this historical foundation as a result of this market evolution and increased demand by some for government intervention to enhance competition and choice. As further described below, in addition to these risks related to growing competition and market evolution, the existing Ontario distribution models may be changed in ways that are unfavorable to us and the industry standard returnable bottle agreement may change in ways that adversely impact our operating model across Canada. If we are unsuccessful in evolving with, and navigating through, the changes to the markets in which we operate, the above risk could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.18Table of ContentsCompetition in our markets could require us to reduce prices or increase capital and other expenditures or cause us to lose sales volume, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    In most of our markets, our primary competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, production and distribution resources than we do, and are more diverse in terms of their geographies and brand portfolios. In all of the markets in which we operate, aggressive marketing strategies, such as reduced pricing, brand positioning, and increased capital investments by these competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, continuing consolidation among major global brewers may lead to stronger or new competitors, loss of partner brands, negative impacts on our distributor networks and predatory marketing and pricing tactics by competitors. Further, distributor consolidation could reduce our ability to promote our brands in the market in a manner that enhances rather than diminishes their value, as well as reducing our ability to manage our pricing effectively. These factors could result in lower margins or loss of market share, due to increased pressures for reduced pricing or difficulties in increasing prices while remaining competitive within our markets, as well as the need for increased capital investment, marketing and other expenditures. Moreover, several of our major markets are mature, so growth opportunities may be more limited to us than to our competitors. The above risk, if realized, could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Our success as an enterprise depends largely on the success of relatively few products in several mature markets specific to the beer industry; if consumer preferences shift away from our products or consumption of our products decline, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.    Our Coors Light and Molson Canadian brands in Canada, Coors Light and Miller Lite brands in the U.S., and Carling, Staropramen, Jelen, Ozujsko and Coors Light brands in Europe represented half of each respective segment's sales volumes in 2015. Additionally, several of our brands represent a significant share of their respective market, therefore volatility in these markets could disproportionately impact the performance of these brands. Consequently, any material shift in consumer preferences away from these brands, or from the categories in which they compete, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Consumer preferences and tastes may shift away from our brands or beer generally due to, among others, changing taste preferences, demographics, downturn in economic conditions or perceived value, as well as changes in consumers' perception of our brands due to negative publicity, regulatory actions or litigation. Additionally, in some of our major markets, specifically Canada and the U.S., there has been a recent shift in consumer preferences within the total beer market away from premium brands to ""craft beer"" produced by small, regional microbreweries, as well as a shift within the total alcohol beverage market from beer to wine and spirits. Moreover, several of our major markets are mature and we have significant share, therefore small movements in consumer preference can disproportionately impact our results. As a result, a shift in consumer preferences away from our products or beer could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Continued weak, or further weakening of, economic conditions in the markets in which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Beer consumption in many of our markets is closely tied to general economic conditions and a significant portion of our portfolio consists of premium and above premium brands. Difficult macroeconomic conditions in our markets, such as decreases in per capita income and level of disposable income driven by increases to inflation, income taxes, the cost of living, unemployment levels, political or economic instability or other country specific factors could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products. For example, we have continued to experience economic pressures in certain European markets through 2015, resulting in an increased consumer trend toward value brands within the impacted markets. This trend, along with other contributing factors, negatively impacted sales, as well as impairments of certain European brands, including Jelen, which were recorded in the third quarter of 2015. A continuation of this trend or further deterioration of the current economic conditions could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. We may incur impairments of the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets.    In connection with various business combinations, we have historically allocated material amounts of the related purchase prices to goodwill and other intangible assets that are considered to have indefinite useful lives. These assets are tested for impairment at least annually, using estimates and assumptions affected by factors such as economic and industry conditions and changes in operating performance. Additionally, in conjunction with the brand impairment tests, we also reassess each brand's indefinite-life classification. Potential resulting charges from an impairment of goodwill or brand intangible, as well as reclassification of an indefinite-lived to a definite-lived brand intangible, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, the results of our interim brand impairment review completed in the third quarter of 2015, indicated that the fair value of certain European indefinite-lived brand intangible assets were below their respective carrying values. As a result, we recorded an aggregate impairment charge of $275.0 million recorded within special items in our consolidated statements of operations during the third quarter of 2015. Additionally, during this review, we also reassessed each brand's indefinite-life classification and determined that these impaired brands have characteristics that have evolved which now indicate a definite-life is more appropriate. These brands have therefore been reclassified as definite-lived intangible assets to be amortized over useful lives ranging from 30 to 50 years. 19Table of ContentsOur most recent impairment analysis, conducted as of October 1, 2015, the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter, indicated that while our Canada reporting unit improved from the prior year, our Europe reporting unit declined and was determined to be at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test. Specifically, the fair value of the Europe and Canada reporting units were estimated at approximately 9% and 20% in excess of their carrying values, respectively. Additionally, the fair value of the Molson core brands in Canada, were also at risk of failing the quantitative analysis of the indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test as of October 1, 2015. The Europe reporting unit, and Molson core brands in Canada, are therefore at risk of a future impairment in the event of significant unfavorable changes in the forecasted cash flows (including prolonged, or further weakening of, adverse economic conditions or significant unfavorable changes in tax, environmental or other regulations, including interpretations thereof), terminal growth rates, market transaction multiples and/or weighted-average cost of capital utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis. Although the fair value in excess the of carrying value has increased for the Canada reporting unit from the October 1, 2014 testing date, the fair value is sensitive to potential unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows, macroeconomic conditions, market multiples or discount rates that could have an adverse impact. Any future impairment of the Europe or Canada reporting units or Molson or other brands, or reclassification of indefinite-lived brands to definite-lived, may result in material charges that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Additionally, the testing of our goodwill for impairment is predicated upon our determination of our reporting units. Any change to the conclusion of our reporting units or the aggregation of components within our reporting units could result in a different outcome to our annual impairment test. See Part II—Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Critical Accounting Estimates and Part II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 11, ""Goodwill and Intangible Assets"" of the Notes for additional information related to the results of our annual impairment testing.Termination of one or more manufacturer/distribution agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    We manufacture and/or distribute products of other beverage companies through various joint venture, licensing, distribution, contract brewing or other similar arrangements. The loss of one or more of these arrangements, as a result of industry consolidation or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, our 2015 Europe results were adversely impacted by the termination of our brewing and kegging agreement with Heineken under which we produced and packaged the Foster’s and Kronenbourg brands in the U.K. Additionally, Canada volumes were also adversely impacted by the termination of our license agreement with Miller Brewing Company (“Miller”) in 2015. Further, subsequent to ABI's acquisition of Grupo Modelo in 2013, we entered into an agreement to accelerate the termination of our MMI joint venture that imported, distributed and marketed the Modelo beer brand portfolio across all Canadian provinces and territories, which resulted in an adverse impact on our 2015 and 2014 Canadian volumes upon final termination in the first quarter of 2014. Changes in various supply chain standards or agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Our business includes various joint venture and industry agreements which standardize parts of the supply chain system. An example includes our warehousing and customer delivery systems organized under joint venture agreements with other brewers. Any negative change in these agreements or material terms within these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.We rely on a small number of suppliers to obtain the packaging materials we need to operate our business. The inability to obtain materials could unfavorably affect our ability to produce our products.    We purchase certain types of packaging materials including aluminum cans and bottles, glass bottles and paperboard from a small number of suppliers. Consolidation of packaging materials suppliers has reduced local supply alternatives and increased risks of supply disruptions. The inability of any of these suppliers to meet our production requirements without sufficient time to develop an alternative source could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Risks associated with operating our joint ventures may materially adversely affect our business and financial results.    We have entered into several joint ventures, including our MillerCoors joint venture in the United States and Puerto Rico with SABMiller. We may enter into additional joint ventures in the future. Our joint venture partners may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or with the goals of the joint venture. In addition, we compete against our joint venture partners in certain of our other markets. Disagreements with our business partners may impede our ability to maximize the benefits of our partnerships. Our joint venture arrangements may require us, among other matters, to pay certain costs or to make certain capital investments or to seek our joint venture partner's consent to take certain actions. In addition, our joint venture partners may be unable or unwilling to meet their economic or other obligations under the operative documents, and we may be required to either fulfill those obligations alone to ensure the ongoing success of a joint venture or to dissolve and liquidate a joint venture. For example, we terminated our MMI joint venture that imported, distributed and marketed the Modelo beer brand portfolio across all Canadian provinces and territories, which, since termination in the first quarter of 2014, has had an adverse effect on our Canadian volumes and financial results. The above risk, if realized, could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.20Table of ContentsOur operations in developing and emerging markets expose us to additional risks which could harm our business and financial results.    We expect our operations in developing and emerging markets to become more significant to our operating results as we continue to further expand internationally including in connection with our proposed acquisition of the Miller brand portfolio outside the U.S. and Puerto Rico. In certain of these markets, we have limited operating experience and may not succeed. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our operations in these markets expose us to additional risks, including: changes in local political, economic, social and labor conditions; restrictions on foreign ownership and investments; repatriation of cash earned in countries outside the U.S.; import and export requirements; increased costs to ensure compliance with complex foreign laws and regulations; currency exchange rate fluctuations; a less developed and less certain legal and regulatory environment, which among other things can create uncertainty with regard to liability issues; longer payment cycles, increased credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud; and other challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences.In addition, as a global company, we are subject to foreign and U.S. laws and regulations designed to combat governmental corruption, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and a materially negative effect on our brands and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, there can be no assurance that our employees, business partners or agents will not violate our policies.Changes to the regulation of the distribution systems for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results.    In our U.S. market, there is a three-tier distribution system that has historically applied to the distribution of products sold through MillerCoors (including our non-U.S. products). That system, consisting of required separation of manufacturers, distributors and retailers, is increasingly subject to legal challenges on the basis that it allegedly interferes with interstate commerce. To the extent that such challenges are successful and require changes to the three-tier system, such changes could have a materially adverse effect on MillerCoors and, consequently, on us. Further, in Canada, our products are required to be distributed through each province's respective provincial liquor board. Additionally, in certain provinces, we rely on our joint venture arrangements, such as BRI and BDL, to distribute our products via retail outlets that are mandated and regulated by provincial government regulators. BRI owns and operates commercial retail outlets, known as The Beer Store, in Ontario, and BDL facilitates the distribution of our products in the Western provinces. Recent review of government assets in Ontario has included an evaluation of the BRI distribution model which was finalized in second half of 2015. We continue to evaluate and are beginning to implement actions to mitigate any adverse impacts to our Canada segment that may result from these changes. See additional risks specific to BRI under the ""Risks Specific to the Canada Segment"" heading below. If provincial regulation should change, the costs to adjust our distribution methods could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Changes in tax, environmental or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing, trade and other regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Our business is highly regulated by federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in various jurisdictions regarding such matters as licensing requirements, trade and pricing practices, labeling, advertising, promotion and marketing practices, relationships with distributors, environmental matters, smoking bans at on-premise locations and other matters. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent re-evaluation, varying interpretations and political debate and inquiries from government regulators charged with their enforcement. Examples of this are the recent changes in the Canadian tax legislation and regulatory assessments received in Europe in the first quarter of 2015 and fourth quarter of 2014 related to the interpretation of the application of tax on the production and sale of our products. Failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or changes in these laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof, or in tax, environmental, excise tax levels imposed or any other laws or regulations could result in the loss, revocation or suspension of our licenses, permits or approvals and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, uncertainties exist with respect to adding new tax laws, the interpretation of, and potential future developments in, complex domestic and international tax laws and regulations and the amount and timing of future taxable income. Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded. Finally, advocates of prohibition and other severe restrictions on the marketing and sales of alcohol are becoming increasingly organized and coordinated on a global basis, seeking to impose laws or regulations or to bring actions against us, to curtail substantially the consumption of alcohol, including beer, in developed and developing markets. To the extent such views gain traction in regulations of jurisdictions in which we do or plan to do business, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2015, in Bihar, India, the largest state in India in which MCI operates, it was announced that regulatory changes could impact the sale and distribution of alcohol, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.21Table of ContentsOur consolidated financial statements are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, most significantly the Canadian dollar and the European operating currencies such as, but not limited to, Euro, British Pound, Czech Koruna, Croatian Kuna, Serbian Dinar, New Romanian Leu, Bulgarian Lev and Hungarian Forint.    We hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in different currencies, most significantly in Canada and throughout Europe. Because our financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars (""USD""), we must translate our assets, liabilities, income and expenses into USD. Increases and decreases in the value of the USD will affect, perhaps adversely, the value of these items in our financial statements, even if their local currency value has not changed. Additionally, we are exposed to currency transaction risks related to transactions denominated in currencies other than one of the functional currencies of our operating entities, such as the purchase of certain raw material inputs or capital expenditures, as well as sales transactions and debt issuances or other incurred obligations. Further, certain actions by the government of any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our results and financial position. To the extent that we fail to adequately manage these risks through our risk management policies intended to protect our exposure to currency movements, which may affect our operations, including if our hedging arrangements do not effectively or completely hedge changes in foreign currency rates, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, the recent strengthening of the USD against the Canadian dollar, European currencies and various other global currencies, if continued, would adversely impact our USD reported results due to the impact on foreign currency translation. Our operations face significant exposure to changes in commodity prices, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.    We use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials, some of which are purchased through supply contracts with third parties, to produce our products, including barley, malted barley, hops, corn, other various starches, water and packaging materials, including aluminum cans and bottles, glass and polyethylene terephthalate (“PET”) containers, as well as, cardboard and other paper products. We also use a significant amount of diesel fuel, natural gas and electricity in our operations. The supply and price of these raw materials and commodities can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including market demand, alternative sources for suppliers, global geopolitical events (especially as to their impact on crude oil prices and the resulting impact on diesel fuel prices), frosts, droughts and other weather conditions, economic factors affecting growth decisions, inflation, plant diseases and theft. To the extent any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of ingredients or packaging or our hedging arrangements do not effectively or completely hedge changes in commodity price risks and we are not able to pass these increased costs along to customers, our financial results could be materially adversely impacted.Climate change and water availability may negatively affect our business and financial results.    There is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures could cause significant changes in global weather patterns and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. While warmer weather has historically been associated with increased sales of beer, changing weather patterns could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions which may limit availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities, such as hops, barley and other cereal grains, which are important ingredients for our products. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. In addition, public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. Clean water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and climate change may increase water scarcity and cause a deterioration of water quality in areas where we maintain brewing operations. The competition for water among domestic, agricultural and manufacturing users is increasing in some of our brewing communities. Even where water is widely available, water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain our operations. The above risks, if realized, could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Loss or closure of a major brewery or other key facility, due to unforeseen or catastrophic events or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Our business and financial results could be materially adversely impacted by physical risks such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, other natural disasters or catastrophic events that damage or destroy one of our breweries or key facilities or the key facilities of our significant suppliers. Additionally, certain catastrophes are not covered by our general insurance policies, which could result in significant unrecoverable losses. In addition, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted by under-investment in physical assets or production capacity, including contract brewing and effect on priority of our brands if production capacity is limited. Further, significant excess capacity at any of our breweries as a result of increased efficiencies in our supply chain process or continued volume declines, could result in under-utilization of our assets, which could lead to excess overhead expenses or additional costs incurred associated with the closure of one or more of our facilities. For example, as part of a strategic review of our supply chain network, certain breweries and bottling lines were closed during 2015 in which we incurred costs during the year and for which we may incur additional costs during 2016. There may be further brewery closures as part of our ongoing assessment to ensure that our supply chain capacity is aligned with the needs of the business. 22Table of ContentsFailure to successfully identify, complete or integrate attractive acquisitions and joint ventures into our existing operations could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.    We have made a number of acquisitions and entered into several joint ventures. In order to compete in the consolidating global brewing industry, we anticipate that we may, from time to time, in the future acquire additional businesses or enter into additional joint ventures that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our business such as the pending Acquisition. See above ""Risks Specific to the Pending Acquisition"" for further details. Potential risks associated with acquisitions and joint ventures could include, among other things: our ability to identify attractive acquisitions and joint ventures; our ability to offer potential acquisition targets and joint venture partners' competitive transaction terms; our ability to raise capital on reasonable terms to finance attractive acquisitions and joint ventures; our ability to realize the benefits or cost savings that we expect to realize as a result of the acquisition or joint venture; diversion of management's attention; our ability to successfully integrate our businesses with the business of the acquired company; motivating, recruiting and retaining key employees; conforming standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures among our company and the acquired company; consolidating and streamlining sales, marketing and corporate operations; potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies; loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business; and managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations following completion of an acquisition or entry into a joint venture. If an acquisition or joint venture is not successfully completed or integrated into our existing operations, our business and financial results could be materially adversely impacted.Poor investment performance of pension plan holdings and other factors impacting pension plan costs could unfavorably affect our business, liquidity and our financial results.    Our costs of providing defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on the plans' assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, exchange rate fluctuations, future government regulation, global equity prices, and our required and/or voluntary contributions to the plans. While we comply with the minimum funding requirements, we have certain qualified pension plans with obligations which exceed the value of the plans' assets. These funding requirements may also require contributions even when there is no reported deficit. Without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans' assets, and depending upon the other factors as listed above, we could be required to fund the plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations (or the timing of such contributions) could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, credit rating and cost of borrowing, financial position and/or results of operations. For example, following the completion of the triennial review of the U.K. pension plan with the plan's trustees in 2014, we made a GBP 150 million contribution to our U.K. pension plan in January 2015, based on the underfunded status of the plan and the evaluation of the plan's performance and long-term obligations.Failure to comply with our debt covenants or a deterioration in our credit rating could have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain future financing at competitive rates and/or our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness.   Under the terms of each of our debt facilities, we must comply with certain restrictions. These include restrictions on priority indebtedness (certain threshold percentages of secured consolidated net tangible assets), leverage thresholds, liens, and restrictions on certain types of sale lease-back transactions and transfers of assets. Failure to comply with these restrictions or maintain our credit rating may result in issues with our current financing structure and potential future financing requirements. A deterioration in our credit rating could also affect our ability to obtain future financing or refinance our current debt, as well as increase our borrowing rates, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.We depend on key personnel, the loss of whom would harm our business.    The loss of the services and expertise of any key employee could harm our business. Our future success depends on our ability to identify, attract and retain qualified personnel on a timely basis. Turnover of senior management can adversely impact our stock price, our results of operations and our client relationships and may make recruiting for future management positions more difficult. In addition, we must successfully integrate any new management personnel that we hire within our organization, or who join our organization as a result of an acquisition, in order to achieve our operating objectives, and changes in other key management positions may temporarily affect our financial performance and results of operations as new management becomes familiar with our business. Due to a high concentration of workers represented by unions or trade councils in Canada, Europe, and at MillerCoors in the U.S., we could be significantly affected by labor strikes, work stoppages or other employee-related issues.    Approximately 59%, 31% and 36% of our Canadian, MillerCoors and European workforces, respectively, are represented by trade unions. Stringent labor laws in the U.K. expose us to a greater risk of loss should we experience labor disruptions in that market. A labor strike, work stoppage or other employee-related issue could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.The success of our business relies heavily on brand image, reputation, product quality and protection of intellectual property.    It is important that we maintain and increase the image and reputation of our existing products. Concerns about product quality, even when unsubstantiated, could be harmful to our image and reputation of our products. Deterioration to our brand equity may be difficult to combat or reverse and could have a material effect on our business and financial results. In 23Table of Contentsaddition, because our brands carry family names, personal activities by certain members of the Molson or Coors families that harm their public image or reputation could have an adverse effect on our brands. Further, the success of our Company is dependent on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, including trademarks, patents, domain names, trade secrets and know-how. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be sufficient or that third parties will not infringe upon or misappropriate these rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Because of our reliance on third-party service providers and internal and outsourced systems for our information technology and certain other administrative functions, we could experience a disruption to our business.    We rely exclusively on information services providers worldwide for our information technology functions including network, help desk, hardware and software configuration. Additionally, we rely on internal networks and information systems and other technology, including the internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement and supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments. We use information systems for certain human resource activities and to process our employee benefits, as well as to process financial information for internal and external reporting purposes and to comply with various reporting, legal and tax requirements. We also have outsourced a significant portion of work associated with our finance and accounting, human resources and other information technology functions to third-party service providers. As information systems are critical to many of our operating activities, our business may be impacted by system shutdowns, service disruptions or security breaches. Additionally, if one of our service providers was to fail and we were unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner, we could be unable to properly administer our outsourced functions. Further, our internal and outsourced systems may also be the target of a breach to our security, which, if successful, could expose us to the loss of key business, employee, customer or vendor information and disruption of our operations. If our information systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our remediation plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results and we may lose revenue and profits as a result of our inability to timely manufacture, distribute, invoice and collect payments from our customers. Misuse, leakage or falsification of information could result in a violation of data privacy laws and regulations, damage our reputation and credibility. In addition, we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information and may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight. We could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems.If the Pentland Trust and the Coors Trust do not agree on a matter submitted to stockholders or if a super-majority of our board of directors do not agree on certain actions, generally the matter will not be approved, even if beneficial to us or favored by other stockholders or a majority of our board of directors.    Pentland Securities (1981) Inc. (the ""Pentland Trust"") (a company controlled by the Molson family and related parties) and the Adolph Coors, Jr. Trust (the ""Coors Trust""), which together control more than 90% of our Class A common stock and Class A exchangeable shares, have a voting trust agreement through which they have combined their voting power over the shares of our Class A common stock and the Class A exchangeable shares that they own. In the event that these two stockholders do not agree to vote in favor of a matter submitted to a stockholder vote (other than the election of directors), the voting trustees are required to vote all of the Class A common stock and Class A exchangeable shares deposited in the voting trust against the matter. There is no other mechanism in the voting trust agreement to resolve a potential deadlock between these stockholders. Therefore, if either the Pentland Trust or the Coors Trust is unwilling to vote in favor of a proposal that is subject to a stockholder vote, we would be unable to implement the proposal even if our board of directors, management or other stockholders believe the proposal is beneficial to us. Similarly, our bylaws require the authorization of a super-majority (two-thirds) of the board of directors to take certain transformational actions. Thus, it is possible that the Company will not be authorized to take action even if it is supported by a simple majority of the board of directors. The interests of the controlling stockholders may differ from those of other stockholders and could prevent the Company from making certain decisions or taking certain actions that would be in the best interest of the other stockholders.    Our Class B common stock has fewer voting rights than our Class A common stock and holders of our Class A common stock have the ability to effectively control or have a significant influence over certain company actions requiring stockholder approval, which could have a material adverse effect on Class B stockholders. See Part II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 8, ""Stockholders' Equity"" of the Notes for additional information regarding voting rights of Class A and Class B stockholders.Risks Specific to the Canada SegmentGovernment mandated changes to the retail distribution model resulting from new regulations may have a material adverse effect on our Canada business.    Beer sales are highly regulated by the Canadian government. For example, in Ontario, off-premise beer may only be purchased at retail outlets operated by BRI, government-regulated retail outlets operated by the Liquor Control Board of Ontario (""LCBO""), or approved agents of the LCBO. In April 2014, the Ontario Premier's 24Table of ContentsAdvisory Council on Government Assets (the ""Council"") began a review that included evaluating the beer retailing and distribution system in Ontario, for which BRI is the primary beer retail and distribution channel. In April 2015, as a result of this review and our negotiations with the Council, we, along with the other owners of BRI, agreed, in principle and subject to entry into definitive binding documents, to enter into a new beer framework agreement (the ""New Framework"") with the Province of Ontario. The associated Master Framework Agreement was subsequently executed by all parties on September 22, 2015, and became effective as of January 1, 2016. Additionally, as a result of the above review, certain other legal matters could arise that could have a negative impact on our business, such as the litigation related to our ownership of BRI discussed in Part I—Item 3. Legal Proceedings. If the implementation of the provisions under the New Framework differ from our current expectations, it could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. We may experience adverse effects on our Canada business and financial results due to declines in the overall Canadian beer industry, continued price discounting, increased cost of goods sold and higher taxes.    If the Canadian beer market continues to decline, the impact to our financial results could be exacerbated due to our significant share of the overall market. Additionally, continuation, acceleration or the increase of price discounting, in Ontario, Québec, Alberta or other provinces, as well as increases in our cost of goods sold, could adversely impact our business. Further, changes in the Canadian tax legislation, such as the recent increase in beer excise taxes and the implementation of equalization and standardization of excise tax regulations in Quebec, could decrease our net sales. Moreover, the future success and earnings growth of the Canada business depends, in part, on our ability to efficiently conduct our operations. Failure to generate significant cost savings and margin improvement through our ongoing initiatives could adversely affect our profitability.In the event that we are required to move away from the industry standard returnable bottle we use today, we may incur unexpected losses.    Along with ABI and other brewers in Canada, we currently use an industry standard returnable bottle which represents approximately 37% of total volume sales (excluding imports) in Canada. Changes to the Industry Standard Bottle Agreement could impact our use of the industry standard returnable bottle. If we cease to use the industry standard returnable bottle, our current bottle inventory and a portion of our bottle packaging equipment could become obsolete and could result in a material write-off of these assets.Risks Specific to the United States Segment and MillerCoorsWe do not fully control the operations and administration of MillerCoors, which represents our interests in the U.S. beer business.    Pending our proposed Acquisition of 100% of MillerCoors, we jointly control MillerCoors with SABMiller and hold a 42% economic interest in the joint venture. While we direct the MillerCoors business through our equal representation on its board of directors (along with SABMiller) and otherwise impact its business activities through our ongoing communication and oversight, MillerCoors’ management is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the business. As a result, we do not have full control over MillerCoors’ activities. Our results of operations are dependent upon the efforts of MillerCoors' management, our ability to govern the joint venture effectively with SABMiller and factors beyond our control that may affect SABMiller. For example, the loss of the services and expertise of any key MillerCoors employee could harm our business. Additionally, our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to MillerCoors are necessarily substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. Certain rights of first refusal apply to any assignment of the joint venture interests. Any transfer of ownership interest could have a significant effect on our results of operations and financial position, as well as our ongoing internal and external business relationships. See risk factors related to the pending Acquisition of MillerCoors above. MillerCoors is highly dependent on independent distributors in the United States to sell its products, with no assurance that these distributors will effectively sell its and our products.    MillerCoors sells all of its products and many of our non-U.S. products in the United States to distributors for resale to retail outlets and the regulatory environment of many states makes it very difficult to change distributors. Consequently, if MillerCoors is not allowed or is unable to replace unproductive or inefficient distributors, its business, financial position and results of operation may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Risks Specific to the Europe SegmentEconomic trends and intense competition in European markets could unfavorably affect our profitability.    Our European businesses have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by conditions in the global financial markets and general economic and political conditions, as well as a continued weakening of their respective currencies versus the U.S. dollar. Our interim brand impairment review completed in the third quarter of 2015, indicated that the fair value of certain European indefinite-lived brand intangible assets were below their respective carrying values and we therefore recorded an aggregate impairment charge of $275.0 million. Additionally, during this review, we also reassessed each brand's indefinite-life classification and determined that these impaired brands have characteristics that have evolved which now indicate a definite-life is more appropriate. These brands have therefore been reclassified as definite-lived intangible assets to be amortized over useful lives ranging from 30 to 50 years. The decline in fair value of these brands was due, in part, to key changes to our 25Table of Contentsunderlying assumptions supporting the value of the brands. Specific changes include underperformance through the 2015 peak season driving a downward shift in management's forecasts, along with challenging macroeconomic and competitive conditions that we no longer expect to subside in the near term. Additionally, we face intense competition in certain of our European markets, particularly with respect to price, which could lead to reduced sales or profitability. In particular, the on-going focus by large competitors in Europe to drive increased market share through aggressive pricing strategies could adversely affect our sales and results of operations. In addition, in recent years, beer volume sales in Europe have been shifting from pubs and restaurants (on-premise) to retail stores (off-premise), for the industry in general. Margins on sales to off-premise customers tend to be lower than margins on sales to on-premise customers, and, as a result, continuation or acceleration of these trends would further adversely affect our profitability.In the event that a significant pub chain declared bankruptcy, or experience similar financial difficulties, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.    We extend credit to pub chains in the U.K., and in some cases the amounts are significant. Business at on-premise outlets has decreased since late 2008 as a result of a continued challenging economic environment in the U.K. While the economic environment in the U.K. has seen an upturn in 2015, some pub chains may continue to face increasing financial difficulty, if economic conditions do not stabilize. In the event that one or more significant pub chains were to be unable to pay amounts owed to us as a result of bankruptcy or similar financial difficulties, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. Risks Specific to the Molson Coors International SegmentAn inability to expand our operations in emerging markets could adversely affect our growth prospects.    Our ability to grow our MCI segment in emerging markets depends on social, economic and political conditions in those markets, on our ability to create effective product distribution networks and consumer brand awareness in new markets and in many cases our ability to find appropriate local partners. Due to product price, local regulatory changes, local competition from competitors that are larger and have more resources than we do and cultural differences, or absence of effective routes to market, there is no assurance that our products will be accepted in any particular emerging market. If we are unable to expand our businesses in emerging markets, our growth prospects could be adversely affected.Risks Specific to Our Discontinued OperationsIndemnities provided to the purchaser of 83% of the Cervejarias Kaiser Brasil S.A. (""Kaiser"") business in Brazil could result in future cash outflows and statement of operations charges.    In 2006, we sold our 83% ownership interest in Kaiser to FEMSA Cerveza S.A. de C.V. (""FEMSA""). The terms of the sale agreement require us to indemnify FEMSA for exposures related to certain tax, civil and labor contingencies and certain purchased tax credits. The ultimate resolution of these claims is not under our control. These indemnity obligations are recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, however, we could incur future statement of operations charges as facts further develop resulting in changes to our estimates or changes in our assessment of probability of loss on these items as well as due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Due to the uncertainty involved in the ultimate outcome and timing of these contingencies, significant adjustments to the carrying value of our indemnity liabilities and corresponding statement of operations charges/credits could result in the future"
6,TAP,MOLSON COORS BREWING CO,2015-02-12,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORSThe reader should carefully consider the following risk factors and the other information contained within this document. The risks set forth below are those that management believes are most likely to have a material adverse effect on us. We may also be subject to other risks or uncertainties not presently known to us. If any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects.Risks Specific to Our CompanyThe global beer industry is constantly evolving, and our position within the global beer industry and our markets in which we operate may fundamentally change. If we do not successfully transform along with the evolving industry and market dynamics, then the result could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.   The brewing industry has significantly evolved over the years becoming an increasingly global beer market. For many years, the industry operated primarily on local presence with modest international expansion achieved through export, license and partnership arrangements, whereas it has now become increasingly complex as the consolidation of brewers has occurred globally resulting in fewer major global market participants. At the same time, smaller local brewers within certain geographies are seeing accelerated growth as consumers increasingly place value on locally-produced, regionally-sourced products. As a result of the increased global consolidation of brewers and the dynamic of an expanding new segment within the industry with new market entrants, the markets in which we operate, particularly the more mature markets, may evolve at a disadvantage to our current market position and local governments may intervene, which may fundamentally accelerate transformational changes to such markets. For example, U.S. and Canada beer markets have long consisted of a select number of significant market participants with government-regulated routes to market. However, recent evolution in these markets and emerging changes to consumer preferences have introduced a significant expansion of market entrants and resulted in increased consumer choice and market competition, as well as increased government scrutiny. Specifically, in Canada changes to the existing historical framework of regulations, distribution models, and packaging requirements, such as government-owned retail outlets and industry standard returnable bottles may be disadvantageous to us. Currently, in Ontario and other provinces, provincial governments are reviewing this historical foundation as a result of this market evolution and increased demand by some for government intervention to enhance competition and choice. As further described below, in addition to these risks related to growing competition and market evolution, the existing Ontario distribution models may be changed in ways that are unfavorable to us and the industry standard returnable bottle agreement may change in ways that adversely impact our operating model across Canada. If we are unsuccessful in evolving with, and navigating through, the changes to the markets in which we operate, the above risk could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Competition in our markets could require us to reduce prices or increase capital and other expenditures or cause us to lose sales volume, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    In most of our markets, our primary competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, production and distribution resources than we do, and are more diverse in terms of their geographies and brand portfolios. In all of the markets in which we operate, aggressive marketing strategies, such as reduced pricing, brand positioning, and increased capital investments by these competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, continuing consolidation among major global brewers may lead to stronger or new competitors, loss of partner brands, negative impacts on our distributor networks and predatory marketing and pricing tactics by competitors. Further, distributor consolidation could reduce our ability to promote our brands in the market in a manner that enhances rather than diminishes their value, as well as reducing 15Table of Contentsour ability to manage our pricing effectively. These factors could result in lower margins or loss of market share, due to increased pressures for reduced pricing or difficulties in increasing prices while remaining competitive within our markets, as well as the need for increased capital investment, marketing and other expenditures. Moreover, several of our major markets are mature, so growth opportunities may be more limited to us than to our competitors. The above risk, if realized, could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Our success as an enterprise depends largely on the success of relatively few products in several mature markets specific to the beer industry; if consumer preferences shift away from our products or consumption of our products decline, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.    Our Coors Light and Molson Canadian brands in Canada, Coors Light and Miller Lite brands in the U.S., and Carling, Jelen, Ozujsko and Staropramen brands in Europe represented half of each respective segment's sales volumes in 2014. Additionally, several of our brands represent a significant share of their respective market, therefore volatility in these markets could disproportionately impact the performance of these brands. Consequently, any material shift in consumer preferences away from these brands, or from the categories in which they compete, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Consumer preferences and tastes may shift away from our brands or beer generally due to, among others, changing taste preferences, demographics, downturn in economic conditions or perceived value, as well as changes in consumers' perception of our brands due to negative publicity, regulatory actions or litigation. Additionally, in some of our major markets, specifically Canada and the U.S., there has been a recent shift in consumer preferences within the total beer market away from premium brands to ""craft beer"" produced by small, regional microbreweries, as well as a shift within the total alcohol beverage market from beer to wine and spirits. Moreover, several of our major markets are mature and we have significant share, therefore small movements in consumer preference can disproportionately impact our results. As a result, a shift in consumer preferences away from our products or beer could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Continued weak, or further weakening of, economic conditions in the markets in which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Beer consumption in many of our markets is closely tied to general economic conditions and a significant portion of our portfolio consists of premium and above premium brands. Difficult macroeconomic conditions in our markets, such as decreases in per capita income and level of disposable income driven by increases to inflation, income taxes, the cost of living, unemployment levels, political or economic instability or other country specific factors could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products. For example, during the second quarter of 2014, the Balkans region experienced significant flooding which further exacerbated the existing economic pressures in the area, resulting in an increased consumer trend toward value brands within the impacted markets. This trend, along with other contributing factors, led to a decrease in sales volumes in the region, as well as impairments of our Jelen brand in Serbia and Ozujsko brand in Croatia, which were recorded in the third quarter of 2014. A continuation of this trend or further deterioration of the current economic conditions could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. We may incur impairments of the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets.    In connection with various business combinations, we have historically allocated material amounts of the related purchase prices to goodwill and other intangible assets that are considered to have indefinite useful lives. These assets are tested for impairment at least annually, using estimates and assumptions affected by factors such as economic and industry conditions and changes in operating performance. Additionally, in conjunction with the brand impairment tests, we also reassess each brand's indefinite-life classification. Potential resulting charges from an impairment of goodwill or brand intangible, as well as reclassification of an indefinite-lived to a definite-lived brand intangible, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, the results of our initial 2014 indefinite-lived intangible asset testing performed as of July 1, 2014, indicated that the fair value of our Jelen and Ozujsko indefinite-lived brand intangible assets within our Europe segment were below their respective carrying values. As a result, we recorded an aggregate impairment charge of $360.0 million recorded within special items in our consolidated statements of operations during the third quarter of 2014. Our most recent impairment analysis, conducted as of October 1, 2014, the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter, indicated that the fair value of our Europe and Canada reporting units were at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test. The fair value of the Europe and Canada reporting units were estimated at approximately 14% and 11% in excess of their carrying values, respectively. Additionally, the fair value of the Jelen, Ozujsko and Niksicko indefinite-lived brands in Europe, and the Molson core brands in Canada, were also at risk of failing the quantitative analysis of the indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test as of October 1, 2014. The Europe and Canada reporting units, and the Jelen, Ozujsko and Niksicko brands in Europe and Molson core brands in Canada, are therefore at risk of a future impairment in the event of significant unfavorable changes in the forecasted cash flows (including significant delays in projected macroeconomic recovery or prolonged adverse economic conditions), terminal growth rates, market transaction multiples and/or weighted-average cost of capital utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis. Any future impairment of the Europe or Canada reporting units or Jelen, Ozujsko, Niksicko, Molson or other brands, or reclassification of indefinite-lived brands to definite-lived, may result in material charges that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Additionally, the testing of our goodwill for impairment is predicated upon our determination of our reporting units. Any change to the conclusion of our reporting units or the 16Table of Contentsaggregation of components within our reporting units could result in a different outcome to our annual impairment test. See Part II—Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Critical Accounting Estimates and Part II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 12, ""Goodwill and Intangible Assets"" of the Notes for additional information related to the results of our annual impairment testing.Termination of one or more manufacturer/distribution agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    We manufacture and/or distribute products of other beverage companies through various joint venture, licensing, distribution, contract brewing or other similar arrangements. The loss of one or more of these arrangements, as a result of industry consolidation or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, during 2014 we entered into an agreement with Miller Brewing Company (“Miller”) to terminate the license agreement between Miller and MCC, which, when consummated in 2015, will have an adverse effect on our Canadian volumes. Additionally, subsequent to ABI's acquisition of Grupo Modelo in 2013, we entered into an agreement to accelerate the termination of our MMI joint venture that imports, distributes and markets the Modelo beer brand portfolio across all Canadian provinces and territories, which resulted in an adverse impact on our 2014 Canadian volumes upon final termination in the first quarter of 2014. Changes in various supply chain standards or agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Our business includes various joint venture and industry agreements which standardize parts of the supply chain system. An example includes our warehousing and customer delivery systems organized under joint venture agreements with other brewers. Any negative change in these agreements or material terms within these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.We rely on a small number of suppliers to obtain the packaging materials we need to operate our business. The inability to obtain materials could unfavorably affect our ability to produce our products.    We purchase certain types of packaging materials including aluminum cans and bottles, glass bottles and paperboard from a small number of suppliers. Consolidation of packaging materials suppliers has reduced local supply alternatives and increased risks of supply disruptions. The inability of any of these suppliers to meet our production requirements without sufficient time to develop an alternative source could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Risks associated with operating our joint ventures may materially adversely affect our business and financial results.    We have entered into several joint ventures, including our MillerCoors joint venture in the United States and Puerto Rico with SABMiller. We may enter into additional joint ventures in the future. Our joint venture partners may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or with the goals of the joint venture. In addition, we compete against our joint venture partners in certain of our other markets. Disagreements with our business partners may impede our ability to maximize the benefits of our partnerships. Our joint venture arrangements may require us, among other matters, to pay certain costs or to make certain capital investments or to seek our joint venture partner's consent to take certain actions. In addition, our joint venture partners may be unable or unwilling to meet their economic or other obligations under the operative documents, and we may be required to either fulfill those obligations alone to ensure the ongoing success of a joint venture or to dissolve and liquidate a joint venture. For example, we terminated our MMI joint venture that imported, distributed and marketed the Modelo beer brand portfolio across all Canadian provinces and territories, which, since termination in the first quarter of 2014, has had an adverse effect on our Canadian volumes and financial results. The above risk, if realized, could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Our operations in developing and emerging markets expose us to additional risks which could harm our business and financial results.    We expect our operations in developing and emerging markets to become more significant to our operating results as we continue to further expand internationally. In certain of these markets, we have limited operating experience and may not succeed. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our operations in these markets expose us to additional risks, including: changes in local political, economic, social and labor conditions; restrictions on foreign ownership and investments; repatriation of cash earned in countries outside the U.S.; import and export requirements; increased costs to ensure compliance with complex foreign laws and regulations; currency exchange rate fluctuations; a less developed and less certain legal and regulatory environment, which among other things can create uncertainty with regard to liability issues; longer payment cycles, increased credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud; and other challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences.In addition, as a global company, we are subject to foreign and U.S. laws and regulations designed to combat governmental corruption, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and a materially negative effect on our brands and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, there can be no assurance that our employees, business partners or agents will not violate our policies.17Table of ContentsChanges to the regulation of the distribution systems for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results.    In our U.S. market, there is a three-tier distribution system that has historically applied to the distribution of products sold through MillerCoors (including our non-U.S. products). That system, consisting of required separation of manufacturers, distributors and retailers, is increasingly subject to legal challenges on the basis that it allegedly interferes with interstate commerce. To the extent that such challenges are successful and require changes to the three-tier system, such changes could have a materially adverse effect on MillerCoors and, consequently, on us. Further, in Canada, our products are required to be distributed through each province's respective provincial liquor board. Additionally, in certain provinces, we rely on our joint venture arrangements, such as BRI and BDL, to distribute our products via retail outlets that are mandated and regulated by provincial government regulators. BRI owns and operates commercial retail outlets, known as The Beer Store, in Ontario, and BDL facilitates the distribution of our products in the Western provinces. Recent review of government assets in Ontario has included an evaluation of the BRI distribution model, the results of which we are actively negotiating with the Ontario government. We cannot predict what, if any, changes may result from this review and what the impact may be on us; however, changes to the BRI distribution model could have a material adverse effect on BRI. See additional risks specific to BRI under the ""Risks Specific to the Canada Segment"" heading below. If provincial regulation should change, the costs to adjust our distribution methods could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Changes in tax, environmental or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing, trade and other regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Our business is highly regulated by federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in various jurisdictions regarding such matters as licensing requirements, trade and pricing practices, labeling, advertising, promotion and marketing practices, relationships with distributors, environmental matters, smoking bans at on-premise locations and other matters. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent re-evaluation, varying interpretations and political debate and inquiries from government regulators charged with their enforcement. Examples of this are the recent changes in the Canadian tax legislation and a regulatory assessment received in Europe in the fourth quarter of 2014 related to the interpretation of the application of tax on the production and sale of our products. Failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or changes in these laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof, or in tax, environmental, excise tax levels imposed or any other laws or regulations could result in the loss, revocation or suspension of our licenses, permits or approvals and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, uncertainties exist with respect to adding new tax laws, the interpretation of, and potential future developments in, complex domestic and international tax laws and regulations and the amount and timing of future taxable income. Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded. Finally, advocates of prohibition and other severe restrictions on the marketing and sales of alcohol are becoming increasingly organized and coordinated on a global basis, seeking to impose laws or regulations or to bring actions against us, to curtail substantially the consumption of alcohol, including beer, in developed and developing markets. To the extent such views gain traction in regulations of jurisdictions in which we do or plan to do business, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Our consolidated financial statements are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, most significantly the Canadian dollar and the European operating currencies such as, but not limited to, Euro, British Pound, Czech Koruna, Croatian Kuna, Serbian Dinar, New Romanian Leu, Bulgarian Lev and Hungarian Forint.    We hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in different currencies, most significantly in Canada and throughout Europe. Because our financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars (""USD""), we must translate our assets, liabilities, income and expenses into USD. Increases and decreases in the value of the USD will affect, perhaps adversely, the value of these items in our financial statements, even if their local currency value has not changed. Additionally, we are exposed to currency transaction risks related to transactions denominated in currencies other than one of the functional currencies of our operating entities, such as the purchase of certain raw material inputs or capital expenditures, as well as sales transactions and debt issuances or other incurred obligations. Further, certain actions by the government of any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our results and financial position. To the extent that we fail to adequately manage these risks through our risk management policies intended to protect our exposure to currency movements, which may affect our operations, including if our hedging arrangements do not effectively or completely hedge changes in foreign currency rates, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, the recent strengthening of the USD against the Canadian dollar, European currencies and various other global currencies, if continued, would adversely impact our USD reported results due to the impact on foreign currency translation. Our operations face significant exposure to changes in commodity prices, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.    We use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials, some of which are purchased through supply contracts with third parties, to produce our products, including barley, malted barley, hops, corn, other various starches, water and packaging materials, including aluminum cans and bottles, glass and polyethylene terephthalate (“PET”) containers, as well as, cardboard and other paper products. We also use a significant amount of diesel 18Table of Contentsfuel, natural gas and electricity in our operations. The supply and price of these raw materials and commodities can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including market demand, alternative sources for suppliers, global geopolitical events (especially as to their impact on crude oil prices and the resulting impact on diesel fuel prices), frosts, droughts and other weather conditions, economic factors affecting growth decisions, inflation, plant diseases and theft. To the extent any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of ingredients or packaging or our hedging arrangements do not effectively or completely hedge changes in commodity price risks and we are not able to pass these increased costs along to customers, our financial results could be materially adversely impacted.Climate change and water availability may negatively affect our business and financial results.    There is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures could cause significant changes in global weather patterns and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. While warmer weather has historically been associated with increased sales of beer, changing weather patterns could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions which may limit availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities, such as hops, barley and other cereal grains, which are important ingredients for our products. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. In addition, public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. Clean water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and climate change may increase water scarcity and cause a deterioration of water quality in areas where we maintain brewing operations. The competition for water among domestic, agricultural and manufacturing users is increasing in some of our brewing communities. Even where water is widely available, water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain our operations. The above risk, if realized, could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Loss or closure of a major brewery or other key facility, due to unforeseen or catastrophic events or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Our business and financial results could be materially adversely impacted by physical risks such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, other natural disasters or catastrophic events that damage or destroy one of our breweries or key facilities or the key facilities of our significant suppliers. Additionally, certain catastrophes are not covered by our general insurance policies, which could result in significant unrecoverable losses. In addition, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted by under-investment in physical assets or production capacity, including contract brewing and effect on priority of our brands if production capacity is limited. Further, significant excess capacity at any of our breweries as a result of increased efficiencies in our supply chain process or continued volume declines, could result in under-utilization of our assets, which could lead to excess overhead expenses or additional costs incurred associated with the closure of one or more of our facilities. For example, as part of a strategic review of our European supply chain network and following receipt of notification of the termination of our distribution agreement with Heineken in the U.K., management made a proposal to close our brewing facility in Alton, Hampshire, U.K. in 2015, in connection with which we incurred costs in the fourth quarter of 2014 and for which we may incur additional costs during the first half of 2015. Failure to successfully identify, complete or integrate attractive acquisitions and joint ventures into our existing operations could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.    We have made a number of acquisitions and entered into several joint ventures. In order to compete in the consolidating global brewing industry, we anticipate that we may, from time to time, in the future acquire additional businesses or enter into additional joint ventures that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our business. Potential risks associated with acquisitions and joint ventures could include, among other things: our ability to identify attractive acquisitions and joint ventures; our ability to offer potential acquisition targets and joint venture partners' competitive transaction terms; our ability to realize the benefits or cost savings that we expect to realize as a result of the acquisition or joint venture; diversion of management's attention; our ability to successfully integrate our businesses with the business of the acquired company; motivating, recruiting and retaining key employees; conforming standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures among our company and the acquired company; consolidating and streamlining sales, marketing and corporate operations; potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies; loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business; and managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations following completion of an acquisition or entry into a joint venture. If an acquisition or joint venture is not successfully completed or integrated into our existing operations, our business and financial results could be materially adversely impacted.Poor investment performance of pension plan holdings and other factors impacting pension plan costs could unfavorably affect our business, liquidity and our financial results.    Our costs of providing defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on the plans' assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, exchange rate fluctuations, future government regulation, global equity prices, and our required and/or voluntary contributions to the plans. While we comply with the minimum funding requirements, we have certain qualified pension plans with obligations which exceed the value of the plans' assets. These 19Table of Contentsfunding requirements may also require contributions even when there is no reported deficit. Without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans' assets, and depending upon the other factors as listed above, we could be required to fund the plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations (or the timing of such contributions) could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, credit rating and cost of borrowing, financial position and/or results of operations. For example, following the completion of the triennial review of the U.K. pension plan with the plan's trustees in 2014, we agreed to make a GBP 150 million contribution to our U.K. pension plan in 2015, which we paid in January 2015, based on the underfunded status of the plan and the evaluation of the plan's performance and long-term obligations.Failure to comply with our debt covenants or a deterioration in our credit rating could have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain future financing at competitive rates and/or our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness.   Under the terms of each of our debt facilities, we must comply with certain restrictions. These include restrictions on priority indebtedness (certain threshold percentages of secured consolidated net tangible assets), leverage thresholds, liens, and restrictions on certain types of sale lease-back transactions and transfers of assets. Failure to comply with these restrictions or maintain our credit rating may result in issues with our current financing structure and potential future financing requirements. A deterioration in our credit rating could also affect our ability to obtain future financing or refinance our current debt, as well as increase our borrowing rates, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.We depend on key personnel, the loss of whom would harm our business.    The loss of the services and expertise of any key employee could harm our business. Our future success depends on our ability to identify, attract and retain qualified personnel on a timely basis. Turnover of senior management can adversely impact our stock price, our results of operations and our client relationships and may make recruiting for future management positions more difficult. In addition, we must successfully integrate any new management personnel that we hire within our organization, or who join our organization as a result of an acquisition, in order to achieve our operating objectives, and changes in other key management positions may temporarily affect our financial performance and results of operations as new management becomes familiar with our business. Due to a high concentration of workers represented by unions or trade councils in Canada, Europe, and at MillerCoors in the U.S., we could be significantly affected by labor strikes, work stoppages or other employee-related issues.    Approximately 65%, 36% and 39% of our Canadian, MillerCoors and European workforces, respectively, are represented by trade unions. Stringent labor laws in the U.K. expose us to a greater risk of loss should we experience labor disruptions in that market. A labor strike, work stoppage or other employee-related issue could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.The success of our business relies heavily on brand image, reputation, product quality and protection of intellectual property.    It is important that we maintain and increase the image and reputation of our existing products. Concerns about product quality, even when unsubstantiated, could be harmful to our image and reputation of our products. Deterioration to our brand equity may be difficult to combat or reverse and could have a material effect on our business and financial results. In addition, because our brands carry family names, personal activities by certain members of the Molson or Coors families that harm their public image or reputation could have an adverse effect on our brands. Further, the success of our Company is dependent on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, including trademarks, patents, domain names, trade secrets and know-how. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be sufficient or that third parties will not infringe upon or misappropriate these rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Because of our reliance on third-party service providers and internal and outsourced systems for our information technology and certain other administrative functions, we could experience a disruption to our business.    We rely exclusively on information services providers worldwide for our information technology functions including network, help desk, hardware and software configuration. Additionally, we rely on internal networks and information systems and other technology, including the internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement and supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments. We use information systems for certain human resource activities and to process our employee benefits, as well as to process financial information for internal and external reporting purposes and to comply with various reporting, legal and tax requirements. We also have outsourced a significant portion of work associated with our finance and accounting, human resources and other information technology functions to third-party service providers. As information systems are critical to many of our operating activities, our business may be impacted by system shutdowns, service disruptions or security breaches. Additionally, if one of our service providers was to fail and we were unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner, we could be unable to properly administer our outsourced functions. Further, our internal and outsourced systems may also be the target of a breach to our security, which, if successful, could expose us to the loss of key business, employee, customer or vendor information and disruption of our operations. If our information systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our remediation plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results and 20Table of Contentswe may lose revenue and profits as a result of our inability to timely manufacture, distribute, invoice and collect payments from our customers. Misuse, leakage or falsification of information could result in a violation of data privacy laws and regulations, damage our reputation and credibility. In addition, we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information and may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight. We could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems.If the Pentland Trust and the Coors Trust do not agree on a matter submitted to stockholders, generally the matter will not be approved, even if beneficial to us or favored by other stockholders.    Pentland Securities (1981) Inc. (the ""Pentland Trust"") (a company controlled by the Molson family and related parties) and the Adolph Coors, Jr. Trust (the ""Coors Trust""), which together control more than 90% of our Class A common stock and Class A exchangeable shares, have a voting trust agreement through which they have combined their voting power over the shares of our Class A common stock and the Class A exchangeable shares that they own. In the event that these two stockholders do not agree to vote in favor of a matter submitted to a stockholder vote (other than the election of directors), the voting trustees are required to vote all of the Class A common stock and Class A exchangeable shares deposited in the voting trust against the matter. There is no other mechanism in the voting trust agreement to resolve a potential deadlock between these stockholders. Therefore, if either the Pentland Trust or the Coors Trust is unwilling to vote in favor of a proposal that is subject to a stockholder vote, we would be unable to implement the proposal even if our board of directors, management or other stockholders believe the proposal is beneficial to us. Similarly, our bylaws require the authorization of a super-majority (two-thirds) of the board of directors to take certain transformational actions. Thus, it is possible that the Company will not be authorized to take action even if it is supported by a simple majority of the board of directors. The interests of the controlling stockholders may differ from those of other stockholders and could prevent the Company from making certain decisions or taking certain actions that would be in the best interest of the other stockholders.    Our Class B common stock has fewer voting rights than our Class A common stock and holders of our Class A common stock have the ability to effectively control or have a significant influence over certain company actions requiring stockholder approval, which could have a material adverse effect on Class B stockholders. See Part II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 9, ""Stockholders' Equity"" of the Notes for additional information regarding voting rights of Class A and Class B stockholders.Risks Specific to the Canada SegmentGovernment mandated changes to the retail distribution model resulting from new regulations may have a material adverse effect on our Canada business.    Beer sales are highly regulated by the Canadian government. For example, in Ontario, off-premise beer may only be purchased at retail outlets operated by BRI, government-regulated retail outlets operated by the Liquor Control Board of Ontario (""LCBO""), or approved agents of the LCBO. In April 2014, the Ontario Premier's Advisory Council on Government Assets (the ""Council"") began a review that included evaluating the BRI distribution model. The results of this review and related proposals are currently under active discussions with the Council, and the ultimate consequences related to this negotiation are unknown at this time. For example, the government could introduce a material operating fee, in the form of a mandated specific tax or other assessment, to allow BRI the right to continue to distribute in Ontario. It could also introduce incremental packaging options at the LCBO and agents of the LCBO, or otherwise mandate changes to the current retail distribution model, which could result in decreased off-premise sales volumes through BRI and negatively impact our position in the market. Additionally, as a result of the above review, certain other legal matters could arise that could have a negative impact on our business, such as the litigation related to our ownership of BRI discussed in Part I—Item 3. Legal Proceedings. The above risk, if realized, could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. We may experience adverse effects on our Canada business and financial results due to declines in the overall Canadian beer industry, continued price discounting, increased cost of goods sold and higher taxes.    If the Canadian beer market continues to decline, the impact to our financial results could be exacerbated due to our significant share of the overall market. Additionally, continuation, acceleration or the increase of price discounting, in Ontario, Québec, Alberta or other provinces, as well as increases in our cost of goods sold, could adversely impact our business. Further, changes in the Canadian tax legislation, such as the recent increase in beer excise taxes and the implementation of equalization and standardization of excise tax regulations in Quebec, could decrease our net sales. Moreover, the future success and earnings growth of the Canada business depends, in part, on our ability to efficiently conduct our operations. Failure to generate significant cost savings and margin improvement through our ongoing initiatives could adversely affect our profitability.In the event that we are required to move away from the industry standard returnable bottle we use today, we may incur unexpected losses.    Along with ABI and other brewers in Canada, we currently use an industry standard returnable bottle which represents approximately 40% of total volume sales (excluding imports) in Canada. Changes to the Industry Standard Bottle Agreement could impact our use of the industry standard returnable bottle. If we cease to use the industry 21Table of Contentsstandard returnable bottle, our current bottle inventory and a portion of our bottle packaging equipment could become obsolete and could result in a material write-off of these assets.Risks Specific to the United States Segment and MillerCoorsWe do not fully control the operations and administration of MillerCoors, which represents our interests in the U.S. beer business.    We jointly control MillerCoors with SABMiller and hold a 42% economic interest in the joint venture. While we direct the MillerCoors business through our equal representation on its board of directors (along with SABMiller) and otherwise impact its business activities through our ongoing communication and oversight, MillerCoors’ management is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the business. As a result, we do not have full control over MillerCoors’ activities. Our results of operations are dependent upon the efforts of MillerCoors management, our ability to govern the joint venture effectively with SABMiller and factors beyond our control that may affect SABMiller. For example, the loss of the services and expertise of any key MillerCoors employee could harm our business. Additionally, our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to MillerCoors are necessarily substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. Certain rights of first refusal apply to any assignment of the joint venture interests. Any transfer of ownership interest could have a significant effect on our results of operations and financial position, as well as our ongoing internal and external business relationships.MillerCoors is highly dependent on independent distributors in the United States to sell its products, with no assurance that these distributors will effectively sell its and our products.    MillerCoors sells all of its products and many of our non-U.S. products in the United States to distributors for resale to retail outlets and the regulatory environment of many states makes it very difficult to change distributors. Consequently, if MillerCoors is not allowed or is unable to replace unproductive or inefficient distributors, its business, financial position and results of operation may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Risks Specific to the Europe SegmentEconomic trends and intense competition in European markets could unfavorably affect our profitability.    Our European businesses have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by conditions in the global financial markets and general economic and political conditions, as well as a continued weakening of their respective currencies versus the U.S. dollar. As a result of our annual impairment testing, we determined that the fair value of our Jelen and Ozujsko indefinite-lived brand intangible assets were below their respective carrying values as of July 1, 2014. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge in the third quarter of 2014. The decline in fair value of these brands was due, in part, to the continued weakening of the macroeconomic environment in certain European markets, which was further exacerbated by significant flooding that occurred in the Balkans region during the second quarter of 2014. This also drove an acceleration of the trend toward value brands in certain markets where our primary brands are considered premium or above-premium. Our impairment testing also indicated risk of additional future impairments of Jelen, Ozujsko and Niksicko indefinite-lived intangible brands sold in these markets. Additionally, we face intense competition in certain of our European markets, particularly with respect to price, which could lead to reduced sales or profitability. In particular, the on-going focus by large competitors in Europe to drive increased market share through aggressive pricing strategies could adversely affect our sales and results of operations. In addition, in recent years, beer volume sales in Europe have been shifting from pubs and restaurants (on-premise) to retail stores (off-premise), for the industry in general. Margins on sales to off-premise customers tend to be lower than margins on sales to on-premise customers, and, as a result, continuation or acceleration of these trends would further adversely affect our profitability.In the event that a significant pub chain declared bankruptcy, or experience similar financial difficulties, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.    We extend credit to pub chains in the U.K., and in some cases the amounts are significant. The continuing challenging economic environment in the U.K. has caused business at on-premise outlets to decrease since late 2008, and some pub chains may face increasing financial difficulty, if economic conditions do not improve. In the event that one or more significant pub chains were to be unable to pay amounts owed to us as a result of bankruptcy or similar financial difficulties, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. Risks Specific to the Molson Coors International SegmentAn inability to expand our operations in emerging markets could adversely affect our growth prospects.    Our ability to grow our MCI segment in emerging markets depends on social, economic and political conditions in those markets, on our ability to create effective product distribution networks and consumer brand awareness in new markets and in many cases our ability to find appropriate local partners. Due to product price, local competition from competitors that are larger and have more resources than we do and cultural differences, or absence of effective routes to market, there is no assurance that our products will be accepted in any particular emerging market. If we are unable to expand our businesses in emerging markets, our growth prospects could be adversely affected.22Table of ContentsRisks Specific to Our Discontinued OperationsIndemnities provided to the purchaser of 83% of the Cervejarias Kaiser Brasil S.A. (""Kaiser"") business in Brazil could result in future cash outflows and statement of operations charges.    In 2006, we sold our 83% ownership interest in Kaiser to FEMSA Cerveza S.A. de C.V. (""FEMSA""). The terms of the sale agreement require us to indemnify FEMSA for exposures related to certain tax, civil and labor contingencies and certain purchased tax credits. The ultimate resolution of these claims is not under our control. These indemnity obligations are recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, however, we could incur future statement of operations charges as facts further develop resulting in changes to our estimates or changes in our assessment of probability of loss on these items as well as due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Due to the uncertainty involved in the ultimate outcome and timing of these contingencies, significant adjustments to the carrying value of our indemnity liabilities and corresponding statement of operations charges/credits could result in the future"
3,TAP,MOLSON COORS BREWING CO,2014-02-14,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORSThe reader should carefully consider the following risk factors and the other information contained within this document. The risks set forth below are those that management believes are most likely to have a material adverse effect on us. We may also be subject to other risks or uncertainties not presently known to us. If any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects.Risks Specific to Our CompanyCompetition in our markets could require us to reduce prices or increase capital and other expenditures or cause us to lose sales volume, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    In most of our markets, our primary competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, production and distribution resources than we do, and are more diverse in terms of their geographies and brand portfolios. In all of the markets in which we operate, aggressive marketing strategies, such as reduced pricing, brand positioning, and increased capital investments by these competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, continuing consolidation among major global brewers may lead to stronger or new competitors, loss of partner brands, negative impacts on our distributor networks and predatory marketing and pricing tactics by competitors. Further, distributor consolidation could have a long-term material adverse effect on our business by diminishing our ability to promote our brands in the market in a manner that enhances rather than diminishes their value, as well as reducing our ability to manage our pricing effectively, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. These factors could result in lower margins or loss of market share, due to increased pressures for reduced pricing or difficulties in increasing prices while remaining competitive 13Table of Contentswithin our markets, as well as the need for increased capital investment, marketing and other expenditures. Moreover, several of our major markets are mature, so growth opportunities may be more limited to us than to our competitors. Our success as an enterprise depends largely on the success of relatively few products in several mature markets specific to the beer industry; if consumer preferences shift away from our products or consumption of our products decline, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.    Our Molson Canadian and Coors Light brands in Canada, Miller Lite and Coors Light brands in the U.S., and Carling, Jelen, Staropramen, and Ozujsko brands in Europe represented more than half of each respective segment's sales in 2013. Additionally, several of our brands represent a significant share of their respective market, therefore volatility in these markets could disproportionately impact the performance of these brands. Consequently, any material shift in consumer preferences away from these brands, or from the categories in which they compete, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Consumer preferences and tastes may shift away from our brands or beer generally due to, among others, changing taste preferences, demographics, downturn in economic conditions or perceived value, as well as changes in consumers' perception of our brands due to negative publicity, regulatory actions or litigation. Additionally, in our major markets there has been a recent shift in consumer preferences within the total beer market away from premium brands to ""craft beer"" produced by small, regional microbreweries, as well as a shift within the total alcohol market from beer to wine and spirits. Moreover, several of our major markets are mature and we have significant share, therefore small movements in consumer preference can disproportionately impact our results. As a result, a shift in consumer preferences away from our products could result in a material adverse impact on our business and financial results.Continued weak, or further weakening of, economic conditions in the markets in which we do business could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results.    Beer consumption in many of our markets is closely tied to general economic conditions and a significant portion of our brand portfolio consists of premium and above premium brands. Difficult macroeconomic conditions in our markets, such as decrease in per capita income and level of disposable income driven by increases to inflation, income taxes, the cost of living, unemployment levels, political or economic instability or other country specific factors could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products.If the Pentland Trust and the Coors Trust do not agree on a matter submitted to stockholders, generally the matter will not be approved, even if beneficial to us or favored by other stockholders.    Pentland Securities (1981) Inc. (the ""Pentland Trust"") (a company controlled by the Molson family and related parties) and the Adolph Coors, Jr. Trust (the ""Coors Trust""), which together control more than ninety percent of our Class A common stock and Class A exchangeable shares, have voting trust agreements through which they have combined their voting power over the shares of our Class A common stock and the Class A exchangeable shares that they own. In the event that these two stockholders do not agree to vote in favor of a matter submitted to a stockholder vote (other than the election of directors), the voting trustees are required to vote all of the Class A common stock and Class A exchangeable shares deposited in the voting trusts against the matter. There is no other mechanism in the voting trust agreements to resolve a potential deadlock between these stockholders. Therefore, if either the Pentland Trust or the Coors Trust is unwilling to vote in favor of a proposal that is subject to a stockholder vote, we would be unable to implement the proposal even if our board of directors, management or other stockholders believe the proposal is beneficial to us. Similarly, our bylaws require the authorization of a super-majority (two-thirds) of the board of directors to take certain transformational actions. Thus it is possible that the Company will not be authorized to take action even if it is supported by a simple majority of the board of directors. The interests of the controlling stockholders may differ from those of other stockholders and could prevent the Company from making certain decisions or taking certain actions that would be in the best interest of the other stockholders.    Our Class B common stock has fewer voting rights than our Class A common stock and holders of our Class A common stock have the ability to effectively control or have a significant influence over certain company actions requiring stockholder approval, which could have a material adverse impact on Class B stockholders. Poor investment performance of pension plan holdings and other factors impacting pension plan costs could unfavorably impact our business, liquidity and our financial results.    Our costs of providing defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on the plans' assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, exchange rate fluctuations, future government regulation, global equity prices, and our required and/or voluntary contributions to the plans. While we comply with the minimum funding requirements, we have certain qualified pension plans with obligations which exceed the value of the plans' assets. These funding requirements may also require contributions even when there is no reported deficit. Without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans' assets, and depending upon the other factors as listed above, we could be required to fund the plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows, credit rating and cost of borrowing, financial position and/or results of operations.We rely on a small number of suppliers to obtain the packaging we need to operate our business. The inability to obtain materials could unfavorably affect our ability to produce our products.    We purchase certain types of packaging 14Table of Contentsmaterials including aluminum cans and bottles, glass bottles and paperboard from a small number of suppliers. Consolidation of the packaging materials suppliers has reduced local supply alternatives and increased risks of supply disruptions. The inability of any of these suppliers to meet our production requirements without sufficient time to develop an alternative source could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Termination of one or more manufacturer/distribution agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    We manufacture and/or distribute products of other beverage companies through various joint ventures, licensing, distribution, contract brewing or other arrangements. The loss of one or more of these arrangements, as a result of industry consolidation or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, subsequent to ABI's acquisition of Grupo Modelo, we entered into an agreement to accelerate the termination of our MMI joint venture that imports, distributes and markets the Modelo beer brand portfolio across all Canadian provinces and territories, which, when consummated, will have an adverse impact on our Canadian volumes. Additionally, Miller Brewing Company (“Miller”) has notified us of its intent to terminate the license agreement between Miller and us in Canada, which, if the termination is upheld or the parties fail to resolve the dispute through negotiation, could have an adverse impact on our Canadian volumes. Further, Tradeteam exclusively handles all of the physical distribution for our products in the U.K., except where a different distribution system is requested by a customer. If Tradeteam were unable to continue distribution of our products and we were unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner, we could experience significant disruptions in our U.K. operations that could have an adverse financial impact to our business and financial results.Changes in tax, environmental or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing, trade and other regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Our business is highly regulated by federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in various countries regarding such matters as licensing requirements, trade and pricing practices, labeling, advertising, promotion and marketing practices, relationships with distributors, environmental matters, smoking bans at on-premise locations and other matters. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent re-evaluation, varying interpretations and political debate and inquiries from government regulators charged with their enforcement. Examples of this are the recent changes in the Canadian tax legislation and U.K. statutory tax rate increases. Failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or changes in these laws and regulations or in tax, environmental, excise tax levels imposed or any other laws or regulations could result in the loss, revocation or suspension of our licenses, permits or approvals and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations and the amount and timing of future taxable income. Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded. Finally, advocates of prohibition and other severe restrictions on the marketing and sales of alcohol are becoming increasingly organized on a global basis, seeking to impose regulations or to bring actions against us, to curtail substantially the consumption of alcohol, including beer, in developed and developing markets. To the extent such views gain traction in regulations where we do or plan to do business, they could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results.Our consolidated financial statements are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, most significantly the Canadian dollar and the European operating currencies such as, but not limited to, British Pound, Euro, Czech Koruna, Croatian Kuna, Serbian Dinar, New Romanian Leu, Bulgarian Lev and Hungarian Forint.    We hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in different currencies, most significantly in Canada and throughout Europe. Because our financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars (""USD""), we must translate our assets, liabilities, income and expenses into USD. Increases and decreases in the value of the USD will affect, perhaps adversely, the value of these items in our financial statements, even if their local currency value has not changed. Additionally, we are exposed to currency transaction risks related to transactions denominated in currencies other than one of the functional currencies of our operating entities, such as the purchase of certain raw material inputs or capital expenditures, as well as sales transactions and debt issuances or other incurred obligations. Further, certain actions by the government of any of the countries in which we operate could adversely affect our results and financial position. To the extent that we fail to adequately manage these risks through our risk management policies intended to protect our exposure to currency movements, including if our hedging arrangements do not effectively or completely hedge changes in foreign currency rates, our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted.Our operations face significant exposure to changes in commodity prices, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.    We use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials, some of which are purchased through supply contracts with third parties, to produce our products, including barley, malted barley, hops, corn, other various starches, water and packaging materials, including aluminum cans and bottles, glass and polyethylene terephthalate (“PET”) containers,  as well as, cardboard and other paper products. We also use a significant amount of diesel fuel, natural gas and electricity in our operations. The supply and price of these raw materials and commodities can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including market demand, alternative sources for suppliers, global geopolitical 15Table of Contentsevents (especially as to their impact on crude oil prices and the resulting impact on diesel fuel prices), frosts, droughts and other weather conditions, economic factors affecting growth decisions, inflation, plant diseases and theft. To the extent any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of ingredients or packaging or our hedging arrangements do not effectively or completely hedge changes in commodity price risks and we are not able to pass these increased costs along to customers, our financial results could be materially adversely impacted.The success of our business relies heavily on brand image, reputation, product quality and protection of intellectual property.    It is important that we maintain and increase the image and reputation of our existing products. Concerns about product quality, even when unsubstantiated, could be harmful to our image and reputation of our products. Deterioration to our brand equity may be difficult to combat or reverse and could have a material effect on our business and financial results. In addition, because our brands carry family names, personal activities by certain members of the Molson or Coors families that harm their public image or reputation could have an adverse effect on our brands. Further, the success of our Company is dependent on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, including trademarks, patents, domain names, trade secrets and know-how. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be sufficient or that third parties will not infringe upon or misappropriate these rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Due to a high concentration of unionized workers in Canada, the United Kingdom, and at MillerCoors in the U.S., we could be significantly affected by labor strikes, work stoppages or other employee-related issues.    Approximately 60%, 36% and 26% of our Canadian, MillerCoors and U.K. workforces, respectively, are represented by trade unions. In addition, a number of our Central European employees are represented by trade councils. Stringent labor laws in the U.K. expose us to a greater risk of loss should we experience labor disruptions in that market. A labor strike, work stoppage or other employee-related issue could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Changes to the regulation of the distribution systems for our products could adversely impact our business and financial results.    In our U.S. market, there is a three-tier distribution system that has historically applied to the distribution of products sold through MillerCoors (including our non-U.S. products). That system is increasingly subject to the legal challenges on the basis that it allegedly interferes with interstate commerce. To the extent that such challenges are successful and require changes to the three-tier system, such changes could have a materially adverse impact on MillerCoors and, consequently, MCBC. Further, in Canada, our products are required to be distributed through each province's respective provincial liquor board. Additionally, in certain provinces, we rely on our joint venture arrangements, such as BRI in Ontario and BDL in the Western provinces, to distribute our products via retail outlets that are mandated and regulated by provincial government regulators. If provincial regulation should change, the costs to adjust our distribution methods could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results.Changes in various supply chain standards or agreements could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results.    Our business includes various joint venture and industry agreements which standardize parts of the supply chain system. An example includes our warehousing and customer delivery systems organized under joint venture agreements with other brewers. Any negative change in these agreements could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results.Because of our reliance on third-party service providers and internal and outsourced systems for our information technology and certain other administrative functions, we could experience a disruption to our business.    We rely exclusively on information services providers worldwide for our information technology functions including network, help desk, hardware and software configuration. We also have outsourced a significant portion of work associated with our finance and accounting, human resources and other information technology functions to third-party service providers. If one of these service providers was to fail and we were unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner, we could be unable to properly administer our outsourced functions. Additionally, our internal and outsourced systems may also be the target of outside parties attempting to breach our security, which, if successful, could expose us to the loss of key business or employee information and disruption of our operations.We may incur impairments of the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets.    In connection with various business combinations, we have allocated material amounts of the related purchase prices to goodwill and other intangible assets that are considered to have indefinite useful lives. These assets are tested for impairment at least annually, using estimates and assumptions affected by factors such as economic and industry conditions and changes in operating performance. Additionally, in conjunction with the brand impairment tests, we also reassess each brand's indefinite-life classification. Potential resulting charges from an impairment of goodwill or brand intangible, as well as reclassification of an indefinite-lived to a definite-lived brand intangible, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Our most recent impairment analysis, conducted as of June 30, 2013, the first day of our third quarter, indicated that the fair value of our Europe and Canada reporting units were close to failing step one of the goodwill impairment test. The fair value of the Europe and Canada reporting units were estimated at approximately 11% and 16% in excess of their carrying values, respectively. In 16Table of Contentsaddition, we determined that the fair value of our Jelen and Ostravar indefinite-lived brand intangible assets within our Europe segment were below their respective carrying values as of June 30, 2013. As a result, we recorded an aggregate impairment charge of $150.9 million recorded within special items in our consolidated statements of operations during the third quarter of 2013. The aggregate fair value of the Jelen, Ozujsko and Branik indefinite-lived brands in Europe, at the valuation date, was estimated at approximately 1% in excess of the aggregate carrying value. Further, the fair value of the Molson core brands was estimated at approximately 10% in excess of its carrying value. The Europe and Canada reporting units, and the Jelen, Ozujsko and Branik brands in Europe and Molson core brands in Canada, are therefore at risk of a future impairment in the event of significant unfavorable changes in the forecasted cash flows (including significant delays in projected macroeconomic recovery or prolonged adverse economic conditions), terminal growth rates, market transaction multiples and/or weighted-average cost of capital utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis. We have also identified risks related to the possible termination of our license agreement with Miller in Canada, which resulted in an impairment of our related definite-lived intangible asset during the fourth quarter 2013. Additionally, the results of our annual testing determined that the indefinite-life classification could no longer be supported for the Ostravar brand. The Ostravar brand has therefore been reclassified as a definite-lived intangible asset and the remaining fair value of the asset will be amortized over its estimated remaining life. Any future impairment of the Jelen, Ozujsko, Branik, Molson or other brands, or reclassification of additional brands from indefinite-lived to definite-lived, may result in material charges that could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results.Climate change and water availability may negatively affect our business and financial results.    There is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures could cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. While warmer weather has historically been associated with increased sales of beer, changing weather patterns could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions which may limit availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities, such as hops, barley and other cereal grains, which are important ingredients for our products. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. In addition, public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term, material adverse impact on our business and financial results. Clean water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and climate change may increase water scarcity and cause a deterioration of water quality in areas where we maintain brewing operations. The competition for water among domestic, agricultural and manufacturing users is increasing in some of our brewing communities. Even where water is widely available, water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain our operations.Failure to successfully identify, complete or integrate attractive acquisitions and joint ventures into our existing operations could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.    We have made a number of acquisitions and entered into several joint ventures. In order to compete in the consolidating global brewing industry, we anticipate that we may, from time to time, in the future acquire additional businesses or enter into additional joint ventures that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our business. Potential issues associated with acquisitions and joint ventures could include, among other things: our ability to identify attractive acquisitions and joint ventures; our ability to offer potential acquisition targets and joint ventures competitive transaction terms; our ability to realize the benefits or cost savings that we expect to realize as a result of the acquisition or joint venture; diversion of management's attention; our ability to successfully integrate our businesses with the business of the acquired company; motivating, recruiting and retaining key employees; conforming standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures among our company and the acquired company; consolidating and streamlining sales, marketing and corporate operations; potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies; loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business; and managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations following completion of an acquisition or entry into a joint venture. If an acquisition or joint venture is not successfully completed or integrated into our existing operations, our business and financial results could be materially adversely impacted.Risks associated with operating our joint ventures may materially adversely affect our business and financial results.    We have entered into several joint ventures, including our MillerCoors joint venture in the United States and Puerto Rico with SABMiller. We may enter into additional joint ventures in the future. Our joint venture partners may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or with the goals of the joint venture. In addition, we compete against our joint venture partners in certain of our other markets. Disagreements with our business partners may impede our ability to maximize the benefits of our partnerships and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Our joint venture arrangements may require us, among other matters, to pay certain costs or to make certain capital investments or to seek our joint venture partner's consent to take certain actions. In addition, our joint venture partners may be unable or unwilling to meet their economic or other obligations under the operative documents, and we may be required to either fulfill those obligations alone to ensure the ongoing success of a joint venture or to dissolve and liquidate a joint venture. For example, in December 2013 we sold our interest in our MC Si'hai joint venture in China, following the failure of our partner to meet its obligations in 2012. Additionally, we have entered into an agreement to 17Table of Contentsaccelerate the termination of our MMI joint venture that imports, distributes and markets the Modelo beer brand portfolio across all Canadian provinces and territories, which, when consummated, will have an adverse impact on our Canadian volumes and financial results.We depend on key personnel, the loss of whom would harm our business.    The loss of the services and expertise of any key employee could harm our business. Our future success depends on our ability to identify, attract and retain qualified personnel on a timely basis. Turnover of senior management can adversely impact our stock price, our results of operations and our client relationships and may make recruiting for future management positions more difficult. In addition, we must successfully integrate any new management personnel that we hire within our organization, or who join our organization as a result of an acquisition, in order to achieve our operating objectives, and changes in other key management positions may temporarily affect our financial performance and results of operations as new management becomes familiar with our business. Our operations outside of North America and the U.K. expose us to additional risks which could harm our business and financial results.    We expect our operations outside of North America and the U.K. to become more significant to our operating results as we continue to further expand internationally. In certain of these markets, we have limited operating experience and may not succeed. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our operations in these markets expose us to additional risks, including: changes in local political, economic, social and labor conditions; restrictions on foreign ownership and investments; repatriation of cash earned in countries outside the U.S.; import and export requirements; increased costs to ensure compliance with complex foreign laws and regulations; currency exchange rate fluctuations; a less developed and less certain legal and regulatory environment, which among other things can create uncertainty with regard to liability issues; longer payment cycles, increased credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud; and other challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences.In addition, as a global company, we are subject to foreign and U.S. laws and regulations designed to combat governmental corruption, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and a materially negative impact on our brands and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, there can be no assurance that our employees, business partners or agents will not violate our policies.Loss of a major brewery or other key facility, due to unforeseen or catastrophic events or otherwise, could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results.    Our business and financial results could be materially adversely impacted by physical risks such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, other natural disasters or catastrophic events that damage or destroy one of our breweries or key facilities or the key facilities of our suppliers. Additionally, certain catastrophes are not covered by our general insurance policies, which could result in significant unrecoverable losses. In addition, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted by under-investment in physical assets or production capacity, including contract brewing and effect on priority of MCBC brands if production capacity is limited.Failure to comply with our debt covenants or a deterioration in our credit rating could have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain future financing at competitive rates and/or our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness.   Under the terms of each of our debt facilities, we must comply with certain restrictions. These include restrictions on priority indebtedness (certain threshold percentages of secured consolidated net tangible assets), leverage thresholds, liens, and restrictions on certain types of sale lease-back transactions and transfers of assets. Failure to comply with these restrictions or maintain our credit rating may result in issues with our current financing structure and potential future financing requirements. A deterioration in our credit rating could also affect our ability to obtain future financing or refinance our current debt, as well as increase our borrowing rates, which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.Risks Specific to the Canada SegmentWe may experience adverse impacts to our Canada business and financial results due to declines in the overall Canadian beer industry, continued price discounting, increased cost of goods sold and higher taxes.    If the Canadian beer market continues to decline, the impact to our financial results could be exacerbated due to our significant share of the overall market. Additionally, continuation, acceleration or the increase of price discounting, in Ontario, Québec, Alberta or other provinces, as well as increases in our cost of goods sold, could adversely impact our business. Further, changes in the Canadian tax legislation, such as the recent increase in beer excise taxes in Quebec, could decrease our net sales. Moreover, the future success and earnings growth of the Canada business depends, in part, on our ability to efficiently conduct our operations. Failure to generate significant cost savings and margin improvement through our ongoing initiatives could adversely affect our profitability.18Table of ContentsIn the event that we are required to move away from the industry standard returnable bottle we use today, we may incur unexpected losses.    Along with ABI and other brewers in Canada, we currently use an industry standard returnable bottle which represents more than 43% of total volume sales (excluding imports) in Canada. Changes to the Industry Standard Bottle Agreement could impact our use of the industry standard returnable bottle. If we cease to use the industry standard returnable bottle, our current bottle inventory and a portion of our bottle packaging equipment could become obsolete and could result in a material write-off of these assets.Risks Specific to the United States Segment and MillerCoorsWe do not fully control the operations and administration of MillerCoors, which represents our interests in the U.S. beer business.    We jointly control MillerCoors with SABMiller and hold a 42% economic interest in the joint venture. While we direct the MillerCoors business through our equal representation on its board of directors (along with SABMiller) and otherwise impact its business activities through our ongoing communication and oversight, MillerCoors’ management is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the business. As a result, we do not have full control over MillerCoors’ activities. Our results of operations are dependent upon the efforts of MillerCoors management, our ability to govern the joint venture effectively with SABMiller and factors beyond our control that may affect SABMiller. Additionally, our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to MillerCoors are necessarily substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. Each party to the MillerCoors joint venture agreed not to transfer its economic or voting interests in the joint venture for a period of five years from July 1, 2008. With the expiration of the restriction in 2013, both parties to the joint venture are now able to transfer their economic and voting interest. Certain rights of first refusal will apply to any assignment of such interests. Any transfer of ownership interest could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial position, as well as our ongoing internal and external business relationships.MillerCoors is highly dependent on independent distributors in the United States to sell its products, with no assurance that these distributors will effectively sell its and our products.    MillerCoors sells all of its products and our non-U.S. products in the United States to distributors for resale to retail outlets and the regulatory environment of many states makes it very difficult to change distributors. Consequently, if MillerCoors is not allowed or is unable to replace unproductive or inefficient distributors, its business, financial position and results of operation may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Risks Specific to the Europe SegmentWe may not recognize the benefits of the Acquisition.    We may not realize the expected benefits of the Acquisition because of integration difficulties and other challenges. The long-term success of the Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize all or some of the anticipated synergies and other benefits from integrating Central Europe's business with our existing businesses. The integration process may be complex, costly and time-consuming. The difficulties of recognizing the potential benefits of the Acquisition include, among others:•failure to implement our business plan for the combined business;•unanticipated issues in integrating manufacturing, logistics, information, procurement, communications and other systems;•possible inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, and compensation structures betweenCentral Europe's structure and our structure;•failure to retain key customers and suppliers;•unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;•operating risks inherent in Central Europe's business and our business;•unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities. We may not be able to maintain the levels of revenue, earnings or operating efficiency that each of Molson Coors and Central Europe had achieved or might achieve separately. In addition, we may not accomplish the integration of Central Europe's business smoothly, successfully or within the anticipated costs or timeframe. Moreover, the markets in which Central Europe operates may not experience the growth rates expected and any further economic downturn affecting Europe could negatively impact Central Europe's business. These markets are in differing stages of development and may experience more volatility than expected or face more operating risks than in the more mature markets in which Molson Coors has historically operated. If we experience difficulties with the integration process or if the Central Europe business or the markets in which it operates deteriorate, the anticipated cost savings, growth opportunities and other synergies of the Acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. In such case, our business and financial results may be materially adversely impacted.19Table of ContentsEconomic trends and intense competition in European markets could unfavorably impact our profitability.    Our European businesses have been and may continue to be adversely affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic and political conditions generally. As a result of our annual impairment testing, we determined that the fair value of our Jelen and Ostravar indefinite-lived brand intangible assets were below their respective carrying values as of June 30, 2013. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge in the third quarter of 2013. The decline in fair value of these brands was due, in part, to the continued weakening of the current macro-economic environment in certain European markets. Our impairment testing also indicated risk of additional future impairments of Jelen and other indefinite-lived intangible brands sold in these markets. Additionally, we face intense competition in certain of our European markets, particularly with respect to price, which could lead to reduced sales or profitability. In particular, the on-going focus by large competitors in Europe to drive increased market share through aggressive pricing strategies could adversely affect our sales and results of operations. In addition, in recent years, beer volume sales in Europe have been shifting from pubs and restaurants (on-premise) to retail stores (off-premise), for the industry in general. Margins on sales to off-premise customers tend to be lower than margins on sales to on-premise customers, and, as a result, continuation or acceleration of these trends would further adversely impact our profitability.In the event that a significant pub chain was to go bankrupt, or experience similar financial difficulties, our business and financial results could be materially adversely impacted.    We extend credit to pub chains in the U.K., and in some cases the amounts are significant. The continuing challenging economic environment in the U.K. has caused business at on-premise outlets to decrease since late 2008, and some pub chains may face increasing financial difficulty, if economic conditions do not improve. In the event that one or more significant pub chains were to be unable to pay amounts owed to us as a result of bankruptcy or similar financial difficulties, our business and financial results could be materially adversely impacted. Risks Specific to the Molson Coors International SegmentAn inability to expand our operations in emerging markets could adversely affect our growth prospects.    Our ability to grow our MCI segment in emerging markets depends on social, economic and political conditions in those markets and on our ability to create effective product distribution networks and consumer brand awareness in new markets. Due to product price, local competition from competitors that are larger and have more resources than we do and cultural differences, there is no assurance that our products will be accepted in any particular emerging market. If we are unable to expand our businesses in emerging markets, our growth prospects could be adversely affected.Risks Specific to Our Discontinued OperationsIndemnities provided to the purchaser of 83% of the Cervejarias Kaiser Brasil S.A. (""Kaiser"") business in Brazil could result in future cash outflows and statement of operations charges.    In 2006, we sold our 83% ownership interest in Kaiser to FEMSA Cerveza S.A. de C.V. (""FEMSA""). The terms of the sale agreement require us to indemnify FEMSA for exposures related to certain tax, civil and labor contingencies and certain purchased tax credits. The ultimate resolution of these claims is not under our control. These indemnity obligations are recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, however, we could incur future statement of operations charges as facts further develop resulting in changes to our estimates or changes in our assessment of probability of loss on these items as well as due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Due to the uncertainty involved in the ultimate outcome and timing of these contingencies, significant adjustments to the carrying value of our indemnity liabilities and corresponding statement of operations charges/credits could result in the future"
15,TAP,MOLSON COORS BREWING CO,2013-02-22,"ITEM 1A.    Risk Factors
The reader should carefully consider the following risk factors and the other information contained within this document. The risks set forth below are those that management believes are most likely to have a material adverse effect on us. We may also be subject to other risks or uncertainties not presently known to us. If any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occur, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects.Risks Specific to Our CompanyCompetition in our markets could require us to reduce prices or increase capital and other expenditures or cause us to lose sales volume, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    In most of our markets, our primary competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, production and distribution resources than 13Table of Contentswe, and are more diverse in terms of their geographies and brand portfolios. In all of the markets in which we operate, aggressive marketing strategies by these competitors could adversely affect our financial results. In addition, continuing consolidation among major global brewers may lead to stronger or new competitors, loss of partner brands and predatory marketing and pricing tactics by competitors. Moreover, several of our major markets are mature. Our products also compete for consumers against non-beer products such as wine, spirits and other alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Our success as an enterprise depends largely on the success of relatively few products in several mature markets; the failure or weakening of one or more of these products or markets could materially adversely affect our financial results.    Our Molson Canadian and Coors Light brands in Canada, Miller Lite and Coors Light brands in the U.S., and Carling brand in the U.K. represented more than half of each respective segment's sales in 2012. Consequently, any material shift in consumer preferences away from these brands, or from the categories in which they compete, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Consumer preferences and tastes may shift away from our brands or beer generally due to, among others, changing taste preferences, demographics or perceived value. Beer consumption in many of our markets is also tied to general economic conditions. Difficult macro-economic conditions in our markets may result in lower sales volume.If Pentland and the Coors Trust do not agree on a matter submitted to stockholders, generally the matter will not be approved, even if beneficial to us or favored by other stockholders.    Pentland Securities (1981) Inc. (the ""Pentland Trust"") (a company controlled by the Molson family and related parties) and the Adolph Coors, Jr. Trust (the ""Coors Trust""), which together control more than ninety percent of our Class A common stock and Class A exchangeable shares, have voting trust agreements through which they have combined their voting power over the shares of our Class A common stock and the Class A exchangeable shares that they own. In the event that these two stockholders do not agree to vote in favor of a matter submitted to a stockholder vote (other than the election of directors), the voting trustees will be required to vote all of the Class A common stock and Class A exchangeable shares deposited in the voting trusts against the matter. There is no other mechanism in the voting trust agreements to resolve a potential deadlock between these stockholders. Therefore, if either the Pentland Trust or the Coors Trust is unwilling to vote in favor of a proposal that is subject to a stockholder vote, we would be unable to implement the proposal even if our board, management or other stockholders believe the proposal is beneficial to us. Similarly, our bylaws require the authorization of a super-majority (two-thirds) of the board of directors to take certain transformational actions. Thus it is possible that the Company will not be authorized to take action even if it is supported by a simple majority of the board. In addition, our Class B common stock has fewer voting rights than our Class A common stock.Poor investment performance of pension plan holdings and other factors impacting pension plan costs could unfavorably impact liquidity and results of operations.    Our costs of providing defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on the plans' assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, exchange rate fluctuations, future government regulation, global equity prices, and our required and/or voluntary contributions to the plans. While we comply with the minimum funding requirements, we have certain qualified pension plans with obligations which exceed the value of the plans' assets. Without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans' assets, and depending upon the other factors as listed above, we could be required to fund the plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on our cash flows, credit rating and cost of borrowing, financial position or results of operations.We rely on a small number of suppliers to obtain the packaging we need to operate our business. The inability to obtain materials could unfavorably affect our ability to produce our products.    We purchase certain types of packaging materials including aluminum, glass and paperboard from a small number of suppliers. Consolidation of the packaging materials suppliers has reduced local supply alternatives and increased risks of supply disruptions. The inability of any of these suppliers to meet our production requirements without sufficient time to develop an alternative source could have a material adverse effect on our business.Termination of one or more manufacturer/distribution agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business.    We manufacture and/or distribute products of other beverage companies through various joint ventures, licensing, distribution or other arrangements. The loss of one or more of these arrangements, as a result of industry consolidation or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on the business and financial results of one or more reporting segments. For example, Miller Brewing Company (“Miller”) has notified us of its intent to terminate the license agreement between Miller and us in Canada, which could have an adverse impact on our Canadian volumes.Changes in tax, environmental or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing, trade and other regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.    Our business is highly regulated by federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in various countries regarding such matters as licensing requirements, trade and pricing practices, labeling, advertising, promotion and marketing practices, relationships with distributors, environmental matters, smoking bans at on-premise locations and other matters. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent re-evaluation, varying interpretations and political debate and inquiries from government regulators charged with their enforcement. Examples of this are the recently announced increase in beer excise tax rates of over 20% in Québec and a 50% 14Table of Contentsincrease to the statutory corporate income tax rate in Serbia. Failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or changes in these laws and regulations or in tax, environmental, excise tax levels imposed or any other laws or regulations could result in the loss, revocation or suspension of our licenses, permits or approvals and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations and the amount and timing of future taxable income. Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded. Finally, advocates of prohibition and other severe restrictions on the marketing and sales of alcohol are becoming increasingly organized on a global basis, seeking to impose regulations to curtail substantially the consumption of alcohol, including beer, in developed and developing markets. To the extent such views gain traction in national regulations where we do or plan to do business, they could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.Our consolidated financial statements are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, most significantly the Canadian dollar, British Pound and our Central European operating currencies such as, but not limited to, Euro, Czech Koruna, Croatian Kuna, Serbian Dinar, New Romanian Leu and Bulgarian Lev.    We hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in different currencies, most significantly in Canada and in the U.K and throughout Central Europe. Because our financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars (""USD""), we must translate our assets, liabilities, income and expenses into USD. Increases and decreases in the value of the USD will affect, perhaps adversely, the value of these items in our financial statements, even if their local currency value has not changed. To the extent that we fail to adequately manage these risks, including if our hedging arrangements do not effectively or completely hedge changes in foreign currency rates, our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted.Our operations face significant exposure to changes in commodity prices, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.    We use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials to produce our products, including barley, barley malt, hops, corn, other various starches, water and packaging materials, including aluminum, cardboard and other paper products. We also use a significant amount of diesel fuel and electricity in our operations. The supply and price of these raw materials and commodities can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including market demand, global geopolitical events (especially as to their impact on crude oil prices and the resulting impact on diesel fuel prices), frosts, droughts and other weather conditions, economic factors affecting growth decisions, inflation, plant diseases and theft. To the extent any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of ingredients or packaging or our hedging arrangements do not effectively or completely hedge changes in commodity price risks, our results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted.The success of our business relies heavily on brand image, reputation, product quality and protection of intellectual property.    It is important that we maintain and increase the image and reputation of our existing products. Concerns about product quality, even when unsubstantiated, could be harmful to our image and reputation of our products. Deterioration to our brand equity may be difficult to combat or reverse and could have a material effect on our business and financial results. In addition, because our brands carry family names, personal activities by certain members of the Molson or Coors families that harm their public image or reputation could have an adverse effect on our brands. Further, the success of our Company is dependent on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, including trademarks, patents, domain names, trade secrets and know-how.Due to a high concentration of unionized workers in Canada, the United Kingdom, and at MillerCoors in the U.S., we could be significantly affected by labor strikes, work stoppages or other employee-related issues.    Approximately 60%, 35% and 25% of our Canadian, MillerCoors and U.K. workforces, respectively, are represented by trade unions. Stringent labor laws in the U.K. expose us to a greater risk of loss should we experience labor disruptions in that market. A labor strike, work stoppage or other employee-related issue could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Changes to the regulation of the distribution systems for our products could adversely impact our business.    In our U.S. market, there is a three-tier distribution system that has historically applied to the distribution of products now sold through MillerCoors (including our non-U.S. products). That system is increasingly subject to the legal challenges on the basis that it allegedly interferes with interstate commerce. To the extent that such challenges are successful and require changes to the three-tier system, such changes could have a materially adverse impact on MillerCoors and, consequently, MCBC. Further, in certain Canadian provinces, our products are distributed through joint venture arrangements that are mandated and regulated by provincial government regulators. If provincial regulation should change, the costs to adjust our distribution methods could have a material adverse impact on our business.Changes in various supply chain standards or agreements could adversely impact our business.    Our business includes various joint venture and industry agreements which standardize parts of the supply chain system. An example includes our warehousing and customer delivery systems organized under joint venture agreements with other brewers. Any negative change in these agreements could have a material adverse impact on our business.15Table of ContentsBecause of our reliance on third-party service providers for certain administrative functions, we could experience a disruption to our business.    We rely exclusively on information services providers worldwide for our information technology functions including network, help desk, hardware and software configuration. We also have outsourced a significant portion of work associated with our finance and accounting, human resources and other information technology functions to a third-party service provider. If one of these service providers was to fail and we were unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner, we could be unable to properly administer our outsourced functions. Additionally, our internal and outsourced systems may also be the target of outside parties attempting to breach our security, which, if successful, could expose us to the loss of key business information and disruption of our operations.We may incur impairments of the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets.    In connection with various business combinations, we have allocated material amounts of the related purchase prices to goodwill and other intangible assets that are considered to have indefinite useful lives. These assets are tested for impairment at least annually, using estimates and assumptions affected by factors such as economic and industry conditions and changes in operating performance. Potential resulting charges could be material and could adversely impact our results of operations. Our most recent impairment analysis indicated that the fair value of our U.K. and Canada reporting units were close to failing step one of the goodwill impairment test. The fair value of the U.K. reporting unit and the Canada reporting unit were estimated at approximately 7% and 15% in excess of their carrying values, respectively. In addition, the fair value of the Molson core brands was estimated at approximately 14% in excess of its carrying value. The reporting units and Molson core brands are therefore at risk of a future impairment in the event of significant unfavorable changes in the forecasted cash flows, terminal growth rates, market transaction multiples and/or weighted-average cost of capital utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis. Additionally, we have identified risks to our Central Europe reporting unit due to weak economic conditions within the regions in which we operate, as well as risks related to the possible termination of our license agreement with Miller in Canada.Climate change and water availability may negatively affect our business.    There is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures could cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. While warmer weather has historically been associated with increased sales of beer, changing weather patterns could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions which may limit availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities, such as hops, barley and other cereal grains, which are important ingredients for our products. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. In addition, public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term, material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. There are also water availability risks. Climate change may cause water scarcity and a deterioration of water quality in areas where we maintain brewing operations. The competition for water among domestic, agricultural and manufacturing users is increasing in some of our brewing communities. Even where water is widely available, water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain our operations.Failure to successfully identify, complete or integrate attractive acquisitions and joint ventures into our existing operations could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.    We have made a number of acquisitions and entered into several joint ventures. In order to compete in the consolidating global brewing industry, we anticipate that we may, from time to time, in the future acquire additional businesses or enter into additional joint ventures that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our business. Potential issues associated with acquisitions and joint ventures could include, among other things: our ability to identify attractive acquisitions and joint ventures; our ability to offer potential acquisition targets and joint ventures competitive transaction terms; our ability to realize the benefits or cost savings that we expect to realize as a result of the acquisition or joint venture; diversion of management's attention; our ability to successfully integrate our businesses with the business of the acquired company; motivating, recruiting and retaining key employees; conforming standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures among our company and the acquired company; consolidating and streamlining sales, marketing and corporate operations; potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies; loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business; and managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations following completion of an acquisition or entry into a joint venture. If an acquisition or joint venture is not successfully completed or integrated into our existing operations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.Risks associated with operating our joint ventures may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.    We have entered into several joint ventures, including our MillerCoors joint venture in the United States and Puerto Rico with SABMiller. We may enter into additional joint ventures in the future. Our joint venture partners may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or with the goals of the joint venture. In addition, we compete against our joint venture partners in certain of our markets. Disagreements with our business partners may impede our ability to maximize the benefits of our partnerships and adversely affect our results of operations. Our joint venture arrangements may require us, among other matters, to pay certain costs or to make certain capital investments or 16Table of Contentsto seek our joint venture partner's consent to take certain actions. In addition, our joint venture partners may be unable or unwilling to meet their economic or other obligations under the operative documents, and we may be required to either fulfill those obligations alone to ensure the ongoing success of a joint venture or to dissolve and liquidate a joint venture. For example, during 2012, we decided to terminate our joint venture in China due to the failure of our joint venture partner to meet its obligations. We depend on key personnel, the loss of whom would harm our business.    The loss of the services and expertise of any key employee could harm our business. Our future success depends on our ability to identify, attract and retain qualified personnel on a timely basis. Turnover of senior management can adversely impact our stock price, our results of operations and our client relationships and may make recruiting for future management positions more difficult. In addition, we must successfully integrate any new management personnel that we hire within our organization in order to achieve our operating objectives, and changes in other key management positions may temporarily affect our financial performance and results of operations as new management becomes familiar with our business. Our operations outside of North America and the U.K. expose us to additional risks which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.    We expect our operations outside of North America and the U.K. to become more significant to our operating results as we continue to further expand internationally. In certain of these markets, we have limited operating experience and may not succeed. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our operations in these markets expose us to additional risks, including: changes in local political, economic, social and labor conditions; restrictions on foreign ownership and investments; repatriation of cash earned in countries outside the U.S.; import and export requirements; currency exchange rate fluctuations; a less developed and less certain legal and regulatory environment, which among other things can create uncertainty with regard to liability issues; longer payment cycles, increased credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud; and other challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences.Loss of a major brewery or other key facility, due to unforeseen or catastrophic events or otherwise, could have an adverse impact on our business.    Our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted by physical risks such as earthquakes, hurricanes, other natural disasters or catastrophic events that damage or destroy one of our breweries or key facilities. Additionally, certain catastrophes are not covered by our general insurance policies, which could result in significant unrecoverable losses.Impacts of the Acquisition on our financial position.    As a result of the Acquisition, the already significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated financial statements increased. Such amounts are subject to impairment assessments based upon future adverse changes in our business or prospects. In addition, we incurred a significant amount of additional indebtedness in connection with the Acquisition. After giving effect to our $1.9 billion senior notes offering, borrowings under the new credit and term loan agreements in connection with the Acquisition and the issuance of the Convertible Note to the Seller, we have outstanding $4,668 million of indebtedness as of December 29, 2012, and the ability to incur up to an additional €150 million, $550 million and $400 million of indebtedness under our revolving credit facilities. We may incur significantly more indebtedness in the future. As a result of the debt that we incurred in connection with the Acquisition, we have suspended share repurchases until our credit metrics are closer to pre-Acquisition levels, and there can be no assurance that our credit ratings will remain at an investment grade level or that they will improve. Additionally, any deterioration of our current credit rating from an investment grade level could result in less than favorable terms of future debt issuances, which may be necessary to support the ongoing needs of the business, fund future capital investments or acquisitions or refinance terms of our debt obligations currently outstanding. We also intend to use cash from operations to reduce our debt level, which will reduce funds available for other purposes and may increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions. In addition, our indebtedness also subjects us to financial and operating covenants, which may limit our flexibility in responding to our business needs. If we are not able to maintain compliance with stated financial ratios or if we breach any of the other covenants in any debt agreement, we could be in default under such agreement. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies.Risks Specific to the Canada SegmentWe may experience continued price discounting in Canada.    The continuation, acceleration or the increase of price discounting, in Ontario, Québec, Alberta or other provinces, could adversely impact our business.In the event that we are required to move away from the industry standard returnable bottle we use today, we may incur unexpected losses.    Along with ABI and other brewers in Canada, we currently use an industry standard returnable bottle which represents more than 40% of total volume sales in Canada. Changes to the Industry Standard Bottle Agreement could impact our use of the industry standard returnable bottle. If we cease to use the industry standard returnable bottle, our current bottle inventory and a portion of our bottle packaging equipment could become obsolete and could result in a material write-off of these assets.17Table of ContentsRisks Specific to the United States Segment and MillerCoorsWe do not fully control the operations and administration of MillerCoors, which represents our interests in the U.S. beer business.    We jointly control MillerCoors with SABMiller, and hold a 42% economic interest. MillerCoors management is responsible for the day to day operations of the business and therefore, we do not have full control over the activities of MillerCoors. Our results of operations are dependent upon the efforts of MillerCoors management, our ability to govern the joint venture effectively with SABMiller and factors beyond our control that may affect SABMiller. Additionally, our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to MillerCoors are necessarily substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries.We may incur unexpected costs or face other business issues from MillerCoors due to challenges associated with integrating operations, technologies and other aspects of the operations.    The MillerCoors management team continues to focus on fully integrating ours and SABMiller's U.S. operations, technologies and services, as well as the distribution networks including the resolution of disputes arising from the consolidation of distributors arising from the MillerCoors joint venture. The failure of MillerCoors to successfully integrate the two operations could adversely affect our financial results or prospects.MillerCoors is highly dependent on independent distributors in the United States to sell its products, with no assurance that these distributors will effectively sell its and our products.    MillerCoors sells all of its products and our non-U.S. products in the United States to distributors for resale to retail outlets and the regulatory environment of many states makes it very difficult to change distributors. Consequently, if MillerCoors is not allowed or is unable to replace unproductive or inefficient distributors, its business, financial position and results of operation may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Risks Specific to the Central Europe SegmentWe may not recognize the benefits of the Acquisition.    We may not realize the expected benefits of the Acquisition because of integration difficulties and other challenges. The success of the Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize all or some of the anticipated synergies and other benefits from integrating MCCE's business with our existing businesses. The integration process may be complex, costly and time-consuming. The difficulties of integrating the operations of MCCE's business include, among others:•failure to implement our business plan for the combined business;•unanticipated issues in integrating manufacturing, logistics, information, communications and other systems;•possible inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, and compensation structures betweenMCCE's structure and our structure;•failure to retain key customers and suppliers;•unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;•failure to retain key employees;•operating risks inherent in MCCE's business and our business;•unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities; •unfamiliarity with operating in Central Europe.We may not be able to maintain the levels of revenue, earnings or operating efficiency that each of Molson Coors and MCCE had achieved or might achieve separately. In addition, we may not accomplish the integration of MCCE's business smoothly, successfully or within the anticipated costs or timeframe. Moreover, the markets in which MCCE operates may not experience the growth rates expected and any further economic downturn affecting Europe could negatively impact MCCE's business. These markets are in differing stages of development and may experience more volatility than expected or face more operating risks than in the more mature markets in which Molson Coors has historically operated. If we experience difficulties with the integration process or if the MCCE business or the markets in which it operates deteriorate, the anticipated cost savings, growth opportunities and other synergies of the Acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. In such case, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted.We face risks associated with the Sale and Purchase Agreement (""SPA"") in connection with the Acquisition.    In connection with the Acquisition, we assumed substantially all the liabilities of MCCE that were not satisfied on or prior to the closing date. There may be liabilities that we underestimated or did not discover in the course of performing our due diligence investigation of MCCE. Under the SPA and a management warranty deed (the ""Management Warranty Deed""), the Seller has agreed to provide us with a limited set of representations and warranties. Our sole remedy from the Seller for any breach of those representations and warranties is an action for indemnification, not to exceed €100 million under the SPA and €50 million under the Management Warranty Deed. Damages resulting from a breach of a representation or warranty could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.18Table of ContentsEconomic trends and intense competition in certain Central European markets could unfavorably impact our profitability.    Our Central European businesses have been and may continue to be adversely affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic and political conditions generally. During 2012, real gross domestic product declined in most of the major Central European markets in which we operate. Additionally, we face intense competition in certain of our Central European markets, particularly with respect to price, which could lead to reduced sales or profitability. In particular, the on-going focus by large competitors in Central Europe to drive increased market share through aggressive pricing strategies could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.Risks Specific to the United Kingdom SegmentSales volume trends in the United Kingdom brewing industry reflect movement from on-premise channels to off-premise channels, a trend which unfavorably impacts our profitability.    In recent years, beer volume sales in the U.K. have been shifting from pubs and restaurants (on-premise) to retail stores (off-premise), for the industry in general. A ban on smoking in pubs and restaurants across the whole of the U.K. enacted in 2007 accelerated this trend. Margins on sales to off-premise customers tend to be lower than margins on sales to on-premise customers, and, as a result, continuation or acceleration of these trends would further adversely impact our profitability.Consolidation of pubs and growth in the size of pub chains in the United Kingdom could unfavorably impact pricing.    The trend toward consolidation of pubs, away from independent pub and club operations, is continuing in the United Kingdom. These larger entities have stronger price negotiating power, and therefore continuation of this trend could impact our ability to obtain favorable pricing in the on-premise channel (due to the spillover effect of reduced negotiating leverage) and could reduce our revenues and profit margins. In addition, these larger customers continue to move to purchasing directly more of the products that, in the past, we have provided as part of our factored business. Further consolidation could contribute to an adverse financial impact.In the event that a significant pub chain were to go bankrupt, or experience similar financial difficulties, our business could be adversely impacted.    We extend credit to pub chains in the U.K., and in some cases the amounts are significant. The continuing challenging economic environment in the U.K. has caused business at on-premise outlets to slow since late 2008, and some pub chains may face increasing financial difficulty if economic conditions do not improve. In the event that a pub chain were to be unable to pay amounts owed to us as a result of bankruptcy or similar financial difficulties, our business could be adversely impacted. We depend exclusively on one logistics provider for the distribution of our products in the United Kingdom.    Tradeteam handles all of the physical distribution for us in the U.K., except where a different distribution system is requested by a customer. If Tradeteam were unable to continue distribution of our products and we were unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner, we could experience significant disruptions in our business that could have an adverse financial impact.Risks Specific to the Molson Coors International SegmentAn inability to expand our operations in emerging markets could adversely affect our growth prospects.    Our ability to grow our MCI segment in emerging markets depends on social, economic and political conditions in those markets and on our ability to create effective product distribution networks and consumer brand awareness in new markets. Due to product price, local competition and cultural differences, there is no assurance that our products will be accepted in any particular emerging market. If we are unable to expand our businesses in emerging markets, our growth prospects could be adversely affected.In addition, compliance with complex foreign laws and regulations, and U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in some international jurisdictions. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and a materially negative impact on our brands and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, there can be no assurance that our employees, business partners or agents will not violate our policies.Risks Specific to Our Discontinued OperationsIndemnities provided to the purchaser of 83% of the Cervejarias Kaiser Brasil S.A. (""Kaiser"") business in Brazil could result in future cash outflows and statement of operations charges.    In 2006, we sold our 83% ownership interest in Kaiser to FEMSA Cerveza S.A. de C.V. (""FEMSA""). The terms of the sale agreement require us to indemnify FEMSA for exposures related to certain tax, civil and labor contingencies and certain purchased tax credits. The ultimate resolution of these claims is not under our control. These indemnity obligations are recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, 19Table of Contentshowever, we could incur future statement of operations charges as facts further develop resulting in changes to our estimates or changes in our assessment of probability of loss on these items as well as due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Due to the uncertainty involved in the ultimate outcome and timing of these contingencies, significant adjustments to the carrying value of our indemnity liabilities and corresponding statement of operations charges/credits could result in the future"
14,TAP,MOLSON COORS BREWING CO,2012-02-27,"ITEM 1A.    Risk Factors
The reader should carefully consider the following risk factors and the other information contained within this document. The most important factors that could influence the achievement of our goals, and cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to, the following:Risks Specific to Our CompanyCompetition in our markets could require us to reduce prices or increase capital and other expenditures or cause us to lose sales volume, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    In most of our markets, our primary competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, production and distribution resources than us, and are more diverse in terms of their geographies and brand portfolios. In all of the markets in which we operate, aggressive marketing strategies by these competitors could adversely affect our financial results. Moreover, each of our major markets is mature.Our success as an enterprise depends largely on the success of relatively few products in several mature markets; the failure or weakening of one or more of these products or markets could materially adversely affect our financial results.    Our Molson Canadian and Coors Light brands in Canada, Miller Lite and Coors Light brands in the U.S., and Carling brand in the U.K. represented more than half of each respective segment's sales in 2011. Consequently, any material shift in consumer preferences away from these brands, or from the categories in which they compete, could have a material adverse effect on our business.If Pentland and the Coors Trust do not agree on a matter submitted to stockholders, generally the matter will not be approved, even if beneficial to us or favored by other stockholders.    Pentland Securities (1981) Inc. (the ""Pentland Trust"") (a company controlled by the Molson family and related parties) and the Adolph Coors, Jr. Trust (the ""Coors Trust""), which together control more than ninety percent of our Class A common stock and Class A exchangeable shares, have voting trust agreements through which they have combined their voting power over the shares of our Class A common stock and the Class A exchangeable shares that they own. In the event that these two stockholders do not agree to vote in favor of a matter submitted to a stockholder vote (other than the election of directors), the voting trustees will be required to vote all of the Class A common stock and Class A exchangeable shares deposited in the voting trusts against the matter. There is no other mechanism in the voting trust agreements to resolve a potential deadlock between these stockholders. Therefore, if either the Pentland Trust or the Coors Trust is unwilling to vote in favor of a proposal that is subject to a stockholder vote, we would be unable to implement the proposal even if our board, management or other stockholders believe the proposal is beneficial to us. Similarly, our bylaws require the authorization of a super-majority (two-thirds) of the board of directors to take certain transformational actions. Thus it is possible that the Company will not be authorized to take action even if it is supported by a simple majority of the board.Poor investment performance of pension plan holdings and other factors impacting pension plan costs could unfavorably impact liquidity and results of operations.    Our costs of providing defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on the plans' assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, exchange rate fluctuations, future government regulation, global 12Table of Contentsequity prices, and our required and/or voluntary contributions to the plans. While we comply with the minimum funding requirements, we have certain qualified pension plans with obligations which exceed the value of the plans' assets. Without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans' assets, and depending upon the other factors as listed above, we could be required to fund the plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on our cash flows, credit rating and cost of borrowing, financial position, or results of operations.We rely on a small number of suppliers to obtain the packaging we need to operate our business. The inability to obtain materials could unfavorably affect our ability to produce our products.    We purchase certain types of packaging materials including aluminum, glass and paperboard from a small number of suppliers. Consolidation of the packaging materials suppliers has reduced local supply alternatives and increased risks of supply disruptions. The inability of any of these suppliers to meet our production requirements without sufficient time to develop an alternative source could have a material adverse effect on our business.Termination of one or more manufacturer/distribution agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business.    We manufacture and/or distribute products of other beverage companies through various joint ventures, licensing, distribution or other arrangements. The loss of one or more of these arrangements, as a result of industry consolidation or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on the business and financial results of one or more reporting segments.Changes in tax, environmental or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing, trade and other regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.    Our business is highly regulated by federal, state, provincial, and local laws and regulations in various countries regarding such matters as licensing requirements, trade and pricing practices, labeling, advertising, promotion and marketing practices, relationships with distributors, environmental matters, smoking bans at on-premise locations, and other matters. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent re-evaluation, varying interpretations and political debate and inquiries from government regulators charged with their enforcement. Failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or changes in these laws and regulations or in tax, environmental, excise tax levels imposed or any other laws or regulations could result in the loss, revocation or suspension of our licenses, permits or approvals and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Finally, advocates of prohibition and other severe restrictions on the marketing and sales of alcohol are becoming increasingly organized on a global basis, seeking to impose regulations to curtail substantially the consumption of alcohol, including beer, in developed and developing markets. To the extent such views gain traction in national regulations where we do or plan to do business, they could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.Our consolidated financial statements are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, most significantly the British Pound (""GBP"") and the Canadian dollar (""CAD"").    We hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in different currencies, most significantly in Canada and in the U.K. Because our financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars (""USD""), we must translate our assets, liabilities, income and expenses into USD. Increases and decreases in the value of the USD will affect, perhaps adversely, the value of these items in our financial statements, even if their local currency value has not changed. To the extent that we fail to adequately manage these risks, including if our hedging arrangements do not effectively or completely hedge changes in foreign currency rates, our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted.Our operations face significant exposure to changes in commodity prices, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.    We use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials to produce our products, including barley, barley malt, hops, corn, other various starches, water, and packaging materials, including aluminum, cardboard and other paper products. We also use a significant amount of diesel fuel in our operations. The supply and price of these raw materials and commodities can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including market demand, global geopolitical events (especially as to their impact on crude oil prices and the resulting impact on diesel fuel prices), frosts, droughts and other weather conditions, economic factors affecting growth decisions, plant diseases, and theft. To the extent any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of ingredients or packaging or our hedging arrangements do not effectively or completely hedge changes in commodity price risks, our results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted.The success of our business relies heavily on brand image, reputation, and product quality.    It is important that we maintain and increase the image and reputation of our existing products. Concerns about product quality, even when unsubstantiated, could be harmful to our image and reputation of our products. Deterioration to our brand equity may have a material effect on our business and financial results.Due to a high concentration of unionized workers in Canada, the United Kingdom, and at MillerCoors in the U.S., we could be significantly affected by labor strikes, work stoppages, or other employee-related issues.    Approximately 61%, 36% and 25% of our Canadian, MillerCoors, and U.K. workforces, respectively, are represented by trade unions. Stringent labor laws in the U.K. expose us to a greater risk of loss should we experience labor disruptions in that market. Any labor strike, work stoppage or other employee-related issue could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.13Table of ContentsChanges to the regulation of the distribution systems for our products could adversely impact our business.    In our U.S. market, there is a three-tier distribution system that has historically applied to the distribution of products now sold through MillerCoors (including our non-U.S. products). That system is increasingly subject to the legal challenges on the basis that it allegedly interferes with interstate commerce. To the extent that such challenges are successful and require changes to the three-tier system, such changes could have a materially adverse impact on MillerCoors and, consequently, MCBC. Further, in certain Canadian provinces, our products are distributed through joint venture arrangements that are mandated and regulated by provincial government regulators. If provincial regulation should change, the costs to adjust our distribution methods could have a material adverse impact on our business.Changes in various supply chain standards or agreements could adversely impact our business.    Our business includes various joint venture and industry agreements which standardize parts of the supply chain system. An example includes our warehousing and customer delivery systems organized under joint venture agreements with other brewers. Any negative change in these agreements could have a material adverse impact on our business.Because of our reliance on third-party service providers for certain administrative functions, we could experience a disruption to our business.    We rely exclusively on one information services provider worldwide for our information technology functions including network, help desk, hardware, and software configuration. We also have outsourced a significant portion of work associated with our finance and accounting, human resources, and other information technology functions to a third-party service provider. If one of these service providers was to fail and we were unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner, we could be unable to properly administer our outsourced functions.We may incur impairments of the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives.    In connection with various business combinations, we have allocated material amounts of the related purchase prices to goodwill and other intangible assets that are considered to have indefinite useful lives. These assets are tested for impairment at least annually, using estimates and assumptions affected by factors such as economic and industry conditions and changes in operating performance. Potential resulting charges could be material and could adversely impact our results of operations.Climate change and water availability may negatively affect our business.    There is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures could cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. While warmer weather has historically been associated with increased sales of beer, changing weather patterns could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions which may limit availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities, such as hops, barley and other cereal grains, which are important ingredients for our products. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. In addition, public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term, material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. There are also water availability risks. Climate change may cause water scarcity and a deterioration of water quality in areas where we maintain brewing operations. The competition for water among domestic, agricultural and manufacturing users is increasing in some of our brewing communities. Even where water is widely available, water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain our operations.Failure to successfully complete or integrate acquisitions and joint ventures into our existing operations could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.    We have made a number of acquisitions and entered into several joint ventures. We anticipate that we may, from time to time, in the future acquire additional businesses or enter into additional joint ventures that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our business. Potential issues associated with acquisitions and joint ventures could include, among other things: our ability to realize the benefits or cost savings that we expect to realize as a result of the acquisition or  joint venture; diversion of management's attention; our ability to successfully integrate our businesses with the business of the acquired company; motivating, recruiting and retaining executives and key employees; conforming standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures among our company and the acquired company; consolidating and streamlining sales, marketing and corporate operations; potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies; loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business; and managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations following completion of an acquisition or entry into a joint venture. If an acquisition or joint venture is not successfully completed or integrated into our existing operations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.Risks associated with operating our joint ventures may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.    We have entered into several joint ventures, including our MillerCoors joint venture in the United States and Puerto Rico with SABMiller. We may enter into additional joint ventures in the future. Our joint venture partners may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or with the goals of the joint venture. Our joint venture arrangements may require us, among other matters, to pay certain costs or to make certain capital 14Table of Contentsinvestments or to seek our joint venture partner's consent to take certain actions. In addition, our joint venture partners may be unable or unwilling to meet their economic or other obligations under the operative documents, and we may be required to either fulfill those obligations alone to ensure the ongoing success of a joint venture or to dissolve and liquidate a joint venture.We depend on key personnel, the loss of whom would harm our business.    The loss of the services and expertise of any key employee could harm our business. Our future success depends on our ability to identify, attract and retain qualified personnel on a timely basis. Turnover of senior management can adversely impact our stock price, our results of operations and our client relationships and may make recruiting for future management positions more difficult. In addition, we must successfully integrate any new management personnel that we hire within our organization in order to achieve our operating objectives, and changes in other key management positions may temporarily affect our financial performance and results of operations as new management becomes familiar with our business. Risks Specific to the Canada SegmentWe may experience continued price discounting in Canada.    The continuation, or the increase of price discounting, in Ontario, Québec, Alberta or other provinces, could adversely impact our business.In the event that we are required to move away from the industry standard returnable bottle we use today, we may incur unexpected losses.    Along with ABI and other brewers in Canada, we currently use an industry standard returnable bottle which represents the significant majority of the more than 50% bottle volume sales in Canada. Changes to the Industry Standard Bottle Agreement could impact our use of the industry standard returnable bottle. If we cease to use the industry standard returnable bottle, our current bottle inventory and a portion of our bottle packaging equipment could become obsolete and could result in a material write-off of these assets.Risks Specific to the United States Segment and MillerCoorsWe do not fully control the operations and administration of MillerCoors, which represents our interests in the U.S. beer business.    We jointly control MillerCoors with SABMiller, and hold a 42% economic interest. MillerCoors management is responsible for the day to day operations of the business and therefore, we do not have full control over the activities of MillerCoors. Our results of operations are dependent upon the efforts of MillerCoors management, our ability to govern the joint venture effectively with SABMiller, and factors beyond our control that may affect SABMiller. Additionally, our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to MillerCoors are necessarily substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries.We may incur unexpected costs or face other business issues from MillerCoors due to challenges associated with integrating operations, technologies, and other aspects of the operations.    The MillerCoors management team continues to focus on fully integrating ours and SABMiller's U.S. operations, technologies, and services, as well as the distribution networks including the resolution of disputes arising from the consolidation of distributors arising from the MillerCoors joint venture. The failure of MillerCoors to successfully integrate the two operations could adversely affect our financial results or prospects.MillerCoors is highly dependent on independent distributors in the United States to sell its products, with no assurance that these distributors will effectively sell its and our products.    MillerCoors sells all of its products and our non-U.S. products in the United States to distributors for resale to retail outlets and the regulatory environment of many states makes it very difficult to change distributors. Consequently, if MillerCoors is not allowed or is unable to replace unproductive or inefficient distributors, its business, financial position, and results of operation may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.Risks Specific to the United Kingdom SegmentSales volume trends in the United Kingdom brewing industry reflect movement from on-premise channels to off-premise channels, a trend which unfavorably impacts our profitability.    In recent years, beer volume sales in the U.K. have been shifting from pubs and restaurants (on-premise) to retail stores (off-premise), for the industry in general. A ban on smoking in pubs and restaurants across the whole of the U.K. enacted in 2007 accelerated this trend. Margins on sales to off-premise customers tend to be lower than margins on sales to on-premise customers, and, as a result, continuation or acceleration of these trends would further adversely impact our profitability.Consolidation of pubs and growth in the size of pub chains in the United Kingdom could unfavorably impact pricing.    The trend toward consolidation of pubs, away from independent pub and club operations, is continuing in the United Kingdom. These larger entities have stronger price negotiating power, and therefore continuation of this trend could impact our ability to obtain favorable pricing in the on-premise channel (due to the spillover effect of reduced negotiating leverage) and could reduce our revenues and profit margins. In addition, these larger customers continue to move to purchasing directly more of the products that, in the past, we have provided as part of our factored business. Further consolidation could contribute to an 15Table of Contentsadverse financial impact.In the event that a significant pub chain were to go bankrupt, or experience similar financial difficulties, our business could be adversely impacted.    We extend credit to pub chains in the U.K., and in some cases the amounts are significant. The continuing challenging economic environment in the U.K. has caused business at on-premise outlets to slow since late 2008, and some pub chains may face increasing financial difficulty if economic conditions do not improve. In the event that a pub chain were to be unable to pay amounts owed to us as a result of bankruptcy or similar financial difficulties, our business could be adversely impacted. We depend exclusively on one logistics provider for the distribution of our products in the United Kingdom.    Tradeteam handles all of the physical distribution for us in the U.K., except where a different distribution system is requested by a customer. If Tradeteam were unable to continue distribution of our products and we were unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner, we could experience significant disruptions in our business that could have an adverse financial impact.Risks Specific to the Molson Coors International SegmentAn inability to expand our operations in emerging markets could adversely affect our growth prospects.    Our ability to grow our MCI segment in emerging markets depends on social, economic and political conditions in those markets and on our ability to create effective product distribution networks and consumer brand awareness in new markets. Due to product price, local competition and cultural differences, there is no assurance that our products will be accepted in any particular emerging market. If we are unable to expand our businesses in emerging markets, our growth prospects could be adversely affected.Our operations in emerging markets expose us to additional risks which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.  We expect our operations in emerging markets to become more significant to our operating results as we continue to further expand internationally. In certain emerging markets, we have limited operating experience and may not succeed. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our operations in emerging markets expose us to additional risks, including: changes in local political, economic, social, and labor conditions; restrictions on foreign ownership and investments; repatriation of cash earned in countries outside the U.S.; import and export requirements; currency exchange rate fluctuations; a less developed and certain legal and regulatory environment, which among other things can create uncertainty with regard to liability issues; longer payment cycles, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud; and other challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences.In addition, compliance with complex foreign laws and regulations, and U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in some international jurisdictions. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries. Risks Specific to Our Discontinued OperationsIndemnities provided to the purchaser of 83% of the Cervejarias Kaiser Brasil S.A. (""Kaiser"") business in Brazil could result in future cash outflows and statement of operations charges.    In 2006, we sold our 83% ownership interest in Kaiser to FEMSA Cerveza S.A. de C.V. (""FEMSA""). The terms of the sale agreement require us to indemnify FEMSA for exposures related to certain tax, civil and labor contingencies and certain purchased tax credits. The ultimate resolution of these claims is not under our control. These indemnity obligations are recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet, however, we could incur future statement of operations charges as facts further develop resulting in changes to our estimates or changes in our assessment of probability of loss on these items as well as due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Due to the uncertainty involved in the ultimate outcome and timing of these contingencies, significant adjustments to the carrying value of our indemnity liabilities and corresponding statement of operations charges/credits could result in the future"
1,TAP,MOLSON COORS BREWING CO,2011-02-22,"ITEM 1A.    Risk Factors
             The reader should carefully consider the following factors and the other information contained within this document. The most importantfactors that could influence the achievement of our goals, and cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to, thefollowing:  Risks Specific to Our Company           Competition in our markets could require us to reduce prices or increase capital and other expenditures or cause us to lose sales volume, any of which could have a materialadverseeffect on our business and financial results.    In most of our markets, our primary competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, production anddistribution resources than Molson Coors, and are more diverse in terms of their geographies and brand portfolios. In all of the markets in which Molson Coors operates, aggressive marketing strategiesby these competitors could adversely affect our financial results. Moreover, each of our major markets is mature.          Our success as an enterprise depends largely on the success of relatively few products in several mature markets; the failure or weakening of one or more of these products ormarketscould materially adversely affect our financial results.    Our Molson Canadian and CoorsLight brands in Canada, Miller Lite and Coors Light brands in the U.S., and  Carlingbrand in the U.K. represented more than half of each respective segment's sales in 2010. Consequently, any material shift in consumerpreferences away from these brands, or from the categories in which they compete, could have a material adverse effect on our business.          If Pentland and the Coors Trust do not agree on a matter submitted to stockholders, generally the matter will not be approved, even if beneficial to us or favored by otherstockholders.    Pentland Securities (a company controlled by the Molson family, related parties) (""Pentland"") and the Coors Trust, which together control more thantwo-thirds of our Class A common stock and Class A exchangeable shares, have voting trust agreements through which they have combined their voting power over the shares ofour Class A common stock and the Class A exchangeable shares that they own. In the event that these 15 Table of Contentstwostockholders do not agree to vote in favor of a matter submitted to a stockholder vote (other than the election of directors), the voting trustees will be required to vote all of theClass A common stock and Class A exchangeable shares deposited in the voting trusts against the matter. There is no other mechanism in the voting trust agreements to resolve a potentialdeadlock between these stockholders. Therefore, if either Pentland or the Coors Trust is unwilling to vote in favor of a proposal that is subject to a stockholder vote, we would be unable to implementthe proposal even if our board, management or other stockholders believe the proposal is beneficial to us. Similarly, our bylaws require the authorization of a super-majority (two-thirds)of the board of directors to take certain transformational actions. Thus it is possible that the Company will not be authorized to take action even if it is supported by a simple majority of theboard.          Poor investment performance of pension plan holdings and other factors impacting pension plan costs could unfavorably impact liquidity and results ofoperations.    Our costs of providing defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on the plans' assets, discountrates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, exchange rate fluctuations, future government regulation, global equity prices, and our requiredand/or voluntary contributions to the plans. While we comply with the minimum funding requirements, we have certain qualified pension plans with obligations which exceed the value of the plans'assets. Without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans' assets, and depending upon the other factors as listed above, we could be required to fund theplans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on our cash flows, credit rating and cost of borrowing, financial position, or results of operations.          We rely on a small number of suppliers to obtain the packaging we need to operate our business. The inability to obtain materials could unfavorably affect our ability to produceourproducts.    We purchase certain types of packaging materials including aluminum, glass and paperboard from a small number of suppliers. Consolidation of thepackaging materials suppliers has reduced local supply alternatives and increased risks of supply disruptions. The inability of any of these suppliers to meet our production requirements withoutsufficient time to develop an alternative source could have a material adverse effect on our business.          Termination of one or more manufacturer/distribution agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.    Wemanufacture and/ordistribute products of other beverage companies through various joint ventures, licensing, distribution or other arrangements. The loss of one or more of these arrangements, as a result of industryconsolidation or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on the business and financial results of one or more reporting segments.         We may not properly execute, or realize the anticipated $150 million of cost savings or benefits from, our ongoing cost savingsinitiatives.    Our success is partly dependent upon properly executing and realizing cost savings or other benefits from the additional cost savings initiatives, oursecond Resources for Growth (""RFG2""), identified during 2009. These initiatives are primarily designed to make the company more efficient across the business, which is a necessity in our highlycompetitive industry. These initiatives are often complex, and a failure to implement them properly may, in addition to not meeting projected cost savings or benefits, result in a strain on thecompany's sales, manufacturing, logistics, customer service, or finance and accounting functions. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.          Changes in tax, environmental or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing, trade and other regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financialcondition.    Our business is highly regulated by federal, state, provincial, and local laws and regulations in various countries regarding such matters as licensingrequirements, trade and pricing practices, labeling, advertising, promotion and marketing practices, relationships with distributors, environmental matters, smoking bans at on-premiselocations, and other matters. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent re-evaluation and 16 Table of Contentspoliticaldebate. Failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or changes in these laws and regulations or in tax, environmental, excise tax levels imposed or any other laws or regulationscould result in the loss, revocation or suspension of our licenses, permits or approvals and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Finally, advocates of prohibition and other severe restrictions on the marketing and sales of alcohol are becoming increasingly organized on a global basis, seeking to impose regulations to curtailsubstantially the consumption of alcohol, including beer, in developed and developing markets. To the extent such views gain traction in national regulations where we do or plan to do business, theycould have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.          Our consolidated financial statements are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, most significantlythe British pound (""GBP"") and the Canadian dollar (""CAD"").    We hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in different currencies, mostsignificantly in Canada and in the U.K. Since our financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars (""USD""), we must translate our assets, liabilities, income and expenses into USD. Increases anddecreases in the value of the USD will affect, perhaps adversely, the value of these items in our financial statements, even if their local currency value has not changed. To the extent that we failto adequately manage these risks, including if our hedging arrangements do not effectively or completely hedge changes in foreign currency rates, our results of operations may be materially andadversely impacted.         Our operations face significant exposure to changes in commodity prices, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.    We use alarge volume of agricultural and other raw materials to produce our products, including barley, barley malt, hops, corn, other various starches, water, and packaging materials, including aluminum,cardboard and other paper products. We also use a significant amount of diesel fuel in our operations. The supply and price of these raw materials and commodities can be affected by a number offactors beyond our control, including market demand, global geopolitical events (especially as to their impact on crude oil prices and the resulting impact on diesel fuel prices), frosts, droughts andother weather conditions, economic factors affecting growth decisions, plant diseases, and theft. To the extent any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of ingredients or packaging or ourhedging arrangements do not effectively or completely hedge changes in commodity price risks, our results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted.          The success of our business relies heavily on brand image, reputation, and product quality.    It is important we have the abilityto maintain andincrease the image and reputation of our existing products. Concerns about product quality, even when unsubstantiated, could be harmful to our image and reputation of our products. Deterioration toour brand equity may have a material effect on our business and financial results.          Due to a high concentration of unionized workers in Canada, the United Kingdom, and at MillerCoors in the U.S., we could be significantly affected by labor strikes, work stoppages, orother employee-related issues.    Approximately 62%, 23% and 36% of our Canadian, U.K., and MillerCoors' workforces, respectively, are represented by trade unions.We believe relations with our employees and those of MillerCoors are good. Stringent labor laws in the U.K. expose us to a greater risk of loss should we experience labor disruptions in that market.Any labor strike, work stoppage or other employee-related issue could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.          Changes to the regulation of the distribution systems for our products could adversely impact our business.    In our U.S. market,there is athree-tier distribution system that has historically applied to the distribution of products now sold through MillerCoors (including our non-U.S. products). That system isincreasingly subject to the legal challenges on the basis that it allegedly interferes with interstate commerce. To the extent that such challenges are successful and require changes to thethree-tier system, such changes could have a materially adverse impact on MillerCoors and, consequently, MCBC. Further, in certain Canadian provinces, our products are distributed throughjoint 17 Table of Contentsventurearrangements that are mandated and regulated by provincial government regulators. If provincial regulation should change, effectively eliminating the distribution channels, the costs to adjustour distribution methods could have a material adverse impact on our business.         Changes in various supply chain standards or agreements could adversely impact our business.    Our business includes various jointventure and industryagreements which standardize parts of the supply chain system. Examples include the returnable bottle system in Canada, as well as warehousing and customer delivery systems organized under jointventure agreements with other brewers. Any change in these agreements could have a material adverse impact on our business.          Because of our reliance on third-party service providers for certain administrative functions, we could experience a disruption to our business.    Werely exclusively on one information services provider worldwide for our information technology functions including network, help desk, hardware, and software configuration. We also have outsourced asignificant portion of work associated with our finance and accounting, human resources, and other information technology functions to a third-party service provider. If one of these service providerswere to fail and we were unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner, we could be unable to properly administer our outsourced functions.          We may incur impairments of the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives.    Inconnection withvarious business combinations, we have allocated material amounts of the related purchase prices to goodwill and other intangible assets that are considered to have indefinite useful lives. Theseassets are tested for impairment at least annually, using estimates and assumptions affected by factors such as economic and industry conditions and changes in operating performance. Potentialresulting charges could be material and could adversely impact our results of operations.          Climate change and water availability may negatively affect our business.    There is concern that a gradual increase in globalaverage temperaturescould cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. While warmer weather has historically been associated withincreased sales of beer, changing weather patterns could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions which may limit availability or increase the cost of key agriculturalcommodities, such as hops, barley and other cereal grains, which are important ingredients for our products. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair productioncapabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. In addition, public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportationand raw material costs and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term, material adverseimpact on our business and results of operations. There are also water availability risks. Climate change may cause water scarcity and a deterioration of water quality in areas where we maintainbrewing operations. The competition for water among domestic, agricultural and manufacturing users is increasing in some of our brewing communities. Even where water is widely available, waterpurification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain our operations.  Risks Specific to the Canada Segment           We may experience continued discounting in Canada.    The continuation, or the increase of such discounting, in Ontario,Québec, Albertaor other provinces, could adversely impact our business.  Risks Specific to the U.S. Segment and MillerCoors           We do not fully control the operations and administration of MillerCoors, which represents our interests in the U.S. beer business.    We jointlycontrol MillerCoors with SABMiller, and hold a 42% economic 18 Table of Contentsinterest.MillerCoors management is responsible for the day to day operations of the business and therefore, we do not have full control over the activities of MillerCoors. Our results of operationsare dependent upon the efforts of MillerCoors management, our ability to govern the joint venture effectively with SABMiller, and factors beyond our control that may affect SABMiller. Additionally,our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to MillerCoors are necessarily substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries.          We may incur unexpected costs or face other business issues from MillerCoors due to challenges associated with integrating operations, technologies, and other aspects of theoperations.    MillerCoors management team continues to focus on fully integrating ours and SABMiller's U.S. operations, technologies, and services, as well as thedistribution networks including the resolution of disputes arising from the consolidation of distributors arising from the MillerCoors joint venture. The failure of MillerCoors to successfullyintegrate the two operations could adversely affect our financial results or prospects.          MillerCoors is highly dependent on independent distributors in the United States to sell its products, with no assurance that these distributors will effectively sell its and ourproducts.    MillerCoors sells all of its products and our non-U.S. products in the United States to distributors for resale to retail outlets and theregulatory environment of many states makes it very difficult to change distributors. Consequently, if MillerCoors is not allowed or is unable to replace unproductive or inefficient distributors,their business, financial position, and results of operation may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.  Risks Specific to the United Kingdom Segment           A failure to successfully implement SAP, as our integrated accounting/ financial reporting and logistics management systems (including those within our Tradeteam partner) in ourU.K.segment in mid 2011 couldadversely affect our ability to effectively manage our customer order and production planning processes, as well as to report results in a timely and accuratemanner.    In mid 2011, we plan to implement SAP and new related processes for all our general ledger accounting and transaction activities, as well our logistics andproduction planning processes. Some companies have experienced startup difficulties with similar projects. If our contingency plans fail, we face certain risks when the system is implemented,including the ability to operate cost-effectively, deliver on customer orders, collect cash from sales and report the results of operations. Additionally, we may not achieve the benefitswe expect from these re-engineered processes.         Sales volume trends in the United Kingdom brewing industry reflect movement from on-premise channels to off-premise channels, a trend which unfavorably impactsour profitability.    In recent years, beer volume sales in the U.K. have been shifting from pubs and restaurants (on-premise) to retail stores(off-premise), for the industry in general. A ban on smoking in pubs and restaurants across the whole of the U.K. enacted in 2007 accelerated this trend. Margins on sales tooff-premise customers tend to be lower than margins on sales to on-premise customers, and, as a result, continuation or acceleration of these trends would further adverselyimpact our profitability.         Consolidation of pubs and growth in the size of pub chains in the United Kingdom could unfavorably impact pricing.    The trendtoward consolidation ofpubs, away from independent pub and club operations, is continuing in the United Kingdom. These larger entities have stronger price negotiating power, and therefore continuation of this trend couldimpact our ability to obtain favorable pricing in the on-premise channel (due to the spillover effect of reduced negotiating leverage) and could reduce our revenues and profit margins. Inaddition, these larger customers continue to move to purchasing directly more of the products that, in the past, we have provided as part of our factored business. Further consolidation couldcontribute to an adverse financial impact. 19 Table of Contents         In the event that a significant pub chain were to go bankrupt, or experience similar financial difficulties, our business could be adverselyimpacted.    We extend credit to pub chains in the U.K., and in some cases the amounts are significant. The continuing challenging economic environment in the U.K.has caused business at on-premise outlets to slow since late 2008, and some pub chains may face increasing financial difficulty if economic conditions do not improve. In the event that apub chain were to be unable to pay amounts owed to the Company as a result of bankruptcy or similar financial difficulties, our business could be adversely impacted.          We depend exclusively on one logistics provider in England, Wales, and Scotland for distribution of our U.K. products.    Tradeteamhandles all of thephysical distribution for us in England, Wales and Scotland, except where a different distribution system is requested by a customer. If Tradeteam were unable to continue distribution of our productsand we were unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner, we could experience significant disruptions in our business that could have an adverse financial impact.  Risks Specific to Our Discontinued Operations           Indemnities provided to the purchaser of 83% of the Cervejarias Kaiser Brasil S.A.

             The reader should carefully consider the following factors and the other information contained within this document. The most importantfactors that could influence the achievement of our goals, and cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to, thefollowing:  Risks Specific to Our Company           If Pentland and the Coors Trust do not agree on a matter submitted to stockholders, generally the matter will not be approved, even if beneficial to us or favored by otherstockholders.    Pentland Securities (a company controlled by Eric Molson, a related party) (""Pentland"") and the Coors Trust, which together control more thantwo-thirds of our Class A common stock and Class A exchangeable shares, have voting trust agreements through which they have combined their voting power over the shares ofour Class A common stock and the Class A exchangeable shares that they own. In the event that these two stockholders do not agree to vote in favor of a matter submitted to a stockholdervote (other than the election of directors), the voting trustees will be required to vote all of the Class A common stock and Class A exchangeable shares deposited in the voting trustsagainst the matter. There is no other mechanism in the voting trust agreements to resolve a potential deadlock between these stockholders. Therefore, if either Pentland or the Coors Trust is unwillingto vote in favor of a transaction that is subject to a stockholder vote, we would be unable to complete the transaction even if our board, management or other stockholders believe the transaction isbeneficial for Molson Coors.          Our success as an enterprise depends largely on the success of relatively few products in several mature markets; the failure or weakening of one or more of these products ormarketscould materially adversely affect our financial results.    The combination of the Canadian and  Coors Lightbrands represented more than 53% of our Canada segment's sales volume in 2008. Similarly, MillerCoors is dependent on  Miller Lite and Coors Light inthe U.S. Carlinglager is the best-selling brand in the United Kingdom and represented more than 80% of our U.K. segment sales volume in 2008. Consequently, any material shift in consumer preferences awayfrom these brands, or from the categories in which they compete, would have a disproportionately large adverse impact on our business. Moreover, each of our major markets is mature, and in each weface large competitors who have greater financial, marketing, and distribution resources and are more diverse in terms of their geographies and brand portfolios.          Poor investment performance of pension plan holdings and other factors impacting pension plan costs could unfavorably impact liquidity and results ofoperations.    Our costs of providing defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on the plans' assets, discountrates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, exchange rate fluctuations, future government regulation, and our required and/or voluntarycontributions made to the plans. While we comply with the minimum funding requirements, we have certain qualified pension plans with obligations which exceed the value of the plans' assets. The recentsignificant worldwide decline in equity prices and in the value of other financial investments, together with unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements, has significantly increased our pensionliabilities. Without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans' assets and depending upon the other factors as listed above, we could be required to fundthe plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on our cash flows, credit rating and cost of borrowing, financial position, or results ofoperations.          We rely on a small number of suppliers to obtain the packaging we need to operate our business. The inability to obtain materials could unfavorably affect our ability to produceourproducts.    We purchase certain types of packaging materials from a small number of suppliers. This packaging (including aluminum cans, aluminum can sheet, glassbottles and paperboard) is unique and is produced by a limited number of suppliers. Consolidation of the packaging materials suppliers has reduced local 21 Table of Contentssupplyalternatives and increased risks of supply disruptions. The inability of any of these suppliers to meet our production requirements, or those of MillerCoors, without sufficient time to developan alternative source could have a material adverse effect on our business.         Consolidation of brewers worldwide may lead to the termination of one or more manufacturer/distribution agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness.    We manufacture and/or distribute products of other beverage companies, including those of one or more competitors, through various licensing,distribution or other arrangements in Canada and the United Kingdom. Beer industry consolidation may increase the competitive environment, straining our current and future relationships with ourpartners. The loss of one or more of these arrangements could have a material adverse effect on the results of one or more reporting segments.         Because we will continue to face intense global competition, operating results may be unfavorably impacted.    The brewing industryis highlycompetitive and requires substantial human and capital resources. Competition in our markets could require us to reduce prices or increase capital and other expenditures or cause us to lose salesvolume, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, in some of our markets, our primary competitors have substantially greater financial,marketing, production and distribution resources than Molson Coors has. In all of the markets in which Molson Coors operates, aggressive marketing strategies by our main competitors could adverselyaffect our financial results.         We may not properly execute, or realize the anticipated $250 million of cost savings or benefits from, our ongoing strategic initiatives.    Oursuccess is partly dependent upon properly executing and realizing cost savings or other benefits from the additional cost savings initiatives identified during 2007. These initiatives are primarilydesigned to make the company more efficient across the whole of the business, which is a necessity in our highly competitive industry. These initiatives are often complex, and a failure to implementthem properly may, in addition to not meeting projected cost savings or benefits, result in a strain on the company's sales, manufacturing, logistics, customer service, or finance and accountingfunctions. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on the business and financial results of the company.          Changes in tax, environmental or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing, trade and other regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financialcondition.    Our business is highly regulated by federal, state, provincial, and local laws and regulations in various countries regarding such matters as licensingrequirements, trade and pricing practices, labeling, advertising, promotion and marketing practices, relationships with distributors, environmental matters, smoking bans at on-premiselocations, and other matters. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations or changes in these laws and regulations or in tax, environmental, excise tax levels imposed or any other laws orregulations could result in the loss, revocation or suspension of our licenses, permits or approvals and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results ofoperations. Additionally, the combination of the Miller and Coors businesses may expose Molson Coors to regulatory risk arising from the legacy Miller portfolio.          Our consolidated financial statements are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, most significantly the British pound (""GBP"") and the Canadian dollar(""CAD"").    We hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in different currencies, most significantly in Canada and in the United Kingdom.Since our financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars (""USD""), we must translate our assets, liabilities, income and expenses into USD at current exchange rates. Increases and decreases in thevalue of the USD will affect, perhaps adversely, the value of these items in our financial statements, even if their local currency value has not changed. We have active hedging programs to addressforeign exchange rate changes. However, to the extent that we fail to adequately manage these risks, including if our hedging arrangements do not effectively or completely hedge changes in foreigncurrency rates, our results of operations may be adversely impacted. 22 Table of Contents         Our operations face significant commodity price change exposure which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.    We use a largevolume of agricultural and other raw materials to produce our products, including barley, barley malt, hops, corn, other various starches, water, and packaging materials, including aluminum, cardboardand other paper products. We also use a significant amount of diesel fuel in our operations. The supply and price of these raw materials and commodities can be affected by a number of factors beyondour control, including market demand, global geopolitical events (especially as to their impact on crude oil prices and the resulting impact on diesel fuel prices), frosts, droughts and other weatherconditions, economic factors affecting growth decisions, plant diseases, and theft. To the extent any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of ingredients or packaging, our results of operationscould be materially and adversely impacted. We have active hedging programs to address commodity price changes. However, to the extent we fail to adequately manage these risks, including if ourhedging arrangements do not effectively or completely hedgechanges in commodity price risks, including price risk associated with diesel fuel and aluminum, our results of operations may be adversely impacted.          We could be adversely affected by overall declines in the beer market.    Consumer trends in some global markets indicate increasesin consumerpreference for wine and spirits, as well as for lower priced, value segment beer brands, which could result in loss of volume or a deterioration of operating margins.          The success of our business relies heavily on brand image, reputation, and product quality. Deterioration to our brand equity may have a material effect on our operations andfinancialresults.    It is important we have the ability to maintain and increase the image and reputation of our existing products. The image and reputation of our productsmay be reduced in the future; concerns about product quality, even when unsubstantiated, could be harmful to our image and reputation of our products. Restoring the image and reputation of ouroperations may be costly; operations and financial results may be adversely impacted.          Due to a high concentration of unionized workers in the United Kingdom, Canada and at MillerCoors in the U.S., we could be significantly affected by labor strikes, work stoppages,orother employee-related issues.    Approximately 63%, 29% and 33% of the Molson, CBL and MillerCoors workforces, respectively, are represented by trade unions.Although we believe relations with our employees and the MillerCoors employees are good, stringent labor laws in the U.K. expose us to a greater risk of loss should we experience labor disruptions inthat market.          Changes to the regulation of the distribution systems for our products could adversely impact our business.    In 2006, the U.S.Supreme Court ruledthat certain state regulations of interstate wine shipments are unlawful. As a result of this decision, states may alter the three-tier distribution system that has historically applied tothe distribution of products now sold through MillerCoors (including our on-U.S. products). Changes to the three-tier distribution system could have a materially adverse impacton MillerCoors. Further, in certain Canadian provinces, our products are distributed through joint venture arrangements that are mandated and regulated by provincial government regulators. Ifprovincial regulation should change, effectively eliminating the distribution channels, the costs to adjust our distribution methods could have a material adverse impact on our business.          Because of our reliance on third-party service providers for certain administrative functions, we could experience a disruption to our business.    Werely exclusively on one information services provider worldwide for our information technology functions including network, help desk, hardware, and software configuration. Additionally, during thefirst quarter of 2008, we signed a contract with another third-party service provider to outsource a significant portion of work associated with our finance and accounting, human resources, and otherinformation technology functions. We transitioned much of the work to our service provider during 2008, and will continue that process, specifically for HR related activities during the first half of2009. If one of these service providers were to fail and we were unable 23 Table of Contentstofind a suitable replacement in a timely manner, we could be unable to properly administer our information technology systems or other administrative tasks associated with the outsourced functions.          We may incur impairments of the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives.    Inconnection withvarious business combinations, we have allocated material amounts of the related purchase prices to goodwill and other intangible assets that are considered to have indefinite useful lives. Theseassets are tested for impairment at least annually, using estimates and assumptions affected by factors such as economic and industry conditions and changes in operating performance. In Canada, asignificant portion of the purchase price of the 2005 merger between Molson and Coors was allocated to Molson's core brands, which have been assigned an indefinite life. Projected declines in salesvolume or net price realization, or projected increases in costs to produce these brands, could cause an impairment in their value. Further, in the event that the adverse financial impact of currenttrends with respect to our U.K. business continues and is worse than we anticipate, we may be required to record impairment charges. These charges could be material and could adversely impact ourresults of operations.  Risks Specific to Our Discontinued Operations          Indemnities provided to the purchaser of 83% of the Cervejarias Kaiser Brasil S.A. (""Kaiser"") business in Brazil could result in future cash outflows and statement ofoperationscharges.    In 2006, we sold our 83% ownership interest in Kaiser to FEMSA Cerveza S.A. de C.V. (""FEMSA""). The terms of our 2006 agreement require us toindemnify FEMSA for exposures related to certain tax, civil and labor contingencies and certain purchased tax credits. The ultimate resolution of these claims is not underour control, and we cannot predict the outcomes of administrative and judicial proceedings that will occur with regard to these claims. It is possible that we will have to make cash outlays to FEMSAwith regard to these indemnities. These indemnity obligations are recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet in conjunction with the sale, we could incur future statement of operations charges asfacts further develop resulting in changes to our estimates or changes in our assessment of probability of loss on these items. Due to the uncertainty involved in the ultimate outcome and timing ofthese contingencies, significant adjustments to the carrying value of our indemnity liabilities and corresponding statement of operations charges/credits could result in the future.  Risks Specific to the Canada Segment          We may be required to provide funding to the entity that owns the Montréal Canadiens hockey club and certain related entertainment businesses pursuant to the guaranteesgiven to the National Hockey League (""NHL"").    Pursuant to certain guarantees given to the NHL as a minority owner of the MontréalCanadiens professional hockey club (majority ownership was sold by Molson in 2001) and certain related entertainment businesses, Molson may have to provide funding to the Club (joint and severallybased on our 19.9% ownership) to meet its obligations and its operating expenses if the Club cannot meet its obligations under various agreements.         We may experience continued discounting in Canada.    Price discounting in Quebec, especially in the Quebec off-premise channel,negatively impacted ourvolume performance and margins in our Canadian segment in 2008. The continuation, or the increase of such discounting, in Quebec or other in provinces, could further adversely impact our business.  Risks Specific to the U.S. Segment and MillerCoors           We may not realize cost savings and other benefits from MillerCoors due to challenges associated with integrating operations, technologies, sales, and other aspects of theoperations.    The success of MillerCoors will depend in part on the success of the management team in integrating the operations, technologies, and personnel ofMCBC's and SABMiller's former U.S. operations. The failure of MillerCoors to 24 Table of Contentsintegratethe two operations or otherwise realize the anticipated benefits of the joint venture transaction, including the estimated $500 million annual cost savings that we previouslyprojected, could unfavorably impact the results of operations of MillerCoors. In addition, the overall integration of MCBC and SABMiller's respective U.S. operations is a complex undertaking and,accordingly, may result in unanticipated operational problems, expenses and liabilities, and diversion of management's attention.         Thechallenges involved in this integration include the following: integrating successfully the respective Miller and Coors U.S. operations, technologies, products and services;  reducing the costs associated with each company's U.S. operations;   coordinating sales, distribution, and marketing efforts to effectively promote the products of MillerCoors;  preserving distribution, marketing, or other important relationships of the U.S. operations of both Miller and Coors andresolving potential conflicts that may arise;   successful integration of the distributorship structure of the two entities, including the resolution of disputes arisingfrom the consolidation of distributors arising from the MillerCoors joint venture;   coordinating and rationalizing research and development activities to accelerate introduction of new products and otherinnovations;   retaining management, key employees and business partners;   assimilating the personnel and business cultures of both companies; and building employee morale and motivation. Anyadverse financial, operation or other events affecting MillerCoors could adversely affect our financial results or prospects.          We do not fully control the operations and administration of MillerCoors, our investment in which represents our interests in the U.S. beerbusiness.    We jointly control MillerCoors with SABMiller, and hold 42% economic interest in it. MillerCoors management is responsible for the day to day operationsof the business including brewing, distribution, sales, marketing (including the growth and preservation of brand equities), finance, information technology, human resources, legal, technicaloperations, safety, environmental compliance, and relationships with governments. As we do not have full control over the activities of MillerCoors, our results of operations for those ventures aredependent upon the efforts of MillerCoors management, our ability to govern the joint venture effectively with SABMiller, and factors beyond our control that may affect SABMiller. Additionally, ourdisclosure controls and procedures with respect to MillerCoors are necessarily substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries.          MillerCoors is highly dependent on independent distributors in the United States to sell its products, with no assurance that these distributors will effectively sell its and ourproducts.    MillerCoors sells all of its products and our non-U.S. products in the United States to distributors for resale to retail outlets. Some ofthese distributors are at a competitive disadvantage because they are smaller than the largest distributors in their markets. In addition, the regulatory environment of many states makes it verydifficult to change distributors. Consequently, if MillerCoors is not allowed or is unable to replace unproductive or inefficient distributors, their business, financial position, and results ofoperation may be adversely affected. Consolidation of distributors is expected to occur following the formation of MillerCoors. The current state of the financial and credit markets may make it moredifficult for consolidation among distributors to occur. 25 Table of Contents Risks Specific to the United Kingdom Segment           Sales volume trends in the United Kingdom brewing industry reflect movement from on-premise channels to off-premise channels, a trend which unfavorably impactsour profitability.    In recent years, beer volume sales in the U.K. have been shifting from pubs and restaurants (on-premise) to retail stores(off-premise), for the industry in general. A ban on smoking in pubs and restaurants across the whole of the U.K. enacted in 2007 accelerated this trend. Margins on sales tooff-premise customers tend to be lower than margins on sales to on-premise customers, and, as a result, continuation of these trends would further adversely impact ourprofitability.          In the event that a significant pub chain were to go bankrupt, or experience similar financial difficulties, our business could be adverselyimpacted.    We extend credit to pub chains in the U.K. in which some cases the amounts are significant. The continuing challenging economic environment in the U.K.has caused business at on-premise outlets to slow in late 2008 and early 2009, and some pub chains may face increasing financial difficulty if economic conditions do not improve. In the event that apub chain were to be unable to pay amounts owed to the Company as a result of bankruptcy or similar financial difficulties, our business could be adversely impacted.          Consolidation of pubs and growth in the size of pub chains in the United Kingdom could unfavorably impact pricing.    The trendtoward consolidation ofpubs, away from independent pub and club operations, is continuing in the United Kingdom. These larger entities have stronger price negotiating power, and therefore continuation of this trend couldimpact CBL's ability to obtain favorable pricing in the on-premise channel (due to the spillover effect of reduced negotiating leverage) and could reduce our revenues andprofit margins. In addition, these larger customers continue to move to purchasing directly more of the products that, in the past, we have provided as part of our factored business. Furtherconsolidation could contribute to an adverse financial impact.          We depend exclusively on one logistics provider in England, Wales, and Scotland for distribution of our CBL products.    Tradeteamhandles all of thephysical distribution for CBL in England, Wales and Scotland, except where a different distribution system is requested by a customer. If Tradeteam were unable to continue distribution of our productsand we were unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner, we could experience significant disruptions in our business that could have an adverse financial impact"
8,TAP,MOLSON COORS BREWING CO,2008-02-22,"ITEM 1A.    Risk Factors
             The reader should carefully consider the following factors and the other information contained within this document. The most important factors that couldinfluence the achievement of our goals, 18 andcause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to, the following: Risks Specific to Our Company          If Pentland and the Coors Trust do not agree on a matter submitted to stockholders, generally the matter will not be approved, even ifbeneficial to us or favored by other stockholders.    Pentland Securities (a company controlled by Eric Molson, a related party) (""Pentland"") and the Coors Trust,which together control more than two-thirds of our Class A common stock and Class A exchangeable shares, have voting trust agreements through which they have combined theirvoting power over the shares of our Class A common stock and the Class A exchangeable shares that they own. In the event that these two stockholders do not agree to vote in favor of amatter submitted to a stockholder vote (other than the election of directors), the voting trustees will be required to vote all of the Class A common stock and Class A exchangeableshares deposited in the voting trusts against the matter. There is no other mechanism in the voting trust agreements to resolve a potential deadlock between these stockholders.Therefore, if either Pentland or the Coors Trust is unwilling to vote in favor of a transaction that is subject to a stockholder vote, we would be unable to complete the transaction even if our board,management or other stockholders believe the transaction is beneficial for Molson Coors.         Our success as an enterprise depends largely on the success of three primary products in three mature markets; the failure or weakening ofone or more of these products or markets could materially adversely affect our financial results.    The combination of the Molson Canadian and Coors Light brandsrepresented more than 44% of our Canada segment's sales volume in 2007. Although we currently have 14 products in our U.S. portfolio, Coors Light represented more than 66% of our U.S. segment's salesvolume for 2007. Carling lager is the best-selling brand in the United Kingdom and represented more than 78% of our European segment's sales volume in 2007. Consequently, any materialshift in consumer preferences away from these brands, or from the categories in which they compete, would have a disproportionately large adverse impact on our business. Moreover, each of our threemajor markets is mature, and in each we face large competitors who have greater financial, marketing, and distribution resources and are more diverse in terms of their geographies and brandportfolios.         Poor investment performance of pension plan holdings and other factors impacting pension plan costs could unfavorably impact liquidity andresults of operations.    Our costs of providing defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on the plans'assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation, and our required and/or voluntary contributions madeto the plans. While we comply with the minimum funding requirements, we have certain qualified pension plans with obligations which exceeded the value of the plans' assets. Without sustained growth inthe pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans' assets and depending upon the other factors as listed above, we could be required to fund the plans with significant amounts ofcash. Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on our cash flows, financial position, or results of operations.         We rely on a small number of suppliers to obtain the packaging we need to operate our business. The inability to obtain materials couldunfavorably affect our ability to produce our products.    For our U.S. business, we purchase most of our paperboard and container supplies from a single supplier ora small number of suppliers. This packaging is unique and is not produced by any other supplier. Additionally, we are contractually obligated to purchase substantially all our can and bottle needs inthe United States and Canada from our container joint ventures or from our partners in those ventures, Ball Corporation (RMMC) and Owens-Brockway Glass Container, Inc. (RMBC). Consolidation ofthe glass bottle industry in North America has reduced local supply alternatives and increased risks of glass bottle supply disruptions. CBL has a single source for its can supply (Ball). Theinability of any of these 19 suppliersto meet our production requirements without sufficient time to develop an alternative source could have a material adverse effect on our business.         Our United States and Europe production is concentrated among a small number of production facilities, so we could be more vulnerable thanour competitors to transportation disruptions, fuel increases and naturaldisasters.    In the United States and Europe, respectively, we have primary production facilities in Golden, Colorado and Burton-on-Trent,England. In both segments, our competitors are more geographically dispersed. As a result, we ship our products greater distances than some of our competitors, making us more vulnerable tofluctuations in costs such as fuel, as well as the impact of any localized natural disasters impacting these two facilities. During 2007, we brought on-line our Shenandoah brewery locatedin Elkton, Virginia to reduce risk in the United States segment associated with having a significant single site production facility.         Consolidation of brewers worldwide may lead to the termination of one or more manufacturer/distribution agreements, which could have amaterial adverse effect on our business.    We manufacture and/or distribute products of other beverage companies, including those of one or more competitors, throughvarious licensing, distribution or other arrangements in Canada and the United Kingdom. Beer industry consolidation may increase the competitive environment, straining our current and futurerelationships with our partners. The loss of one or more of these arrangements could have a material adverse effect on the results of one or more reporting segments.         Because we will continue to face intense global competition, operating results may be unfavorably impacted.    The brewing industry is highly competitive and requires substantial human and capital resources. Competition in our markets could require us to reduce prices or increase capital andother expenditures or cause us to lose sales volume, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, in some of our markets, our primarycompetitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, production and distribution resources than Molson Coors has. In all of the markets in which Molson Coors operates, aggressive marketingstrategies by our main competitors could adversely affect our financial results.         We may not properly execute, or realize the anticipated $250 million of cost savings or benefits from, our ongoing strategicinitiatives.    Our success is partly dependent upon properly executing and realizing cost savings or other benefits from the additional cost savings initiativesidentified during 2007. These initiatives are primarily designed to make the company more efficient across the whole of the business, which is a necessity in our highly competitive industry. Theseinitiatives are often complex, and a failure to implement them properly may, in addition to not meeting projected cost savings or benefits, result in a strain on the company's sales, manufacturing,logistics, customer service, or finance and accounting functions. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on the business and financial results of the company.         Changes in tax, environmental or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing, trade and other regulations could have amaterial adverse effect on our financial condition.    Our business is highly regulated by federal, state, provincial, and local laws and regulations in variouscountries regarding such matters as licensing requirements, trade and pricing practices, labeling, advertising, promotion and marketing practices, relationships with distributors, environmentalmatters, smoking bans at on-premise locations, and other matters. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations or changes in these laws and regulations or in tax, environmental,excise tax levels imposed or any other laws or regulations could result in the loss, revocation or suspension of our licenses, permits or approvals and could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.         Our consolidated financial statements are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, most significantly the British pound (""GBP"")and the Canadian dollar (""CAD"").    We hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in different currencies, most significantly in Canada and in 20 theUnited Kingdom. Since our financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars (""USD""), we must translate our assets, liabilities, income and expenses into USD at current exchange rates. Increasesand decreases in the value of the USD will affect, perhaps adversely, the value of these items in our financial statements, even if their local currency value has not changed. We have active hedgingprograms to address foreign exchange rate changes. However, to the extent that we fail to adequately manage the foregoing risks, including if our hedging arrangements do not effectively or completelyhedge changes in foreign currency rates, our results of operations may be adversely impacted.         Our operations face significant commodity price change exposure which could materially and adversely affect our operatingresults.    We use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials to produce our products, including barley, barley malt, hops, corn, other various starches,water, and packaging materials, including aluminum, cardboard and other paper products. We also use a significant amount of diesel fuel in our operations. The supply and price of these raw materialsand commodities can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including market demand, global geopolitical events (especially as to their impact on crude oil prices and the resultingimpact on diesel fuel prices), frosts, droughts and other weather conditions, economic factors affecting growth decisions, plant diseases, and theft. To the extent any of the foregoing factors affectthe prices of ingredients or packaging, our results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted. We have active hedging programs to address commodity price changes. However, to the extentwe fail to adequately manage the foregoing risks, including if our hedging arrangements do not effectively or completely hedge changes in commodity price risks, including price risk associated withdiesel fuel and aluminum, both of which are at historically high price levels, our results of operations may be adversely impacted.         We could be adversely affected by overall declines in the beer market.    Consumer trends in some globalmarkets indicate increases in consumer preference for wine and spirits, as well as for lower priced, value segment beer brands, which could result in loss of volume or a deterioration of operatingmargins.         The success of our business relies heavily on brand image, reputation, and product quality. Deterioration to our brand equity may have amaterial effect to our operations and financial results.    It is important we have the ability to maintain and increase the image and reputation of our existingproducts. The image and reputation of our products may be reduced in the future; concerns about product quality, even when unsubstantiated, could be harmful to our image and reputation of ourproducts. Restoring the image and reputation of our operations may be costly; operations and financial results may be adversely impacted.         Due to a high concentration of unionized workers in the United Kingdom and Canada, we could be significantly affected by labor strikes,work stoppages, or other employee-related issues.    Approximately 63% ofMolson's total workforce and approximately 21% of CBL's total workforce is represented by trade unions. Although we believe relations with our employees are good, stringent labor lawsin the U.K. expose us to a greater risk of loss should we experience labor disruptions in that market.         Changes to the regulation of the distribution systems for our products could adversely impact ourbusiness.    In 2006, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that certain state regulations of interstate wine shipments are unlawful. As a result of this decision, states mayalter the three-tier distribution system that has historically applied to the distribution of our products. Changes to the three-tier distribution system could have amaterially adverse impact on our business. Further, in certain Canadian provinces, our products are distributed through joint venture arrangements that are mandated and regulated by provincialgovernment regulators. If provincial regulation should change, effectively eliminating the distribution channels, the costs to adjust our distribution methods could have a material adverse impact onour business. 21         Because of our reliance on third-party service providers for certain administrative functions, we could experience a disruption to ourbusiness.    We rely exclusively on one information services provider worldwide for our information technology functions including network, help desk, hardware, andsoftware configuration Additionally, during the first quarter of 2008, we signed a contract with another third-party service provider to outsource a significant portion of work associated with ourfinance and accounting, human resources, and other information technology functions. We will begin transitioning work to our service provider in the first half of 2008, and the transition willcontinue through the end of the year. If one of these service providers were to fail and we were unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner, we could be unable to properly administer ourinformation technology systems or other administrative tasks associated with the outsourced functions. Risks Specific to Our Discontinued Operations          Indemnities provided to the purchaser of 83% of the Cervejarias Kaiser Brasil S.A. (""Kaiser"") business in Brazil could result infuture cash outflows and statement of operations charges.    In 2006, we sold our 83% ownership interest in Kaiser to FEMSA Cerveza S.A. de C.V. (""FEMSA""). Theterms of our 2006 agreement require us to indemnify FEMSA for exposures related to certain tax, civil and labor contingencies and certain purchased tax credits. The ultimate resolution of these claimsis not under our control, and we cannot predict the outcomes of administrative and judicial proceedings that will occur with regard to these claims. It is possible that we will have to make cashoutlays to FEMSA with regard to these indemnities. While the fair values of these indemnity obligations are recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet in conjunction with the sale, we could incurfuture statement ofoperations charges as facts further develop resulting in changes to our fair value estimates or changes in our assessment of probability of loss on these items. Due to the uncertainty involved in theultimate outcome and timing of these contingencies, significant adjustments to the carrying value of our indemnity liabilities and corresponding statement of operations charges/credits could result inthe future. Risks Specific to the Canada Segment          We may be required to provide funding to the entity that owns the Montréal Canadiens hockey club and certain relatedentertainment businesses pursuant to the guarantees given to the National Hockey League (""NHL"").    Pursuant to certain guarantees given to the NHL asa minority owner of the Montréal Canadiens professional hockey club (majority ownership was sold by Molson in 2001) and certain related entertainment businesses, Molson may have toprovide funding to the Club (joint and severally based on our 19.9% ownership) to meet its obligations and its operating expenses if the Club cannot meet its obligations under various agreements. Risks Specific to the U.S. Segment          The proposed MillerCoors joint venture transaction is subject to the receipt of consents and approvals from government entities that coulddelay or prevent completion of the venture transaction or impose conditions on the venture, which could result in a material adverse effect on the business or financial condition of the joint ventureas well as on our business and financial results.    Completion of the joint venture transaction is conditioned upon the expiration or termination of the applicablewaiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, and the approval of the transaction by certain other regulatory authorities. If such regulatory clearances are not obtained, we will not beable to complete the transaction, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, a substantial delay in obtaining satisfactory approvals or theimposition of unfavorable terms or conditions in the approvals could have a material adverse effect on the business and financial results of the joint venture as well as on our business and financialresults. 22         We may not realize the cost savings and other benefits we currently anticipate from the MillerCoors joint venture transaction due tochallenges associated with integrating operations, technologies, sales, and other aspects of the operations.    The success of the joint venture transaction, ifapproved, will depend in part on the success of the management of the venture in integrating the operations, technologies, and personnel of MCBC's and SABMiller's respective U.S. operations followingthe completion of the transaction. The failure of the venture to integrate the two operations or otherwise to realize the anticipated benefits of the joint venture transaction, including the estimatedannual cost savings described elsewhere in this document, could negatively impact the results of operations of the joint venture. In addition, the overall integration of MCBC and SABMiller'srespective U.S. operations is complex and, accordingly, may result in unanticipated operational problems, expenses and liabilities, and diversion of management's attention.         Thechallenges involved in this integration include the following: integratingsuccessfully each company's U.S. operations, technologies, products and services;reducingthe costs associated with each company's U.S. operations;coordinatingsales, distribution, and marketing efforts to effectively promote the products of the joint venture;preservingdistribution, marketing, or other important relationships of the U.S. operations of both MCBC and SABMiller and resolving potential conflicts that may arise;coordinatingand rationalizing research and development activities to accelerate introduction of new products;assimilatingthe personnel and business cultures of both companies; andbuildingemployee morale and motivation.         We are highly dependent on independent distributors in the United States to sell our products, with no assurance that these distributorswill effectively sell our products.    We sell all of our products in the United States to distributors for resale to retail outlets. Some of our distributors are ata competitive disadvantage because they are smaller than the largest distributors in their markets. Our distributors also sell products that compete with our products. These distributors may give ourcompetitors' products higher priority, thereby reducing sales of our products. In addition, the regulatory environment of many states makes it very difficult to change distributors. Consequently, ifwe are not allowed or are unable to replace unproductive or inefficient distributors, our business, financial position, and results of operation may be adversely affected.         A failure to successfully upgrade certain information technology systems in early 2008 could cause disruption in ourbusiness.    During early 2008, we are upgrading certain modules of key information technology systems in the United States and the United Kingdom. A failure tosuccessfully accomplish these upgrades could adversely affect our ability to take orders, plan and schedule production, ship products, and bill customers for shipments. Risks Specific to the Europe Segment          Sales volume trends in the United Kingdom brewing industry reflect movement from on-premise channels tooff-premise channels, a trend which unfavorably impacts our profitability.    In recent years, beer volume sales in the U.K. have been shifting from pubsand restaurants (on-premise) to retail stores (off-premise), for the industry in general. A ban on smoking in pubs and restaurants across the whole of the U.K. enacted in 2007is accelerating this trend. Margins on sales to off-premise customers tend to be lower than margins on sales to on-premise customers, hence these trends could adversely impactour profitability. 23         Consolidation of pubs and growth in the size of pub chains in the United Kingdom could unfavorably impactpricing.    The trend toward consolidation of pubs, away from independent pub and club operations, is continuing in the United Kingdom. These larger entities havestronger price negotiating power, and therefore continuation of this trend could impact CBL's ability to obtain favorable pricing in the on-premise channel (due to thespillover effect of reduced negotiating leverage) and could reduce our revenues and profit margins. In addition, these larger customers continue to move topurchasing directly more of the products that, in the past, we have provided as part of our factored business. Further consolidation could contribute to an adverse financial impact.         We depend exclusively on one logistics provider in England, Wales, and Scotland for distribution of our CBLproducts.    We are a party to a joint venture with DHL (""Tradeteam""). Tradeteam handles all of the physical distribution for CBL in England, Wales and Scotland,except where a different distribution system is requested by a customer. If Tradeteam were unable to continue distribution of our products and we were unable to find a suitable replacement in a timelymanner, we could experience significant disruptions in our business that could have an adverse financial impact.         We may incur impairments of the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite usefullives.    In connection with various business combinations, we have allocated material amounts of the related purchase prices to goodwill and other intangible assetsthat are considered to have indefinite useful lives. These assets are tested for impairment at least annually, using estimates and assumptions affected by factors such as economic and industryconditions and changes in operating performance. In the event that the adverse financial impact of current trends with respect to our U.K. business continue and are worse than we anticipate, we may berequired to record impairment charges. These charges could be material and could adversely impact our results of operations"
5,TAP,MOLSON COORS BREWING CO,2007-03-01,"ITEM 1A.        RiskFactorsThe reader should carefully consider the followingfactors and the other information contained within this document. The mostimportant factors that could influence the achievement of our goals, and causeactual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-lookingstatements, include, but are not limited to, the following:Risksspecific to our CompanyIf Pentland and the Coors Trust do not agree on amatter submitted to stockholders, generally the matter will not be approved,even if beneficial to the Company or favored by other stockholders.   Pentland and the Coors Trust, which togethercontrol more than two-thirds of the Companys Class A Common andExchangeable stock, have voting trust agreements through which they havecombined their voting power over the shares of our Class A common stockand the Class A exchangeable shares that they own. However, in the eventthat these two stockholders do not agree to vote in favor of a matter submittedto a stockholder vote (other than the election of directors), the votingtrustees will be required to vote all of the Class A common stock and Class Aexchangeable shares deposited in the voting trusts against the matter. There isno other mechanism in the voting trust agreements to resolve a potentialdeadlock between these stockholders. Therefore, if either Pentland or the CoorsTrust is unwilling to vote in favor of a transaction that is subject to astockholder vote, we may be unable to complete the transaction even if ourboard, management or other stockholders believe the transaction is beneficialfor Molson Coors.Our success as an enterprise depends largely on thesuccess of three primary products in three mature markets; the failure orweakening of one or more could materially adversely affect our financialresults.   Although we currently have 14 products inour U.S. portfolio, Coors Light represented more than 71% of our U.S. segmentssales volume for 2006. Carling lager is the best-selling brand in the UnitedKingdom and represented more than 77% of our European segments sales volume in2006. The combination of the Molson Canadian and Coors Light brands representedmore than 42% of our Canada segments sales volume in 2006. Consequently, anymaterial shift in consumer preferences away from these brands, or from thecategories in which they compete, would have a disproportionately large adverseimpact on our business. Moreover, each of our three major markets is mature,and we face large competitors who have greater financial, marketing anddistribution resources and are more diverse in terms of their geographies andbrand portfolios.We have indebtedness that is substantial in relationto our stockholders equity, which could hinder our ability to adjust to rapidchanges in market conditions or to respond to competitive pressures.   As of December 31, 2006, we hadapproximately $850 million in debt primarily related to our acquisition ofCBL and $1.1 billion of debt primarily related to our Merger with Molson.As a result, we must use a portion of our cash flow from operations to payinterest on our debt. If our financial and operating performance does notgenerate sufficient cash flow for all of our activities, our operations couldbe adversely impacted.We rely on a small number of suppliers to obtain thepackaging we need to operate our business. The inability to obtain materialscould unfavorably affect our ability to produce our products.   For our U.S. business, we purchase most of ourpaperboard and container supplies from a single supplier or a small number ofsuppliers. This packaging is unique and is not produced by any other supplier.Additionally, we are 17 contractually obligated to purchase substantially allour can and bottle needs in the United States and Canada from our containerjoint ventures or from our partners in those ventures, Ball Corporation (RMMC)and Owens-Brockway Glass Container, Inc. (RMBC). Consolidation ofthe glass bottle industry in North America has reduced local supplyalternatives and increased risks of glass bottle supply disruptions. CBL has asingle source for its can supply (Ball). The inability of any of thesesuppliers to meet our production requirements without sufficient time todevelop an alternative source could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness.Our primary production facilities in Europe and theUnited States are located at single sites, so we could be more vulnerable thanour competitors to transportation disruptions, fuel increases and naturaldisasters.   Our primary production facility in the UnitedStates is in Golden, Colorado, and in Europe, our primary production facilityis located in Burton-on-Trent, England. In both segments, our competitors havemultiple geographically dispersed breweries and packaging facilities. As aresult, we must ship our products greater distances than some of ourcompetitors, making us more vulnerable to fluctuations in costs such as fuel,as well as the impact of any localized natural disasters should they occur.The termination of one or moremanufacturer/distribution agreements could have a material adverse effect onour business.   We manufactureand/or distribute products of other beverage companies, including those of oneor more competitors, through various licensing, distribution or otherarrangements in Canada and the United Kingdom. The loss of one or more of thesearrangements could have a material adverse effect on the results of one or morereporting segments.Because we will continue to face intense globalcompetition, operating results may be unfavorably impacted.   Thebrewing industry is highly competitive and requires substantial human andcapital resources. Competition in our various markets could cause us to reduceprices, increase capital and other expenditures or lose sales volume, any ofwhich could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.In addition, in some of our markets, our primary competitors have substantiallygreater financial, marketing, production and distribution resources than MolsonCoors has. In all of the markets where Molson Coors operates, aggressivemarketing strategies by our main competitors could adversely affect ourfinancial results.Changes in tax, environmental or other regulations orfailure to comply with existing licensing, trade and other regulations couldhave a material adverse effect on our financial condition.   Our business is highly regulated by federal,state, provincial and local laws and regulations in various countries regardingsuch matters as licensing requirements, trade and pricing practices, labeling,advertising, promotion and marketing practices, relationships withdistributors, environmental matters, smoking bans at on-premise locations andother matters. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could resultin the loss, revocation or suspension of our licenses, permits or approvals. Inaddition, changes in tax, environmental or any other laws or regulations couldhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and resultsof operations.Our consolidated financial statements are subject tofluctuations in foreign exchange rates, most significantly the British poundand the Canadian dollar.   We hold assets and incur liabilities, earnrevenues and pay expenses in different currencies, most significantly in Canadaand in the United Kingdom. Since our financial statements are presented in USD,we must translate our assets, liabilities, income and expenses into USD atcurrent exchange rates. Increases and decreases in the value of the USD willaffect, perhaps adversely, the value of these items in our financialstatements, even if their local currency value has not changed.Our operations face significant commodity price changeand foreign exchange rate exposure which could materially and adversely affectour operating results.   We use a large volume of agricultural andother raw materials to produce our products, including barley, barley malt,hops, various starches, water and packaging materials, including aluminum andpaper products. We also use a significant amount of diesel 18 fuel in our operations. The supply and price of theseraw materials and commodities can be affected by a number of factors beyond ourcontrol, including market demand, global geo-political events (especially as totheir impact on crude oil prices and the resulting impact on diesel fuelprices), frosts, droughts and other weather conditions, economic factorsaffecting growth decisions, plant diseases and theft. To the extent any of theforegoing factors affect the prices of ingredients or packaging, our results ofoperations could be materially and adversely impacted. We have active hedgingprograms to address commodity price and foreign exchange rate changes. However,to the extent we fail to adequately manage the foregoing risks, including ifour hedging arrangements do not effectively or completely hedge changes inforeign currency rates or commodity price risks, including price riskassociated with diesel fuel and aluminum, both of which are at historicallyhigh price levels, our results of operations may be adversely impacted.We could be adversely affected by overall declines inthe beer market.   Consumertrends in some global markets indicate increases in consumer preference forwine and spirits, as well as for lower priced, value segment beer brands in someCanadian markets, which could result in loss of volume or a deterioration ofoperating margins.Because of our reliance on a single informationtechnology service supplier, we could experience significant disruption to ourbusiness.   We rely exclusively on one informationtechnology services provider worldwide for our network, help desk, hardware andsoftware configuration. If that service provider fails and we are unable tofind a suitable replacement in a timely manner, we could be unable to properlyadminister our information technology systems.Due to a high concentration of unionized workers inthe United Kingdom and Canada, we could be significantly affected by laborstrikes, work stoppages or other employee-related issues.   Approximately 67% of Molsons total workforceand approximately 23% of CBLs total workforce is represented by trade unions.Although we believe relations with our employees are good, stringent labor lawsin the United Kingdom expose us to a greater risk of loss should we experiencelabor disruptions in that market.Changes to theregulation of the distribution systems for our products could adversely impactour business.   In 2006, the U.S.Supreme Court ruled that certain state regulations of interstate wine shipmentsare unlawful. As a result of this decision, states may alter the three-tierdistribution system that has historically applied to the distribution of ourproducts. Changes to the three-tier distribution system could have a materiallyadverse impact on our business. Further, in certain Canadian provinces, ourproducts are distributed through joint venture arrangements that are mandatedand regulated by provincial government regulators. If provincial regulationshould change, effectively eliminating the distribution channels, the costs toadjust our distribution methods could have a material adverse impact on ourbusiness.Risksspecific to our Discontinued OperationsIndemnitiesprovided to the purchaser of 83% of the Kaiser business in Brazil could resultin future cash outflows and statement of operations charges.   On January 13, 2006, we agreed to sell a68% equity interest in Kaiser to FEMSA for $68 million cash, including theassumption by FEMSA of Kaiser-related debt and certain contingencies. In November 2006,we divested our remaining 15% ownership interest in Kaiser and received $15.7million, resulting in an increase of FEMSAs purchased ownership of Kaiser to83%. The terms of our 2006 agreement require us to indemnify FEMSA forexposures related to certain tax, civil and labor contingencies and certainpurchased tax credits. The ultimate resolution of these claims is not under ourcontrol, and we cannot predict the outcomes of administrative and judicialproceedings that will occur with regard to these claims. It is possible that wewill have to make cash outlays to FEMSA with regard to these indemnities. Whilethe fair values of these indemnity obligations are recorded as liabilities onour balance sheet in conjunction with the sale, we could incur future statementof operations charges as facts further develop resulting in changes to our fairvalue estimates or change in assessment of probability of loss on these items.Due to the uncertainty involved in the ultimate outcome and timing of thesecontingencies, significant adjustments to the carrying value of our indemnityliabilities and corresponding statement of operations charges/credits couldresult in the future.19 Risksspecific to the Canada SegmentWe may be required to provide funding to the entitythat owns the Montréal Canadiens hockey club and the related entertainmentbusiness pursuant to the guarantees given to the National Hockey League (NHL).   Pursuant to certain guarantees given to theNHL as a minority owner of the entertainment business and the MontréalCanadiens professional hockey club (majority ownership sold by Molson in 2001),Molson may have to provide funding to the Club (joint and severally based onour 19.9% ownership) to meet its obligations and its operating expenses if theClub cannot meet its obligations under various agreements.An adverse result in a lawsuit brought by Miller couldhave an adverse impact on our business.   InDecember 2005, Miller Brewing Company sued the Company and several subsidiariesin a Wisconsin federal court. Miller seeks to invalidate a licensing agreementallowing Molson Canada the sole distribution of Miller products in Canada.Miller claims U.S. and Canadian antitrust violations and violations of theAgreements confidentiality provisions. Miller also claims that the Agreementspurposes have been frustrated as a result of the Molson Coors Merger. If Millerwere to prevail in this action, it could have an adverse impact on our business,and we may be required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion ofthe $112.0 million carrying value of our intangible asset associated withthe Miller arrangements.If we are unsuccessful in maintaining licensing,distribution and related agreements, our business could suffer adverse effects.   We manufacture and/or distribute products ofother beverage companies in Canada, including those of one or more competitors,through various licensing, distribution or other arrangements. The loss of oneor more of these arrangements could adversely impact our business.If the MaritimeProvinces refuse to recognize our new brewery in Moncton, New Brunswick, as a localbrewer, we will not be able to use that facility as planned.   We are completing a brewery in Moncton,New Brunswick. We decided to build it on the basis of assurances from CanadasMaritime Provinces (which include New Brunswick and Nova Scotia) that thefacility would qualify as a local brewer, under the Maritime Accord so thatbeer shipped to other Maritime Provinces would be subject to much lowerhandling fees than beer shipped from elsewhere in Canada. There is risk thatcertain Maritime Provinces will not honor their previous assurances. If so, ourreturn on investment would be substantially lower than planned, and we may berequired to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of the $25.2 millionspent to construct the brewery.Risksspecific to the U.S. SegmentLitigation directed at the alcohol beverage industrymay adversely affect our sales volumes, our business and our financial results.   Molson Coors and other brewers and distilledspirits manufacturers have been sued in several courts regarding advertisingpractices and underage consumption. The suits allege that each defendantintentionally marketed its products to children and other underage consumers.In essence, each suit seeks, on behalf of an undefined class of parents andguardians, an injunction and unspecified money damages. We will vigorouslydefend these lawsuits, several of which have been dismissed and are now onappeal. It is not possible at this time to estimate the possible loss or rangeof loss, if any, that may result from these lawsuits.We are highlydependent on independent distributors in the United States to sell ourproducts, with no assurance that these distributors will effectively sell ourproducts.   We sell all of our products in the UnitedStates to distributors for resale to retail outlets. Some of our distributorsare at a competitive disadvantage because they are smaller than the largestdistributors in their markets. Our distributors also sell products that competewith our products. These distributors may give our competitors products higherpriority, thereby reducing sales of our products. In addition, the regulatoryenvironment of many states makes it very difficult to change distributors.Consequently, if we are not allowed or are unable to replace unproductive orinefficient distributors, our business, financial position and results ofoperation may be adversely affected.20 Risksspecific to the Europe SegmentSales volume trends in the United Kingdom brewingindustry reflect movement from on-premise channels to off-premise channels, atrend which unfavorably impacts our profitability.   We have noted in recent years that beer volumesales in the U.K. have been shifting from pubs and restaurants (on-premise) toretail stores (off-premise), for the industry in general. The progression to aban on smoking in pubs and restaurants across the whole of the U.K. anticipatedto be effective in 2007 is likely to accelerate this trend. Margins on sales tooff-premise customers tend to be lower than margins on sales to on-premisecustomers, hence these trends could adversely impact our profitability.Consolidation of pubs and growth in the size of pubchains in the United Kingdom could result in less ability to achieve favorablepricing.   The trend toward consolidation of pubs, awayfrom independent pub and club operations, is continuing in the United Kingdom.These larger entities have stronger price negotiating power, and thereforecontinuation of this trend could impact CBLs ability to obtain favorablepricing in the on-premise channel (due to spillover effect of reducednegotiating leverage) and could reduce our revenues and profit margins. Inaddition, these larger customers continue to move to purchasing directly moreof the products that, in the past, we have provided as part of our factoredbusiness. Further consolidation could impact us adversely.We depend exclusively on one logistics provider inEngland, Wales and Scotland for distribution of our CBL products.   Weare a party to a joint venture with DHL called Tradeteam. Tradeteam handles allof the physical distribution for CBL in England, Wales and Scotland, exceptwhere a different distribution system is requested by a customer. If Tradeteamwere unable to continue distribution of our products and we were unable to finda suitable replacement in a timely manner, we could experience significantdisruptions in our business that could have an adverse financial impact.We are reliant on a single third party as a supplierfor kegs in the United Kingdom.   OurCBL business uses kegs managed by a logistics provider who is responsible forproviding an adequate stock of kegs as well as their upkeep. Due to greaterthan anticipated keg losses as well as reduced fill fees (attributable toreduced overall volume), the logistics provider has encountered financialdifficulty. As a result of action taken by the logistics provider's lendinginstitution, related to perceived financial difficulties of the borrower, thelogistics provider has been forced into administration (restructuringproceedings) and the bank, on February 20, 2007, exercised its option toput the keg population to CBL. As a result, we expect to purchase the existingkeg population from the logistics provider's lender at fair value pursuant tothe terms of the agreement between CBL and the logistics providers lender. Weestimate that this potential capital expenditure, which may be financed over aperiod of time in excess of one year, could amount to approximately $70 millionto $100 million, which is not included in the 2007 capital expendituresplan. As a result of this capital requirement, we may reduce other elements ofour 2007 capital expenditures plan, or offset risk posed by the potential kegpurchase through increased cash generation efforts.We may incurimpairments of the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assetsthat have indefinite useful lives.   Inconnection with various business combinations, we have allocated materialamounts of the related purchase prices to goodwill and other intangible assetsthat are considered to have indefinite useful lives. These assets are testedfor impairment at least annually, using estimates and assumptions affected byfactors such as economic and industry conditions and changes in operatingperformance. In the event that the adverse financial impact of current trendswith respect to our U.K. business continue and including the potential impactof an expected smoking ban in on-premise locations across the whole of the U.K.in 2007 are worse than we anticipate, we may be required to record impairmentcharges. This could be material and could adversely impact our results ofoperations"
11,TAP,MOLSON COORS BREWING CO,2006-03-10,"ITEM 1A. Risk Factors
             The reader should carefully consider the following factors and the other information contained within this document. The most important factors that couldinfluence the achievement of our goals, and cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to, the following: Risks specific to the Molson Merger          We may not realize the cost savings and other benefits we currently anticipate due to challenges associated with integrating theoperations, technologies, sales and other aspects of the businesses of Molson and Coors. Our success will depend in large part on management's success in integrating theoperations, technologies and personnel of Molson and Coors. If we fail to integrate the operations of Molson and Coors or otherwise fail to realize any of the anticipated benefits of the Mergertransaction, including the estimated cost savings of approximately $175 million annually by the third year following theMerger, our results of operations could be impaired. In addition, the overall integration of the two companies may result in unanticipated operations problems, expenses and liabilities, and diversionof management's attention.         If Pentland and the Coors Trust do not agree on a matter submitted to stockholders, generally the matter will not be approved, even if beneficial to the Companyor favored by other stockholders. Pentland and the Coors Trust, which together control more than two-thirds of the Company's Class A Common and Exchangeablestock, have voting trust agreements through which they have combined their voting power over the shares of our Class A common stock and the Class A exchangeable shares that they own.However, in the event that these two stockholders do not agree to vote in favor of a matter submitted to a stockholder vote (other than the election of directors), the voting trustees will be requiredto vote all of the Class A common stock and Class A exchangeable shares deposited in the voting trusts against the matter. There is no other mechanism in the voting trust agreements toresolve 15 apotential deadlock between these stockholders. Therefore, if either Pentland or the Coors Trust is unwilling to vote in favor of a transaction that is subject to a stockholder vote, we may be unableto complete the transaction even if our board, management or other stockholders believe the transaction is beneficial for Molson Coors. Risks specific to our Discontinued Operations          Indemnities provided to the purchaser of 68% of the Kaiser business in Brazil could result in future cash outflows and income statementcharges. On January 13, 2006, we sold a 68% equity interest in Kaiser to FEMSA for $68 million cash, including the assumption by FEMSA of Kaiser-related debt andcontingencies. The terms of the agreement require us to indemnify FEMSA for exposures related to certain tax, civil and labor contingencies. The ultimate resolution of these claims is not under ourcontrol, and we cannot predict the outcomes of administrative and judicial proceedings that will occur with regard to these claims. It is possible that we will have to make cash outlays to FEMSA withregard to these indemnities. While the fair values of these indemnity obligations will be recorded on our balance sheet in conjunction with the sale, we could incur future income statement charges asfacts further develop resulting in changes to our fair value estimates. Risks specific to our Company          Our success as an enterprise depends largely on the success of three primary products; the failure or weakening of one or more couldmaterially adversely affect our financial results. Although we currently have 14 products in our US portfolio, Coors Light represented more than 72% of our US sales volume for2005. Carling lager is the best-selling brand in the United Kingdom and representedapproximately 75% of CBL sales volume in 2005. The combination of the Molson Canadian and Coors Light brands represented approximately 45% of our Canada segment's sales volume for the year endedDecember 25, 2005. Consequently, any material shift in consumer preferences away from these brands would have a disproportionately large adverse impact on our business.         We have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our stockholders' equity, which could hinder our ability to adjust to rapid changes in market conditionsor to respond to competitive pressures. As of December 25, 2005, we had $850 million in debt primarily related to our acquisition of CBL, and $1.4 billionof debt primarily related to our Merger with Molson. As a result, we must use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt. If our financial andoperating performance is insufficient to generate sufficient cash flow for all of our activities, our operations could be adversely impacted.         We rely on a small number of suppliers to obtain the packaging we need to operate our business, of which the loss or inability to obtain materials couldnegatively affect our ability to produce our products. For our US business, we purchase most of our paperboard and container supplies from a single supplier or a small numberof suppliers. This packaging is unique and is not produced by any other supplier. Additionally, we are contractually obligated to purchase substantially all our can and bottle needs in the UnitedStates from our container joint ventures or from our partners in those ventures, Ball Corporation (RMMC) and Owens-Brockway Glass Container, Inc. (RMBC). Consolidation of the glass bottleindustry in North America has reduced local supply alternatives and increased risks of glass bottle supply disruptions. CBL has only a single source for its can supply (Ball). The inability of any ofthese suppliers to meet our production requirements without sufficient time to develop an alternative source could have a material adverse effect on our business.         Our primary production facilities in Europe and the United States are located at single sites, so we could be more vulnerable than our competitors totransportation disruptions, fuel increases and natural disasters. Our primary production facility in the United States is in Golden, Colorado and in Europe, our primaryproduction facility is located in Burton-on-Trent, England. In both countries, our competitors 16 havemultiple geographically dispersed breweries and packaging facilities. As a result, we must ship our products greater distances than some of our competitors, making us more vulnerable tofluctuations in costs such as fuel, as well as the impact of any localized natural disasters should they occur.         The termination of one or more manufacturer/distribution agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business. We manufactureand/or distribute products of other beverage companies, including those of one or more competitors, through various licensing, distribution or other arrangements in Canada and the United Kingdom. Theloss of one or more of these arrangements could have a material adverse effect on the results of one or more reporting segments.         Because we will continue to face intense global competition, operating results may be negatively impacted. The brewing industry is highlycompetitive and requires substantial human and capital resources. Competition in our various markets could cause us to reduce prices, increase capital and other expenditures or lose sales volume, anyof which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, in some of our markets, our primary competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing,production and distribution resources than Molson Coors has. In all of the markets where Molson Coors operates, aggressive marketing strategies by our main competitors could adversely affect ourfinancial results.         Changes in tax, environmental or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing, trade and other regulations could have a material adverse effecton our financial condition. Our business is highly regulated by federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in various countries regarding such matters aslicensing requirements, trade and pricing practices, labeling, advertising, promotion and marketing practices, relationships with distributors, environmental matters and other matters. Failure tocomply with these laws and regulations could result in the loss, revocation or suspension of our licenses, permits or approvals. In addition, changes in tax, environmental or any other laws orregulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.         We are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, most significantly the British pound and the Canadian dollar. We hold assets andincur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in different currencies, most significantly sales of Coors Light in Canada, and sales of the Carling brand in the United Kingdom. Since our financialstatements are presented in US dollars, we must translate our assets, liabilities, income and expenses into US dollars at current exchange rates. Increases and decreases in the value of the US dollarwill affect, perhaps adversely, the value of these items in our financial statements, even if their local currency value has not changed.         Our operations face significant commodity price change and foreign exchange rate exposure which could materially and adversely affect our operatingresults. We will use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials to produce our products, including malt, hops, water and packaging materials. The supply and priceof these raw materials can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including frosts, droughts and other weather conditions, economic factors affecting growth decisions, plant diseases,theft and market demand. To the extent any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of ingredients or packaging; our results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted. We have activehedging programs to address commodity price and foreign exchange rate changes. However, to the extent we fail to adequately manage the foregoing risks, including if our hedging arrangements do noteffectively or completely hedge changes in foreign currency rates or commodity price risks, our results of operations may be adversely impacted.         We could be adversely affected by overall declines in the beer market. Industry trends in many global markets indicate increases inconsumer preference for wine and spirits, as well as for lower priced, value segment beer brands in some Canada markets, which could result in loss of volume or operating margins. 17         Because of our reliance on a limited number of technical service suppliers, we could experience significant disruption to our business. Werely exclusively on one information technology services provider for our network, help desk, hardware, and software configuration for our US and UK businesses. Additionally, we rely on a singleprovider in Canada. If the service providers fail and we are unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner, we could be unable to properly administer our information technology systems.         Due to a high concentration of unionized workers in the United Kingdom and Canada, we could be significantly affected by labor strikes, work stoppages orother employee-related issues. Approximately 29% of CBL's total workforce and approximately 67% of Molson's total workforce is represented by trade unions.Although we believe relations with our employees are good, more stringent labor laws in the United Kingdom expose us to a greater risk of loss should we experience labor disruptions in that market.         Changes to the regulation of the distribution systems for our products could adversely impact our business. The US Supreme Court recentlyruled that certain state regulations of interstate wine shipments are unlawful. As a result of this decision, states may alter the three-tier distribution system that has historicallyapplied to the distribution of our products. Although it is too early to tell what, if any, changes states may make as a result of this decision, changes to the three-tier distribution system couldhave a materially adverse impact on our business. Further, in certain Canadian provinces, our products are distributed through joint venture arrangements that are mandated and regulated by provincialgovernment regulators. If provincial regulation should change, effectively eliminating the distribution channels, the costs to adjust our distribution methods could have a material adverse impact onour business. Risks specific to the US Segment          Litigation directed at the alcohol beverage industry may adversely affect our sales volumes, our business and our financialresults. Molson Coors and many other brewers and distilled spirits manufacturers have been sued in several courts regarding advertising practices and underage consumption. Thesuits allege that each defendant intentionally marketed its products to ""children and other underage consumers."" In essence, each suit seeks, on behalf of an undefined class of parents and guardians,an injunction andunspecified money damages. We will vigorously defend these lawsuits and it is not possible at this time to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, in these lawsuits.         We are highly dependent on independent distributors in the United States to sell our products, with no assurance that these distributors will effectively sell ourproducts. We sell all of our products in the United States to distributors for resale to retail outlets. Some of our distributors are at a competitive disadvantage because theyare smaller than the largest distributors in their markets. Our distributors also sell products that compete with our products. These distributors may give our competitors' products higher priority,thereby reducing sales of our products. In addition, the regulatory environment of many states makes it very difficult to change distributors. Consequently, if we are not allowed or are unable toreplace unproductive or inefficient distributors, our business, financial position, and results of operation may be adversely affected. Risks specific to the Canada Segment          We may be required to provide funding to or exercise control over the entity that owns the entertainment business and theMontréal Canadiens pursuant to the guarantees given to its lenders and the NHL. Pursuant to certain guarantees given to the lenders and the NHL in support of theentity that owns the majority of the entertainment business and the Montréal Canadiens professional hockey club (purchased from Molson in 2001), Molson shall provide funding to theentity to meet its obligations to the lenders and the entity's operating expenses and Molson shall exercise control over the entity that owns the hockey 18 clubat predetermined conditions, subject to NHL approval, if the entity does not meet its obligations under various agreements.         An adverse result in a lawsuit brought by Miller could have an adverse impact on our business. In December 2005, Miller BrewingCompany sued the Company and several subsidiaries in a Wisconsin federal court. Miller seeks to invalidate a licensing agreement allowing Molson Canada the sole distribution of Miller products inCanada. Miller claims US and Canadian antitrust violations, and violations of the Agreement's confidentiality provisions. Miller also claims that the Agreement's purposes have been frustrated as aresult of the Molson Coors merger. If Miller were to prevail in this action, it could have an adverse impact on our business.         If we are unsuccessful in renegotiating licensing, distribution and related agreements, our business could suffer adverse effects. Wemanufacture and/or distribute products of other beverage companies in Canada, including those of one or more competitors, through various licensing, distribution or other arrangements. We arecurrently in negotiations with two of such companies to enter into new agreements. The loss of one or more of these arrangements could adversely impact our business.         If regulatory authorities determine that industry understandings regarding the bottle standards are invalid, our business could be adverselyimpacted. The Canadian Competition Bureau is currently reviewing the validity of industry arrangements regarding industry bottle standards. If the Bureau were to determine thatthe agreement is anticompetitive, we may be required to use multiple bottle types which could significantly increase our production and other related costs. Risks specific to the Europe Segment          Consolidation of pubs and growth in the size of pub chains in the United Kingdom could result in less ability to achievepricing. The trend toward consolidation of pubs, away from independent pub and club operations, is continuing in the United Kingdom. These larger entities have stronger pricenegotiating power, which could impact CBL's ability to obtain favorable pricing in the on-premise channel (due to spillover effect of reduced negotiating leverage) and couldreduce our revenues and profit margins. In addition, these larger customers are beginning to purchase directly more of the products that, in the past, we have provided as part of our factoredbusiness. This consolidation could impact us adversely.         We depend exclusively on one logistics provider in England, Wales and Scotland for distribution of our CBL products. We are involved in ajoint venture with Exel Logistics called Tradeteam. Tradeteam handles all of the physical distribution for CBL in England, Wales and Scotland, except where a different distribution system is requestedby a customer. If Tradeteam were unable to continue distribution of our product and we were unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner, we could experience significant disruptions in ourbusiness that could have an adverse impact on our operations.         We are reliant on a single third party as a supplier for kegs in the United Kingdom. We do not own our kegs in the United Kingdom; ratherwe source our kegs from a logistics provider who is responsible for their ownership, upkeep, and to maintain an adequate stock. If this third party provider were to have a business failure, we may berequired to purchase a stock of kegs, the estimated cost of which would be $61 million.         Sales volumes in the United Kingdom brewing industry have been moving from on-premise locations to off-premise locations, a trend whichunfavorably impacts our profitability. We have noted in recent years that beer volume sales in the UK have been shifting from pubs and restaurants(on-premise) to retail stores (off-premise), for the industry in general. Margins on sales to off-premise customers tend to be lower than margins on sales toon-premise customers. A continuation of this trend could adversely impact our profitability"
