7,DCI,DONALDSON CO INC,2023-09-22,"Risk Factors
The Company’s (we, our or us) business is subject to various risks and uncertainties. The following discussion outlines what we believe to be the risk factors that could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. These risk factors should be considered with the Company’s cautionary comments related to forward-looking statements when evaluating information provided in this Annual Report. Risks not currently known to the Company, or which the Company currently believes are immaterial, may also impair the Company’s business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. The Company periodically reviews its strategies, processes and controls with respect to risk identification, assessment and mitigation with the audit committee of the Company’s board of directors.Macroeconomic and Geopolitical RisksGlobal Operations - we have a broad footprint and global operations may present challenges.We have operations throughout the world. Our stability, growth and profitability are subject to a number of risks of doing business globally including the following:•political and military events, including the rise of nationalism and support for protectionist policies;•tariffs, trade barriers and other trade restrictions;•legal and regulatory requirements, including import, export, defense regulations, anti-corruption laws and foreign exchange controls;•potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations;•credit risk of local customers and distributors;•deterioration in economic conditions, including the effect of inflation on our customers and suppliers;•difficulties in protecting our intellectual property; and•local economic, political and social conditions.Due to the global reach of our operations, our business is subject to a complex system of commercial and trade laws, regulations and policies, including those related to data privacy, trade compliance, anti-corruption and anti-bribery. We experience exposure to and costs of complying with, these laws and regulations. Our global subsidiaries, joint venture partners and affiliates are governed by laws, rules and business practices that differ from those of the U.S. Our compliance programs may not adequately prevent or deter our employees, agents, distributors, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business from violating laws, regulations or standards. We may incur defense costs, fines, penalties, damage to our reputation and business disruptions, which could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Business Disruption - unexpected events, including natural disasters, may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations.There could be an occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including a terrorist attack, war or civil unrest, a weather event, a natural disaster, a climate-related event, a pandemic or other catastrophe in countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located. Such an event could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our headquarters, manufacturing facilities or distribution centers, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers, disruption in the transport of our products to customers and disruption of information systems. Existing insurance coverage may not provide protection for all costs that may arise from any such event. Any disruption in our operations could have an adverse impact on our ability to meet our customer needs or may require us to incur additional expense in order to produce sufficient inventory. Certain unexpected events could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.10Operational RisksSupply Chain - unavailable raw materials, significant demand fluctuations and material cost inflation have and could continue to have an impact on our sales and cost of sales.We obtain raw materials, including steel, filter media, petroleum-based products and other components from third-party suppliers. We often concentrate our sourcing of some materials from one supplier or a few suppliers. We rely, in part, on our suppliers to ensure they meet required quality and delivery standards. An unanticipated delay in delivery by our suppliers could result in the inability to deliver our products on time and to meet the expectations of our customers. We have experienced and could continue to experience, an increase in the costs of doing business, including increasing raw material prices and transportation costs, which have and could continue to have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Personnel - our success has been and could in the future be affected, if we are not able to attract, engage, train and retain qualified personnel.Our success depends in large part on our ability to identify, recruit, engage, train and retain highly skilled, qualified and diverse personnel globally and successfully execute management transitions at leadership levels of the Company. There is competition for talent with market-leading skills and capabilities in new technologies. Additionally, in some locations we have experienced labor shortages causing significant wage inflation and workplace availability. We may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel and it may be difficult for us to compete effectively, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Operations - complexity of manufacturing could cause inability to meet demand and result in the loss of customers.Our ability to fulfill customer orders is dependent on our manufacturing and distribution operations. Although we forecast demand, additional plant capacity takes significant time to bring online and thus, unexpected or extreme changes in demand could result in longer lead times. We cannot guarantee we will be able to adjust manufacturing capacity, in the short-term, to meet higher customer demand. Efficient operations require streamlining processes to maintain or reduce lead times, which we may not be capable of achieving. Unacceptable levels of service for key customers may result if we are not able to fulfill orders on a timely basis or if product quality, warranty or safety issues result from compromised production. We may not be able to adjust our production schedules to reflect changes in customer demand on a timely basis. Due to the complexity of our manufacturing operations, we may be unable to timely respond to fluctuations in demand, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Products - maintaining a competitive advantage requires consistent investment with uncertain returns.We operate in highly competitive markets and have numerous competitors that are already be well-established in those markets. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products that could be competitive in both price and performance. We believe we have certain technological advantages over our competitors, but maintaining these advantages requires us to consistently invest in research and development, sales and marketing and customer service and support. There is no guarantee we will be successful in maintaining these advantages and we could encounter the commoditization of our key products. We make investments in new technologies that address increased performance and regulatory requirements around the globe. There is no guarantee we will be successful in completing development or achieving sales of these products or that the margins on such products will be acceptable. A competitor’s successful product innovation could reach the market before ours or gain broader market acceptance, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Evolving Customer Needs - disruptive technologies may threaten our growth in certain industries.Certain industry market trends guide decisions we make in operating the Company and our growth could be threatened by disruptive technologies. We may be adversely impacted by changes in technology that could reduce or eliminate the demand for our products. These risks include wider adoption of technologies providing alternatives to diesel engines such as electrification of equipment or other alternative power solutions. Such disruptive innovation could create new markets and displace existing companies and products, resulting in significantly negative consequences for the Company. If we do not properly address future customer needs, we may be slower to adapt to such disruption, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.11Competition - we participate in highly competitive markets with pricing pressure.The businesses and product lines in which we participate are very competitive and we risk losing business based on a wide range of factors, including price, technology, performance, reliability and availability, geographic coverage and customer service. Our customers continue to seek technological innovation, productivity gains, competitive prices, reliability and availability from us and their other suppliers. Additionally, we sell through a variety of channels (e.g., OEM, dealer, distributor and eCommerce) in a diverse set of highly competitive filtration markets. The variability complicates the supply chain, affects working capital needs, requires balance between relationships and drives a more targeted sales force. As a result of these and other factors, we may not be able to compete effectively, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Customer Concentration and Retention - a number of our customers operate in similar cyclical industries. Changes in economic conditions in these industries could impact our sales.No customer accounted for 10% or more of our net sales in fiscal 2023, 2022 or 2021. However, a number of our customers are concentrated in similar cyclical industries (e.g., construction, agriculture, mining, oil and gas, transportation, power generation and disk drive), resulting in additional risk based on their respective economic conditions. Our success is also dependent on retaining key customers, which requires us to successfully manage relationships and anticipate the needs of our customers in the channels in which we sell our products. Changes in economic conditions could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Productivity Improvements - if we do not successfully manage productivity improvements, we may not realize the expected benefits.Our financial projections assume certain ongoing productivity improvements as a key component of our business strategy to, among other things, contain operating expenses, maintain competitiveness, increase operating efficiencies and align manufacturing capacity to demand. We may not be able to realize the expected benefits and cost savings if we do not successfully execute these plans while continuing to invest in business growth. Such cost savings may not otherwise be realized or other difficulties could be encountered, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) - achieving commitments could result in additional costs and our inability to achieve them could have an adverse impact on our reputation and performance.We periodically communicate our strategies, commitments and targets related to ESG matters, including greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and diversity, equity and inclusion through the issuance of our ESG report. Although we intend to meet these strategies, commitments and targets, we may be unable to achieve them due to impacts on resources, operational costs and technological advancements. In addition, standards and processes for measuring and reporting GHG emissions and other sustainability metrics may change over time, result in inconsistent data or result in significant revisions to our strategies, commitments and targets, or our ability to achieve them. Any scrutiny of our carbon emissions or other sustainability disclosures, our failure to achieve related strategies, commitments and targets or failure to meet sustainability requirements could negatively impact our reputation as well as the demand for our products and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.Acquisitions, Divestitures and Other Strategic Transactions - the execution of our acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions may not provide the desired return on investment.We have made and continue to pursue acquisitions and divestitures and may pursue joint ventures, strategic investments and other similar strategic transactions. Acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments could negatively impact our profitability and financial condition due to operating and integration inefficiencies, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and amortization of expenses related to intangible assets. There are also a number of other risks involved in acquisitions including the potential loss of key customers or employees, difficulties in assimilating the acquired operations and the diversion of management’s time and attention away from other business matters. Further, during the pendency of a proposed transaction, we may be subject to risks related to a decline in the business and the risk the transaction may not close. Divestitures may involve significant challenges and risks, such as difficulty separating out portions of our business or the potential loss of revenue or negative impacts on margins. The divestitures may also result in ongoing financial or legal proceedings, such as retained liabilities, which could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 12Cybersecurity RisksCybersecurity Risks - vulnerability of our information technology systems and security.We have many information technology systems that are important to the operation of our business, some of which are managed by third parties. These systems are used to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, which are critical to our operations. We could encounter difficulties in developing new systems, maintaining and upgrading our existing systems, managing access to these systems and preventing information security breaches. Additionally, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property and proprietary business information, in data centers and on information technology networks. Our data is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations that pertain to the collection and handling of personal information. The laws require us to notify governmental authorities and affected individuals of data breaches involving certain personal information. These laws include the European GDPR and the CCPA. Regulatory litigation or actions that could impose significant penalties may be brought against us in the event of a breach of data or alleged non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Information technology security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication; to date, none of the threats faced by the Company have been material. We have invested in protection to prevent these threats; however, there can be no assurance our efforts will prevent all potential failures, cybersecurity attacks or breaches of our systems. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Should such an attack succeed, it could lead to the compromise of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operation disruptions. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our reputation and could result in litigation, regulatory action, potential liability, increased costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection matters. The Company maintains insurance coverage for various cybersecurity and business continuity risks, however, there can be no guarantee all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured. Vulnerabilities could lead to significant additional expenses and an adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Legal and Regulatory RisksIntellectual Property - demand for our products may be affected by new entrants that copy our products and/or infringe on our intellectual property.The ability to protect and enforce intellectual property rights varies across jurisdictions. Where possible, we seek to preserve our intellectual property rights through patents. These patents have a limited life and, in some cases, have expired or will expire in the near future. Competitors and others may also initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our intellectual property rights or allege that we infringe their intellectual property rights. We may be required to pay substantial damages if it is determined our products infringe on their intellectual property rights. We may also be required to develop an alternative, non-infringing product that could be costly and time-consuming, or acquire a license on terms that are unfavorable to us.Protecting or defending against such claims could significantly increase our costs and divert management’s time and attention away from other business matters, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Legal and Regulatory - costs associated with lawsuits, investigations or complying with laws and regulations.We are subject to many laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We routinely incur costs in order to comply with these laws and regulations. We may be adversely impacted by new or changing laws and regulations that affect both our operations and our ability to develop and sell products that meet our customers’ requirements. We are involved in various product liability, product warranty, intellectual property, environmental claims and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business. We are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate, including those governing the environment (e.g., emissions to air; discharges to water; and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials; and the use of raw materials and goods such as iron, steel aluminum, electricity, natural gas and hydrogen) and data protection and privacy. It is not possible to predict the outcome of investigations and lawsuits and we could incur judgments, fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in any particular period. In addition, we may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against any losses.13Financial RisksCurrency - an unfavorable fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our results of operations.We have operations in many countries, with a substantial portion of our annual revenue earned in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We face transactional and translational risks associated with the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Transactional risk arises from changes in the value of cash flows denominated in different currencies. This can be caused by supply chains that cross borders resulting in revenues and costs being in different currencies. Translational risk arises from the remeasurement of our financial statements. In addition, decreased value of local currency may make it difficult for some of our customers, distributors and end users to purchase our products. Each of our subsidiaries reports its results of operations and financial position in its relevant functional currency, which is then translated into U.S. dollars. This translated financial information is included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Significant fluctuations of the U.S. dollar in comparison to the foreign currencies of our subsidiaries during discrete periods may have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Liquidity - changes in the capital and credit markets may negatively affect our ability to access financing to support strategic initiatives.Disruption of the global financial and credit markets may have an effect on our long-term liquidity and financial condition. There can be no assurance the cost or availability of future borrowings will not be impacted by future capital market disruptions. Some of our existing borrowings contain covenants to maintain certain financial ratios that, under certain circumstances, could restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments and other restricted payments, create liens and sell assets"

Any disruption in our operations could have an adverse impact on our ability to meet our customer needs or may require us to incur additional expense in order to produce sufficient inventory. Certain unexpected events could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.COVID-19 Pandemic Business Disruption - the COVID-19 pandemic had, and in the future could have, a negative effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the global economy and, consequently, the Company’s business and operations have been, and could continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We experienced temporary shutdowns in certain facilities and we, our employees, suppliers or customers may be prevented in the future from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time due to shutdowns, import or export restrictions or other preventative measures that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities.Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased economic uncertainty, has led to volatility in customer demand for the Company’s products and services and has caused supply chain disruptions. These events have and could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Russia and Ukraine Conflict - the ongoing military action by Russia in Ukraine could have a negative impact on the global economy which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.On February 24, 2022, Russian forces launched significant military action against Ukraine. As a result, the U.S. and other countries imposed sanctions, penalties and export controls against certain Russian entities and individuals. Although the duration and impact of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine are highly unpredictable, the conflict could lead to substantial market disruptions, including counter-sanctions, volatility in the credit available to us and our customers, heightened inflation and energy costs, supply chain disruptions, or delays in delivering products to our customers. Any such disruptions could have a negative impact on the global economy, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Operational RisksSupply Chain - unavailable raw materials, significant demand fluctuations and material cost inflation have and could continue to have an impact on our sales and cost of sales.We obtain raw materials, including steel, filter media, petroleum-based products and other components from third-party suppliers.

There is competition for talent with market-leading skills and capabilities in new technologies. Additionally, in some locations we have experienced significant wage inflation due to a shortage of labor, as well as labor shortages, amid low levels of unemployment or workforce availability in these markets.

Our stability, growth and profitability are subject to a number of risks of doing business globally including the following:•political and military events, including the rise of nationalism and support for protectionist policies;•tariffs, trade barriers and other trade restrictions;•legal and regulatory requirements, including import, export, defense regulations, anti-corruption laws and foreign exchange controls;•potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations;•credit risk of local customers and distributors;•difficulties in protecting our intellectual property; and•local economic, political and social conditions.Due to the global reach of our operations, our business is subject to a complex system of commercial and trade laws, regulations and policies, including those related to data privacy, trade compliance, anti-corruption and anti-bribery. We experience exposure to, and costs of complying with, these laws and regulations. Our global subsidiaries, joint venture partners and affiliates are governed by laws, rules and business practices that differ from those of the U.S. Our compliance programs may not adequately prevent or deter our employees, agents, distributors, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business from violating anti-corruption laws. We may incur defense costs, fines, penalties, damage to our reputation and business disruptions and it could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Business Disruption - unexpected events, including natural disasters, may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations.There could be an occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including a terrorist attack, war or civil unrest, a weather event, an earthquake, a pandemic or other catastrophe in countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located. Such an event could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our headquarters, manufacturing facilities or distribution centers, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers, disruption in the transport of our products to customers and disruption of information systems. Existing insurance coverage may not provide protection for all costs that may arise from any such event. Any disruption in our operations could have an adverse impact on our ability to meet our customer needs or may require us to incur additional expense in order to produce sufficient inventory. Certain unexpected events could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.COVID-19 Pandemic Business Disruption - pandemics and certain events like the COVID-19 pandemic have and could in the future have, a negative effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition and cash flows.The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the global economy and, consequently, the Company’s business and operations have been, and could continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we initially experienced temporary reductions and higher volatility in demand for our products. Subsequently, we experienced increased demand for our products, particularly in our Engine Products segment, which we were not able to fully meet, and may not be able to meet in the near future, within our normal delivery timeframe due to supply chain constraints. 4Although most of our operations were treated as “essential” operations under applicable government orders which restrict business activities, and accordingly were permitted to continue to operate, it is possible that in a future event, treatment as an “essential” business could change under future government orders or new restrictions may be added. We previously experienced temporary shutdowns in certain facilities and we, our employees, suppliers or customers may be prevented in the future from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including shutdowns, shelter-in-place orders, import or export restrictions or other preventative measures that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. Further, site-specific health and safety concerns could require certain of our operations to be halted for some period of time. Operations at all our facilities have been modified with enhanced safety protocols, including social distancing measures and enhanced cleaning regimens with greater frequency, which may continue to affect the efficiency of our operations for the foreseeable future. The Company’s supply chain and manufacturing operations have, and may continue to experience logistical and production-limiting constraints.In addition, the facilities of our customers and suppliers have experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions in manufacturing and supply arrangements due to the loss or disruption of essential manufacturing and supply elements, such as raw materials or other finished product components, transportation, workforce or other manufacturing and distribution capability. We may also experience failure of third parties on which we rely, including our suppliers, distributors, contractors and commercial banks, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so. These events have and could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Operational RisksSupply Chain - unavailable raw materials, significant demand fluctuations and material cost inflation have and could continue to have an impact on our sales and cost of sales.We obtain raw materials, including steel, filter media, petroleum-based products and other components, from third-party suppliers and carry limited raw material inventories. We often concentrate our sourcing of some materials from one supplier or a few suppliers. We rely, in part, on our suppliers to ensure they meet required quality and delivery standards. Our success is dependent on our ability to effectively manage our supplier relationships. Additionally, global supplier production capacity is limited and could be disrupted. We may experience significant disruption of the supply of raw materials, parts, components or final assemblies. An unanticipated delay in delivery by our suppliers could result in the inability to deliver our products on-time and to meet the expectations of our customers. We have experienced, and could continue to experience, an increase in the costs of doing business, including increasing raw material prices and transportation costs, which have and could continue to have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Personnel - our success has been, and could in the future be affected, if we are not able to attract, engage and retain qualified personnel.Our success depends in large part on our ability to identify, recruit, engage, train and retain highly skilled, qualified and diverse personnel globally and successfully execute management transitions at leadership levels of the Company. There is competition for talent with market-leading skills and capabilities in new technologies. Additionally, in some locations we have experienced significant wage inflation due to a shortage of labor, as well as labor shortages, amid low levels of unemployment or workforce availability in these markets. We may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel and it may be difficult for us to compete effectively, which could adversely impact our business.Operations - complexity of manufacturing could cause inability to meet demand and result in the loss of customers.Our ability to fulfill customer orders is dependent on our manufacturing and distribution operations. Although we forecast demand, additional plant capacity takes significant time to bring online, and thus changes in demand could result in longer lead times. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to adjust manufacturing capacity, in the short-term, to meet higher customer demand. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic caused labor shortages, manufacturing disruptions and temporary shutdowns of business at some of our customers and suppliers, and lower levels of production at our manufacturing plants. These disruptions impacted the availability of raw materials and freight availability, which have increased lead times. Efficient operations require streamlining processes to maintain or reduce lead times, which we may not be capable of achieving. Unacceptable levels of service for key customers may result if we are not able to fulfill orders on a timely basis or if product quality or warranty or safety issues result from compromised production. We may not be able to adjust our production schedules to reflect changes in customer demand on a timely basis. Due to the complexity of our manufacturing operations, we may be unable to timely respond to fluctuations in demand, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.5Products - maintaining a competitive advantage requires consistent investment with uncertain returns.We operate in highly competitive markets and have numerous competitors that may already be well-established in those markets. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products that could be competitive in both price and performance. We believe that we have certain technological advantages over our competitors, but maintaining these advantages requires us to consistently invest in research and development, sales and marketing and customer service and support. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in maintaining these advantages and we could encounter the commoditization of our key products. We make investments in new technologies that address increased performance and regulatory requirements around the globe. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in completing development or achieving sales of these products or that the margins on such products will be acceptable. A competitor’s successful product innovation could reach the market before ours or gain broader market acceptance, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Evolving Customer Needs - disruptive technologies may threaten our growth in certain industries. Certain industry market trends guide decisions we make in operating the Company, and our growth could be threatened by disruptive technologies. We may be adversely impacted by changes in technology that could reduce or eliminate the demand for our products. These risks include wider adoption of technologies providing alternatives to diesel engines such as electrification of equipment. Such disruptive innovation could create new markets and displace existing companies and products, resulting in significantly negative consequences for the Company. If we do not properly address future customer needs, we may be slower to adapt to such disruption, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Competition - we participate in highly competitive markets with pricing pressure.The businesses and product lines in which we participate are very competitive and we risk losing business based on a wide range of factors, including price, technology, performance, reliability and availability, geographic coverage and customer service. Our customers continue to seek technological innovation, productivity gains, competitive prices, reliability and availability from us and their other suppliers. As a result of these and other factors, we may not be able to compete effectively, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Customer Concentration and Retention - a number of our customers operate in similar cyclical industries. Economic conditions in these industries could impact our sales.No customer accounted for 10% or more of our net sales in fiscal 2021, 2020 or 2019. However, a number of our customers are concentrated in similar cyclical industries (e.g. construction, agriculture, mining, oil and gas, transportation, power generation and disk drive), resulting in additional risk based on their respective economic conditions. Our success is also dependent on retaining key customers, which requires us to successfully manage relationships and anticipate the needs of our customers in the channels in which we sell our products. Changes in the economic conditions could materially and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Impairment - if our operating units do not meet performance expectations, intangible assets could be subject to impairment.Our total assets include goodwill and other intangible assets from acquisitions. We review annually whether goodwill and other intangible assets have been impaired, or more frequently if there have been unexpected events or changes in circumstances. If future operating performance at one or more of our operating units were to fall significantly below forecast levels or if market conditions for one or more of our acquired businesses were to decline, we could be required to incur a non-cash charge to operating income for impairment. Additionally, we could potentially have excess capacity and underutilized assets. Impairment charges on our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.Productivity Improvements - if we do not successfully manage productivity improvements, we may not realize the expected benefits.Our financial projections assume certain ongoing productivity improvements as a key component of our business strategy to, among other things, contain operating expenses, increase operating efficiencies and align manufacturing capacity to demand. We may not be able to realize the expected benefits and cost savings if we do not successfully execute these plans while continuing to invest in business growth. Difficulties could be encountered or such cost savings may not otherwise be realized, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.6Internal Controls - if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results and prevent material fraud, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. Effective internal control over financial reporting, including controls within the information technology environment, is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent and detect material fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent or detect material fraud, our operating results could be misstated. There can be no assurances that we will be able to prevent future control deficiencies from occurring, which could cause us to incur unforeseen costs, negatively impact our results of operations, cause the market price of our common stock to decline or have other potential adverse consequences.Cybersecurity RisksTechnology Investments and Security Risks - vulnerability of our information technology systems and security.We have many information technology systems that are important to the operation of our business, some of which are managed by third parties. These systems are used to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. We could encounter difficulties in developing new systems, maintaining and upgrading our existing systems, managing access to these systems and preventing information security breaches. Vulnerabilities could lead to significant additional expenses and an adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Additionally, information technology security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication. We have invested in protection to prevent these threats; to date none of them have been material. However, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent all potential failures, cybersecurity attacks or breaches in our systems. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Should such an attack succeed, it could lead to the compromise of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operation disruptions. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our reputation and could result in litigation, regulatory action, potential liability, increased costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection matters.Our data is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations that pertain to the collection and handling of personal information. The laws require us to notify governmental authorities and affected individuals of data breaches involving certain personal information. These laws include the European General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act. Regulatory litigation or actions that could impose significant penalties may be brought against us in the event of a breach of data or alleged non-compliance with such laws and regulations. The Company maintains insurance coverage for various cybersecurity and business continuity risks, however, there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured.Legal and Regulatory RisksIntellectual Property - demand for our products may be affected by new entrants that copy our products and/or infringe on our intellectual property.The ability to protect and enforce intellectual property rights varies across jurisdictions. Where possible, we seek to preserve our intellectual property rights through patents. These patents have a limited life and, in some cases, have expired or will expire in the near future. Competitors and others may also initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our intellectual property or allege that we infringe their intellectual property. We may be required to pay substantial damages if it is determined our products infringe on their intellectual property. We may also be required to develop an alternative, non-infringing product that could be costly and time-consuming, or acquire a license on terms that are unfavorable to us.Protecting or defending against such claims could significantly increase our costs and divert management’s time and attention away from other business matters, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.7Legal and Regulatory - costs associated with lawsuits, investigations or complying with laws and regulations.We are subject to many laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We routinely incur costs in order to comply with these laws and regulations. We may be adversely impacted by new or changing laws and regulations that affect both our operations and our ability to develop and sell products that meet our customers’ requirements. We are involved in various product liability, product warranty, intellectual property, environmental claims and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business. We are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate, including those governing the environment (e.g. emissions to air; discharges to water; and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials) and data protection and privacy. It is not possible to predict the outcome of investigations and lawsuits, and we could incur judgments, fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in any particular period. In addition, we may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against any losses.Financial RisksCurrency - an unfavorable fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our results of operation.We have operations in many countries, with a substantial portion of our annual revenue earned in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We face transactional and translational risks associated with the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Transactional risk arises from changes in the value of cash flows denominated in different currencies. This can be caused by supply chains that cross borders resulting in revenues and costs being in different currencies. Translational risk arises from the remeasurement of our financial statements. In addition, decreased value of local currency may make it difficult for some of our customers, distributors and end users to purchase our products. Each of our subsidiaries reports its results of operations and financial position in its relevant functional currency, which is then translated into U.S. dollars. This translated financial information is included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Significant fluctuations of the U.S. dollar in comparison to the foreign currencies of our subsidiaries during discrete periods may have a negative impact on our results of operation, financial condition and cash flows. Liquidity - changes in the capital and credit markets may negatively affect our ability to access financing to support strategic initiatives.Disruption of the global financial and credit markets may have an effect on our long-term liquidity and financial condition. There can be no assurance that the cost or availability of future borrowings will not be impacted by future capital market disruptions. Some of our existing borrowings contain covenants to maintain certain financial ratios that, under certain circumstances, could restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments and other restricted payments, create liens and sell assets. General RisksIncome Tax - changes in our effective tax rate in various jurisdictions.We are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and regulations. We are also subject to the prevailing tax laws and the examination of our income tax returns by tax authorities. Acquisitions, Divestitures and Other Strategic Transactions - the execution of our acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions may not provide the desired return on investment.We have made and continue to pursue acquisitions and divestitures and may pursue joint ventures, strategic investments and other similar strategic transactions. Acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments could negatively impact our profitability and financial condition due to operating and integration inefficiencies, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and amortization of expenses related to intangible assets. There are also a number of other risks involved in acquisitions, including the potential loss of key customers, difficulties in assimilating the acquired operations, the loss of key employees and the diversion of management’s time and attention away from other business matters, that may prevent us from realizing the anticipated return on our investment. Divestitures may involve significant challenges and risks, such as difficulty separating out portions of our business or the potential loss of revenue or negative impacts on margins. The divestitures may also result in ongoing financial or legal proceedings, such as retained liabilities, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operation, financial condition and cash flows. Further, during the pendency of a proposed transaction, we may be subject to risks related to a decline in the business, loss of employees, customers or suppliers and the risk that the transaction may not close, any of which could adversely impact our business.8"
3,DCI,DONALDSON CO INC,2020-09-25,"Risk Factors
Our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties, and the following discussion outlines what we believe to be the risk factors that could materially, adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. These risk factors should be considered with the Company’s cautionary comments related to forward-looking statements when evaluating information provided in this Annual Report. Risks not currently known to the Company, or that the Company currently believes are immaterial, may also impair the Company’s business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. The Company periodically reviews its strategies, processes, and controls with respect to risk identification, assessment and mitigation with the audit committee of the Company’s board of directors.Coronavirus Business Disruption - pandemics and unexpected events like COVID-19 has and could continue to have a negative effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition and cash flows.The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the global economy and, consequently, the Company’s business and operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the pandemic. We have experienced significant demand reductions and volatility for our products. The duration of the pandemic and the magnitude of its impact remain uncertain, and a prolonged or worsening disruption or a resulting economic recession could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Although most of our operations have been treated as “essential” operations under applicable government orders which restrict business activities, and accordingly have been permitted to continue to operate, it is possible that treatment as an “essential” business could change under future government orders or new restrictions may be added in response to the evolving conditions. We have experienced temporary shutdowns in certain facilities and we, our employees, suppliers or customers may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including shutdowns, shelter-in-place orders, import or export restrictions or other preventative measures that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. Further, site-specific health and safety concerns might otherwise require certain of our operations to be halted for some period of time. Operations at all our facilities have been modified for employee protection measures, including social distancing measures and enhanced cleaning regimens with greater frequency, which may continue to affect the efficiency of our operations for the foreseeable future. In addition, the facilities of our customers and suppliers may experience disruptions in manufacturing and supply arrangements due to the loss or disruption of essential manufacturing and supply elements, such as raw materials or other finished product components, transportation, workforce or other manufacturing and distribution capability. We may also experience failure of third parties on which we rely, including our suppliers, distributors, contractors and commercial banks, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so. Economic Environment - the demand for our products is impacted by economic, industrial and political conditions worldwide.We operate a global business in a diverse set of markets and our results and financial condition may be impacted by changes in economic, industrial and political conditions in the geographies and markets we serve.Products - maintaining a competitive advantage requires consistent investment with uncertain returns.We operate in highly competitive markets and have numerous competitors that may already be well-established in those markets. We expect our competitors to continue improving the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products that could be competitive in both price and performance. We believe that we have certain technological advantages over our competitors, but maintaining these advantages requires us to consistently invest in research and development, sales and marketing and customer service and support. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in maintaining these advantages and we could encounter the commoditization of our key products. We make investments in new technologies that address increased performance and regulatory requirements around the globe. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in completing development or achieving sales of these products or that the margins on such products will be acceptable. A competitor’s successful product innovation could reach the market before ours or gain broader market acceptance. 3Evolving Customer Needs - disruptive technologies may threaten our growth in certain industries. Market trends in certain industries guides the decisions we make in operating the Company, and our growth could be threatened by disruptive technologies. We may be adversely impacted by changes in technology that could reduce or eliminate the demand for our products. These risks include wider adoption of technologies providing alternatives to diesel engines such as electrification of equipment. Such disruptive innovation could create new markets and displace existing companies and products, resulting in significantly negative consequences for the Company. If we do not properly address future customer needs, we may be slower to adapt to such disruption.Competition - we participate in highly competitive markets with pricing pressure.The businesses and product lines in which we participate are very competitive and we risk losing business based on a wide range of factors, including price, technology, performance, reliability and availability, geographic coverage and customer service. Our customers continue to seek technological innovation, productivity gains and competitive prices from us and their other suppliers. As a result of these and other factors, we may not be able to compete effectively.Intellectual Property - demand for our products may be affected by new entrants that copy our products and/or infringe on our intellectual property.The ability to protect and enforce intellectual property rights varies across jurisdictions. Where possible, we seek to preserve our intellectual property rights through patents. These patents have a limited life and, in some cases, have expired or will expire in the near future.

We may be required to pay substantial damages if it is determined our products infringe on their intellectual property. We may also be required to develop an alternative, non-infringing product that could be costly and time-consuming, or acquire a license on terms that are not favorable to us.Protecting or defending against such claims could significantly increase our costs and divert management’s time and attention away from other business matters.Global Operations - we have a broad footprint and global operations may present challenges.We have operations throughout the world. Our stability, growth and profitability are subject to a number of risks of doing business globally that could harm our business, including:•political and military events, including the rise of nationalism and support for protectionist policies,•tariffs, trade barriers and other trade restrictions,•legal and regulatory requirements, including import, export, defense regulations, anti-corruption laws and foreign exchange controls,•potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations,•credit risk of local customers and distributors,•difficulties in protecting our intellectual property, and•local economic, political and social conditions.Due to the global reach of our operations, our business is subject to a complex system of commercial and trade laws, regulations and policies, including those related to data privacy, trade compliance, anti-corruption and anti-bribery. Our global subsidiaries, joint venture partners and affiliates are governed by laws, rules and business practices that differ from those of the U.S. Violations of such laws and regulations may result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.The continued geographic expansion of our business increases our exposure to, and cost of complying with, these laws and regulations. If our compliance programs do not adequately prevent or deter our employees, agents, distributors, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business from violating anti-corruption laws, we may incur defense costs, fines, penalties, damage to our reputation and business disruptions.4Customer Concentration and Retention - a number of our customers operate in similar cyclical industries. Economic conditions in these industries could impact our sales.No customer accounted for 10% or more of our net sales in fiscal 2020, 2019 or 2018. However, a number of our customers are concentrated in similar cyclical industries (e.g. construction, agriculture, mining, oil and gas, transportation, power generation and disk drives), resulting in additional risk based on industrial conditions in those sectors. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced a decrease in demand for our products, which has adversely affected our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. A further decline in the economic conditions or capital expenditures of our customers could materially and adversely impact our results of operations. Our success is also dependent on retaining key customers, which requires us to successfully manage relationships and anticipate the needs of our customers in the channels in which we sell our products.Supply Chain - unavailable raw materials, significant demand fluctuations and material cost inflation could impact our sales.We obtain raw materials, including steel, filter media, petroleum-based products and other components, from third-party suppliers and tend to carry limited raw material inventories. We often concentrate our sourcing of some materials from one supplier or a few suppliers. We rely, in part, on our suppliers to ensure they meet required standards. Our success is dependent on our ability to effectively manage our supplier relationships. Additionally, global supplier production capacity is limited and could be disrupted. We may experience significant disruption of the supply of raw materials, parts, components or final assemblies. An unanticipated delay in delivery by our suppliers could result in the inability to deliver our products on-time and meet the expectations of our customers. We could experience an increase in the costs of doing business, including increasing raw material commodity prices and transportation costs.Operations - inability to meet demand could result in the loss of customers.Our ability to fulfill customer orders is dependent on our manufacturing and distribution operations. Although we forecast demand, additional plant capacity takes months or even years to bring online, and thus changes in demand could result in longer lead times. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase manufacturing capacity to meet higher product demand, which could prevent us from meeting increased customer demand. However, if demand varies significantly from our projections and we overbuild our capacity, we may have underutilized assets. For example, the current COVID-19 pandemic has caused manufacturing and distribution disruptions and temporary shutdowns of business at some of our customers and suppliers. This, combined with decreased customer demand, has resulted in decreased manufacturing levels. Efficient operations also require streamlining processes to maintain or reduce lead times, which we may not be capable of achieving. Unacceptable levels of service for key customers may result if we are not able to fulfill orders on a timely basis or if product quality or warranty or safety issues result from compromised production. We may not be able to adjust our production schedules to reflect changes in customer demand on a timely basis. Due to the complexity of our manufacturing operations, we may be unable to timely respond to fluctuations in demand.Technology Investments and Security Risks - vulnerability of our information technology systems and security.We have many information technology systems that are important to the operation of our business, some of which are managed by third parties. These systems are used to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. We could encounter difficulties in developing new systems, maintaining and upgrading our existing systems, managing access to these systems and preventing information security breaches. Vulnerabilities could lead to significant additional expenses and an adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Additionally, information technology security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication. We have found and addressed these threats; to date none of them have been material. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Should such an attack succeed, it could lead to the compromise of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operation disruptions.

In addition, decreased value of local currency may make it difficult for some of our customers, distributors and end users to purchase our products. Each of our subsidiaries reports its results of operations and financial position in its relevant functional currency, which is then translated into U.S. dollars. This translated financial information is included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Significant fluctuations of the U.S. dollar in comparison to the foreign currencies of our subsidiaries during discrete periods may have a negative impact on our results of operation, financial condition and cash flows. Legal and Regulatory - costs associated with lawsuits, investigations or complying with laws and regulations.We are subject to many laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We routinely incur costs in order to comply with these laws and regulations. We may be adversely impacted by new or changing laws and regulations that affect both our operations and our ability to develop and sell products that meet our customers’ requirements.

We are also subject to the prevailing tax laws and the continuous examination of our income tax returns by tax authorities. Personnel - our success may be affected if we are not able to attract, engage and retain qualified personnel.Our success depends in large part on our ability to identify, recruit, engage, train and retain highly skilled qualified and diverse personnel worldwide and successfully execute management transitions at leadership levels of the Company. There is competition for talent with market-leading skills and capabilities in new technologies. Additionally, in some locations we have experienced significant wage inflation due to a shortage of labor amid low levels of unemployment in these markets. We may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel and it may be difficult for us to compete effectively.Liquidity - changes in the capital and credit markets may negatively affect our ability to access financing to support strategic initiatives.Disruption of the global financial and credit markets may have an effect on our long-term liquidity and financial condition. There can be no assurance that the cost or availability of future borrowings will not be impacted by future capital market disruptions. Some of our existing borrowings contain covenants to maintain certain financial ratios that, under certain circumstances, could restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments and other restricted payments, create liens and sell assets. In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom (U.K.), the governing body responsible for regulating the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), announced that it no longer will compel or persuade financial institutions and panel banks to make LIBOR submissions after 2021. This decision is expected to result in the end of the use of LIBOR as a reference rate for commercial loans and other indebtedness. We have both LIBOR-denominated and Euro Interbank Offer Rate (EURIBOR)-denominated indebtedness or derivative instruments. The transition to alternatives to LIBOR could be modestly disruptive to the credit markets, and while we do not believe that the impact would be material to us, we do not yet have insight into what the impacts might be. 6Acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions - the execution of our acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions may not provide the desired return on investment.We have made and continue to pursue acquisitions and divestitures and may pursue joint ventures, strategic investments and other similar strategic transactions. Acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments could negatively impact our profitability and financial condition due to operating and integration inefficiencies, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and amortization of expenses related to intangible assets. There are also a number of other risks involved in acquisitions, including the potential loss of key customers, difficulties in assimilating the acquired operations, the loss of key employees and the diversion of management’s time and attention away from other business matters, that may prevent us from realizing the anticipated return on our investment. Divestitures may involve significant challenges and risks, such as difficulty separating out portions of our business or the potential loss of revenue or negative impacts on margins. The divestitures may also result in ongoing financial or legal proceedings, such as retained liabilities, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operation, financial condition and cash flows. Further, during the pendency of a proposed transaction, we may be subject to risks related to a decline in the business, loss of employees, customer or suppliers, and the risk that the transaction may not close, any of which could adversely affect the business subject to the proposed transaction and cause us to incur costs that may not be offset by a corresponding benefit.Impairment - if our operating units do not meet performance expectations, intangible assets could be subject to impairment.Our total assets include goodwill and other intangible assets from acquisitions. We review annually whether goodwill and other intangible assets have been impaired, or more frequently if there have been unexpected events or changes in circumstances. If future operating performance at one or more of our operating units were to fall significantly below forecast levels or if market conditions for one or more of our acquired businesses were to decline, we could be required to incur a non-cash charge to operating income for impairment. Any impairment charge would have an adverse non-cash impact on our results of operations and shareholders’ equity.Productivity Improvements - if we do not successfully manage productivity improvements, we may not realize the expected benefits.Our financial projections assume certain ongoing productivity improvements as a key component of our business strategy to, among other things, contain operating expenses, increase operating efficiencies and align manufacturing capacity to demand. We may not be able to realize the expected benefits and cost savings if we do not successfully execute these plans while continuing to invest in business growth. Difficulties could be encountered or such cost savings may not otherwise be realized.Business Disruption - unexpected events, including natural disasters, may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations.The occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including a terrorist attack, war or civil unrest, a weather event, an earthquake, pandemic or other catastrophe in the U.S. or in other countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Such event could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our headquarters, manufacturing facilities or distribution centers, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers, disruption in the transport of our products to customers and disruption of information systems. This could result in a prolonged disruption to our operations. Existing insurance coverage may not provide protection for all costs that may arise from such events. Any disruption in our manufacturing capacity could have an adverse impact on our ability to meet our customer needs or may require us to incur additional expenses in order to produce sufficient inventory.Internal Controls - if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results and prevent material fraud, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. Effective internal control over financial reporting, including controls within the information technology environment, is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent and detect material fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent or detect material fraud, our operating results could be misstated. There can be no assurances that we will be able to prevent future control deficiencies from occurring, which could cause us to incur unforeseen costs, negatively impact our results of operations, cause the market price of our common stock to decline or have other potential adverse consequences.7BREXIT - the United Kingdom’s decision to end its membership in the European Union could materially and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In June 2016, a majority of voters in the U.K. elected to withdraw from the European Union (E.U.) in a national referendum (BREXIT). The U.K. formally left the E.U. on January 31, 2020, and is in a transition period that ends on December 31, 2020. During the transition period, the U.K. essentially remains in the E.U.’s customs union and single market. Negotiations continue to determine the terms of BREXIT. The result of BREXIT have caused, and may continue to cause, volatility in global stock markets, currency exchange rate fluctuations and global economic uncertainty. Although it is unknown what the terms of the U.K.’s future relationship with the E.U. will be, it is possible that there will be higher tariffs or greater restrictions on imports and exports between the U.K. and the E.U. and increased regulatory complexities. The effects of BREXIT will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to E.U. markets on a temporary or permanent basis. These measures could potentially disrupt our supply chain, access to human capital and some of our target markets and jurisdictions in which we operate, and adversely change tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions. In addition, BREXIT could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations, including with respect to emissions and similar certifications granted to us by the E.U., as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate. "
12,DCI,DONALDSON CO INC,2019-09-27,"Risk Factors
Our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Any of the risks described below could materially, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The following discussion, along with discussions elsewhere in this report, outlines the risks and uncertainties that we believe are the most material to our business at this time. We undertake no obligation to revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise unless required by law. The Company’s audit committee reviews the Company’s strategies, processes, and controls with respect to risk assessment and risk management, including risks related to technology systems and cybersecurity, and assists the Board in its oversight of risk management.Economic Environment - the demand for our products is impacted by economic, industrial and political conditions worldwide.We operate a global business and our results and financial condition may be impacted by changes in industrial, economic or political conditions in the geographies and markets we serve.2Products - maintaining a competitive advantage requires consistent investment with uncertain returns.We operate in highly competitive markets and have numerous competitors that may already be well-established in those markets. We expect our competitors to continue improving the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products that could be competitive in both price and performance. We believe that we have certain technological advantages over our competitors, but maintaining these advantages requires us to consistently invest in research and development, sales and marketing and customer service and support. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in maintaining these advantages and we could encounter the commoditization of our key products. We make investments in new technologies that address increased performance and regulatory requirements around the globe. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in completing development or achieving sales of these products or that the margins on such products will be acceptable. A competitor’s successful product innovation could reach the market before ours or gain broader market acceptance. Evolving Customer Needs - disruptive technologies may threaten our growth in certain industries. Our growth in certain industries guides the decisions we make in operating the Company, but this growth could be threatened by disruptive technologies. We may be adversely impacted by changes in technology that could reduce or eliminate the demand for our products. These risks include wider adoption of technologies providing alternatives to diesel engines such as electrification of equipment. Such disruptive innovation could create new markets and displace existing companies and products, resulting in significantly negative consequences for the Company. If we do not properly address future customer needs, we may be slower to adapt to such disruption.Competition - we participate in highly competitive markets with pricing pressure.The businesses and product lines in which we participate are very competitive and we risk losing business based on a wide range of factors, including price, technology, performance, reliability and availability, geographic coverage and customer service. Our customers continue to seek technological innovation, productivity gains and competitive prices from us and their other suppliers. We may not be able to compete effectively.Intellectual Property - demand for our products may be affected by new entrants that copy our products and/or infringe on our intellectual property.The ability to protect and enforce intellectual property rights varies across jurisdictions. Where possible, we seek to preserve our intellectual property rights through patents. These patents have a limited life and, in some cases, have expired or will expire in the near future. Competitors and others may also initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our intellectual property or allege that we infringe their intellectual property. We may be required to pay substantial damages if it is determined our products infringe on their intellectual property. We may also be required to develop an alternative, non-infringing product that could be costly and time-consuming, or acquire a license on terms that are not favorable to us.Protecting or defending against such claims could significantly increase our costs, divert management’s time and attention away from other business matters.Global Operations - we have a broad footprint and global operations may present challenges.We have operations throughout the world. Our stability, growth and profitability are subject to a number of risks of doing business globally that could harm our business, including:•political and military events, including the rise of nationalism and support for protectionist policies,•tariffs, trade barriers and other trade restrictions,•legal and regulatory requirements, including import, export, defense regulations, anti-corruption laws, and foreign exchange controls,•potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations,•credit risk of local customers and distributors,•difficulties in protecting our intellectual property, and•local economic, political and social conditions.Due to the global reach of our operations, our business is subject to a complex system of commercial and trade laws, regulations and policies, including those related to data privacy, trade compliance, anti-corruption and anti-bribery. Our global subsidiaries, joint venture partners and affiliates are governed by laws, rules and business practices that differ from those of the U.S. Violations of such laws and regulations may result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations.The continued geographic expansion of our business increases our exposure to, and cost of complying with, these laws and regulations. If our compliance programs do not adequately prevent or deter our employees, agents, distributors, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business from violating anti-corruption laws, we may incur defense costs, fines, penalties, reputational damage and business disruptions.3Customer Concentration and Retention - a number of our customers operate in similar cyclical industries. Economic conditions in these industries could impact our sales.No customer accounted for ten percent or more of our net sales in fiscal 2019, 2018 or 2017. However, a number of our customers are concentrated in similar cyclical industries (e.g. construction, agriculture, mining, power generation and disk drives), resulting in additional risk based on industrial conditions in those sectors. A decline in the economic conditions of these industries could result in reduced demand for our products and difficulty in collecting amounts due from our customers. Our success is also dependent on retaining key customers, which requires us to successfully manage relationships and anticipate the needs of our customers in the channels in which we sell our products.Supply Chain - unavailable raw materials or significant demand fluctuations or material cost inflation.We obtain raw materials, including steel, filter media, petroleum-based products and other components, from third-party suppliers and tend to carry limited raw material inventories. We concentrate our sourcing of some materials from one supplier or a few suppliers. We rely on our suppliers to ensure they meet required quality standards. Our success is dependent on our ability to effectively manage our supplier relationships. Additionally, global supplier production capacity is limited and could be disrupted. We may experience significant disruption of the supply of raw materials, parts, components or final assemblies. An unanticipated delay in delivery by our suppliers could result in the inability to deliver our products on-time and meet the expectations of our customers. We could experience an increase in the costs of doing business, including increasing raw material commodity prices and transportation costs.Operations - inability to meet demand could result in the loss of customers.Our ability to fulfill customer orders is dependent on our manufacturing and distribution operations. Although we forecast demand, additional plant capacity takes months or even years to bring online, and thus changes in demand could result in longer lead times. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase manufacturing capacity to meet higher product demand, which could prevent us from meeting increased customer demand. However, if we overestimate our demand and overbuild our capacity, we may have underutilized assets. Efficient operations also require streamlining processes to maintain or reduce lead times, which we may not be capable of achieving. Unacceptable levels of service for key customers may result if we are not able to fulfill orders on a timely basis or if product quality or warranty or safety issues result from compromised production. We may not be able to adjust our production schedules to reflect changes in customer demand on a timely basis. Due to the complexity of our manufacturing operations, we may be unable to timely respond to fluctuations in demand.Technology Investments and Security Risks - vulnerability with our information technology systems and security.We have many information technology systems that are important to the operation of our business, some of which are managed by third parties. These systems are used to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. We could encounter difficulties in developing new systems, maintaining and upgrading our existing systems, managing access to these systems and preventing information security breaches. Vulnerabilities could lead to significant additional expenses and/or disruption in business operations.Additionally, information technology security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication. We have found and addressed these threats from time to time; however, to date none of them have been material. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Should such an attack succeed, it could lead to the compromising of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operations disruptions. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our reputation and could result in litigation, regulatory action, potential liability and increased costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection matters.Although the Company maintains insurance coverage for various cybersecurity and business continuity risks, there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured.Currency - an unfavorable fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates.We have operations in many countries, with a substantial portion of our annual revenue earned in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We face transactional and translational risks associated with the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Transactional risk arises from changes in the value of cash flows denominated in different currencies. This can be caused by supply chains that cross borders resulting in revenues and costs being in different currencies. Translational risk arises from the re-measurement of our financial statements. In addition, decreased value of local currency may make it difficult for some of our customers, distributors and end users to purchase our products. Each of our subsidiaries reports its results of operations and financial position in its relevant functional currency, which is then translated into U.S. dollars. This translated financial information is included in our consolidated financial statements. Significant fluctuations of the U.S. dollar in comparison to the foreign currencies of our subsidiaries during discrete periods may have a negative impact on our results and financial position. 4Legal and Regulatory - costs associated with lawsuits, investigations or complying with laws and regulations.We are subject to many laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We routinely incur costs in order to comply with these laws and regulations. We may be adversely impacted by new or changing laws and regulations that affect both our operations and our ability to develop and sell products that meet our customers’ requirements. We are involved in various product liability, product warranty, intellectual property, environmental claims and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business. We are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate, including those governing the environment (e.g. emissions to air; discharges to water; and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials) and data protection and privacy. It is not possible to predict the outcome of investigations and lawsuits, and we could incur judgments, fines, or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition in any particular period. In addition, we may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against any losses.Income Tax - changes in our effective tax rate in various jurisdictions.We are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and regulations. We are also subject to the prevailing tax laws and the continuous examination of our income tax returns by tax authorities. Personnel - our success may be affected if we are not able to attract, engage and retain qualified personnel.Our success depends in large part on our ability to identify, recruit, engage, train and retain highly skilled qualified and diverse personnel worldwide and successfully execute management transitions at leadership levels of the Company. There is competition for talent with market-leading skills and capabilities in new technologies. Additionally, in some locations we have experienced significant wage inflation due to a shortage of labor amid low levels of unemployment in these markets. We may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel and it may be difficult for us to compete effectively.Liquidity - changes in the capital and credit markets may negatively affect our ability to access financing to support strategic initiatives.Disruption of the global financial and credit markets may have an effect on our long-term liquidity and financial condition. There can be no assurance that the cost or availability of future borrowings will not be impacted by future capital market disruptions. Some of our existing borrowings contain covenants to maintain certain financial ratios that, under certain circumstances, could restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments and other restricted payments, create liens and sell assets. In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom (UK), the governing body responsible for regulating the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), announced that it no longer will compel or persuade financial institutions and panel banks to make LIBOR submissions after 2021. This decision is expected to result in the end of the use of LIBOR as a reference rate for commercial loans and other indebtedness. We have both LIBOR-denominated and Euro Interbank Offer Rate (EURIBOR)-denominated indebtedness or derivative instruments. The transition to alternatives to LIBOR could be modestly disruptive to the credit markets, and while we do not believe that the impact would be material to us, we do not yet have insight into what the impacts might be. Acquisitions - the execution of our acquisition strategy may not provide the desired return on investment.We have made and continue to pursue acquisitions. These acquisitions could negatively impact our profitability due to operating and integration inefficiencies, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and amortization of expenses related to intangible assets. There are also a number of other risks involved in acquisitions, including the potential loss of key customers, difficulties in assimilating the acquired operations, the loss of key employees and the diversion of management’s time and attention away from other business matters, that may prevent us from realizing the anticipated return on our investment.Impairment - if our operating units do not meet performance expectations, intangible assets could be subject to impairment.Our total assets include goodwill and other intangible assets from acquisitions. We review annually whether goodwill and other intangible assets have been impaired, or more frequently if there have been unexpected events or changes in circumstances.

There are inherent risks and uncertainties associated with our global operations that involve the technology development, manufacturing and sale of products for highly demanding customer applications throughout the world. These risks and uncertainties could adversely affect our operating performance and financial condition.

Any alleged or actual violations may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the U.S.The enforcement of bribery, corruption and trade laws and regulations is increasing in frequency and complexity on a global basis. The continued geographic expansion of our business increases our exposure to, and cost of complying with, these laws and regulations.

The results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability.Personnel - our success may be affected if we are not able to attract, engage and retain qualified personnel.Our success depends in large part on our ability to identify, recruit, engage and retain qualified and diverse personnel worldwide and successfully execute management transitions at leadership levels of the Company. Additionally, in some locations we have experienced significant wage inflation due to a shortage of labor amid low levels of unemployment in these markets. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, it may be difficult for us to compete effectively, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.5Liquidity - changes in the capital and credit markets may negatively affect our ability to access financing to support strategic initiatives.Disruption of the global financial and credit markets may have an effect on our long-term liquidity and financial condition. There can be no assurance that the cost or availability of future borrowings will not be impacted by future capital market disruptions. Some of our existing borrowings contain covenants to maintain certain financial ratios that, under certain circumstances, could restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments and other restricted payments, create liens and sell assets. Acquisitions - the execution of our acquisition strategy may not provide the desired return on investment.We have made and continue to pursue acquisitions. These acquisitions could negatively impact our profitability due to operating and integration inefficiencies, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and amortization of expenses related to intangible assets. There are also a number of other risks involved in acquisitions, including the potential loss of key customers, difficulties in assimilating the acquired operations, the loss of key employees and the diversion of management’s time and attention away from other business matters, that may prevent us from realizing the anticipated return on our investment.Impairment - if our operating units do not meet performance expectations, intangible assets could be subject to impairment.Our total assets include goodwill and other intangible assets from acquisitions. We review annually whether goodwill and other intangible assets have been impaired, or more frequently if there have been unexpected events or changes in circumstances. If future operating performance at one or more of our operating units were to fall significantly below forecast levels or if market conditions for one or more of our acquired businesses were to decline, we could be required to incur a non-cash charge to operating income for impairment. Any impairment charge would have an adverse non-cash impact on our results of operations and reduce our net worth.Productivity Improvements - if we do not successfully manage productivity improvements, we may not realize the expected benefits.Our financial projections assume certain ongoing productivity improvements as a key component of our business strategy to, among other things, contain operating expenses, increase operating efficiencies and align manufacturing capacity to demand. We may not be able to realize the expected benefits and cost savings if we do not successfully execute these plans while continuing to invest in business growth. If difficulties are encountered or such cost savings are otherwise not realized, it could adversely impact our results of operations.Business Disruption - unexpected events, including natural disasters, may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations. The occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including a terrorist attack, war or civil unrest, a weather event, an earthquake, pandemic or other catastrophe in the U.S. or in other countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Such event could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our headquarters, manufacturing facilities or distribution centers, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers, disruption in the transport of our products to customers and disruption of information systems. This could result in a prolonged disruption to our operations. Existing insurance coverage may not provide protection for all costs that may arise from such events. Any disruption in our manufacturing capacity could have an adverse impact on our ability to meet our customer needs or may require us to incur additional expenses in order to produce sufficient inventory, and therefore, may adversely affect our net sales and operating results.Internal Controls - if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results and prevent material fraud, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. Effective internal control over financial reporting, including controls within the information technology environment, is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent and detect material fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent or detect material fraud, our operating results could be misstated. There can be no assurances that we will be able to prevent future control deficiencies from occurring, which could cause us to incur unforeseen costs, negatively impact our results of operations, cause the market price of our common stock to decline or have other potential adverse consequences"
2,DCI,DONALDSON CO INC,2017-09-22,"Risk Factors
There are inherent risks and uncertainties associated with our global operations that involve the manufacturing and sale of products for highly demanding customer applications throughout the world. These risks and uncertainties could adversely affect our operating performance and financial condition. The following discussion, along with discussions elsewhere in this report, outlines the risks and uncertainties that we believe are the most material to our business at this time. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, unless required by law.Economic Environment - the demand for our products relies on economic and industrial conditions worldwide.Changes in economic or industrial conditions could impact our results or financial condition in any particular period as our business can be sensitive to varying conditions in all major geographies and markets. Products - maintaining a competitive advantage requires continuing investment with uncertain returns.We operate in highly competitive markets and have numerous competitors that may already be well-established in those markets. We expect our competitors to continue improving the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products that could be competitive in both price and performance. We believe that we have certain technological advantages over our competitors, but maintaining these advantages requires us to continually invest in research and development, sales and marketing and customer service and support. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in maintaining these advantages. We make investments in new technologies that address increased performance and regulatory requirements around the globe. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in completing development or achieving sales of these products or that the margins on such products will be acceptable. Our financial performance may be negatively impacted if a competitor’s successful product innovation reaches the market before ours or gains broader market acceptance. In addition, we may be adversely impacted by changes in technology that could reduce or eliminate the demand for our products. These risks include wider adoption of technologies providing alternatives to diesel engines.Competition - we participate in highly competitive markets with pricing pressure.The businesses and product lines in which we participate are very competitive and we risk losing business based on a wide range of factors, including price, technology, geographic coverage, product performance and customer service. Our customers continue to seek productivity gains and lower prices from us and their other suppliers. If we are not able to compete effectively, our margins and results of operations could be adversely affected.Intellectual Property - demand for our products may be affected by new entrants that copy our products and/or infringe on our intellectual property. The ability to protect and enforce intellectual property rights varies across jurisdictions. An inability to preserve our intellectual property rights may adversely affect our financial performance. Competitors and others may also initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our intellectual property or allege that we infringe their intellectual property. We may be required to pay substantial damages if it is determined our products infringe on their intellectual property. We may also be required to develop an alternative, non-infringing product that could be costly and time-consuming, or acquire a license on terms that are not favorable to us. Protecting or defending against such claims could significantly increase our costs, divert management’s time and attention away from other business matters and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Global Operations - operating globally carries risks that could negatively affect our financial performance.We have sales and manufacturing operations throughout the world. Our stability, growth and profitability are subject to a number of risks of doing business globally that could harm our business, including:•political and military events,•legal and regulatory requirements, including import, export, defense regulations, anti-corruption laws and foreign exchange controls,•tariffs, trade barriers and other trade restrictions,•potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations,3•credit risk of local customers and distributors,•difficulties in protecting our intellectual property, •natural disasters, terrorism, war or other catastrophic events and•local economic, political and social conditions, including in the Middle East, Ukraine, China, Thailand, South Korea and other emerging markets where we do business.Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations. Any alleged or actual violations may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the United States (U.S.). The enforcement of bribery, corruption and trade laws and regulations is increasing in frequency and complexity on a global basis. The continued geographic expansion of our business increases our exposure to, and cost of complying with, these laws and regulations. If our compliance programs do not adequately prevent or deter our employees, agents, distributors, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business from violating anti-corruption laws, we may incur defense costs, fines, penalties, reputational damage and business disruptions.Customer Concentration - a number of our customers operate in similar cyclical industries.  Economic conditions in these industries could have a negative impact on our financial performance.No customer accounted for ten percent or more of our net sales in fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015. However, a number of our customers are concentrated in similar cyclical industries (construction, agriculture and mining), resulting in additional risk based on industrial conditions in those sectors. A decline in the economic conditions of these industries could result in reduced demand for our products and difficulty in collecting amounts due from our customers.Supply Chain - unavailable or higher cost materials could impact our financial performance.We obtain raw materials, including steel, filter media, petroleum-based products and other components, from third-party suppliers and tend to carry limited raw material inventories. An unanticipated delay in delivery by our suppliers could result in the inability to deliver on-time and meet the expectations of our customers. An increase in commodity prices could also result in lower operating margins. Technology Investments and Security Risks - difficulties with our information technology systems and security could adversely affect our results.We have many information technology systems that are important to the operation of our business, some of which are managed by third parties. These systems are used to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. We could encounter difficulties in developing new systems, maintaining and upgrading our existing systems and preventing information security breaches. Such difficulties could lead to significant additional expenses and/or disruption in business operations that could adversely affect our results. Additionally, information technology security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Should such an attack succeed, it could lead to the compromising of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operations disruptions. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our reputation and could result in litigation, regulatory action, potential liability and increased costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection matters.Currency - an unfavorable fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely impact our results of operations.We have operations in many countries, with more than one-half of our annual revenue coming from countries outside of the U.S. Each of our subsidiaries reports its results of operations and financial position in its relevant functional currency, which is then translated into U.S. dollars. This translated financial information is included in our consolidated financial statements. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar in comparison to the foreign currencies of our subsidiaries has a negative impact on our results and financial position. In addition, decreased value of local currency may make it difficult for some of our customers, distributors and end users to purchase our products.Legal and Regulatory - costs associated with lawsuits, investigations or complying with laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.We are subject to many laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We routinely incur costs in order to comply with these laws and regulations. We may be adversely impacted by new or changing laws and regulations that affect both our operations and our ability to develop and sell products that meet our customers’ requirements. We are involved in various product liability, product warranty, intellectual property, environmental claims and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business. We are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in the countries 4in which we operate, including those governing emissions to air; discharges to water; and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. It is not possible to predict the outcome of investigations and lawsuits, and we could incur judgments, fines, or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition in any particular period. In addition, we may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against any losses.Income Tax - changes in our effective tax rate could adversely impact our net income.We are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and regulations. We are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by tax authorities. The results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability.Personnel - our success may be affected if we are not able to attract, develop and retain qualified personnel.Our success depends in large part on our ability to identify, recruit, develop and retain qualified personnel worldwide. If we are unable to meet this challenge, it may be difficult for us to execute our strategic objectives and grow our business, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Liquidity - changes in the capital and credit markets may negatively affect our ability to access financing. Disruption of the global financial and credit markets may have an effect on our long-term liquidity and financial condition. During fiscal 2017, credit in the global credit markets was accessible and market interest rates remained low. We believe that our current financial resources, together with cash generated by operations, are sufficient to continue financing our operations for the next twelve months. There can be no assurance, however, that the cost or availability of future borrowings will not be impacted by future capital market disruptions. Some of our existing borrowings contain covenants to maintain certain financial ratios that, under certain circumstances, could restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments and other restricted payments, create liens and sell assets. As of July 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants.The majority of our cash and cash equivalents are held by our foreign subsidiaries as over half of our earnings occur outside the U.S. Most of these funds are considered permanently reinvested outside the U.S., as the cash generated from U.S. operations plus our debt facilities are anticipated to be sufficient for our U.S. operation’s cash needs. If additional cash is required for our operations in the U.S., it may be subject to additional U.S. taxes if funds are repatriated from certain foreign subsidiaries.Acquisitions - the execution of our acquisition strategy may not provide the desired return on investment.We have made and continue to pursue acquisitions, including our acquisitions of Industrias Partmo S.A. (Partmo) and Hy-Pro Corporation (Hy-Pro) in fiscal 2017, Engineered Products Company (EPC) in fiscal 2016 and Northern Technical L.L.C. (Northern Technical) and IFIL USA L.L.C. (IFIL USA) in fiscal 2015. These acquisitions could negatively impact our profitability due to operating and integration inefficiencies, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to intangible assets. There are also a number of other risks involved in acquisitions, including the potential loss of key customers, difficulties in assimilating the acquired operations, the loss of key employees and the diversion of management’s time and attention away from other business matters.Impairment - if our operating units do not meet performance expectations, assets could be subject to impairment.Our total assets include goodwill from acquisitions. We test annually whether goodwill has been impaired, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the goodwill may be impaired. If future operating performance at one or more of our operating units were to fall significantly below forecast levels or if market conditions for one or more of our acquired businesses were to decline, we could be required to incur a non-cash charge to operating income for impairment. Any impairment in the value of our goodwill would have an adverse non-cash impact on our results of operations and reduce our net worth.Restructuring - if we do not successfully execute our restructuring plans and realize the expected benefits, our financial performance may be adversely affected.From time to time we have initiated restructuring programs related to our business strategy to, among other things, reduce operating expenses and align manufacturing capacity to demand. We may not be able to realize the expected benefits and cost savings if we do not successfully execute these plans. If difficulties are encountered or such cost savings are otherwise not realized, it could adversely impact our results of operations.5Internal Controls - if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results and prevent material fraud, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. Failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting resulted in a material weakness during fiscal 2015.Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent and detect material fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent or detect material fraud, our operating results could be misstated. Failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting resulted in a material weakness during fiscal 2015. Although we completed our remedial actions in response to this matter, there can be no assurances that we will be able to prevent future control deficiencies from occurring, which could cause us to incur unforeseen costs, negatively impact our results of operations, cause the market price of our common stock to decline or have other potential adverse consequences"

These risks and uncertainties could adversely affect our operating performance andfinancial condition. The following discussion, along with discussions elsewhere in this report, outlines the risks and uncertaintiesthat we believe are the most material to our business at this time. We want to further highlight the risks and uncertainties associatedwith: world economic factors and ongoing global economic uncertainty, currency fluctuations, commodity prices, political factors,our international operations, the continued implementation of our global ERP information technology system and other new informationtechnology systems, information security and data breaches, the reduced demand for hard disk drive products with the increaseduse of flash memory, highly competitive markets, governmental laws and regulations, including the impact of the various economicstimulus and financial reform measures, potential global events resulting in market instability including financial bailouts anddefaults of sovereign nations, military and terrorist activities, including conditions where we do business, other political changes,health outbreaks, natural disasters, and other factors discussed below. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or reviseany forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.Operating internationally carries risks which could negativelyaffect our financial performance.We have sales and manufacturingoperations throughout the world, with the heaviest concentrations in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. Our stability, growth, andprofitability are subject to a number of risks of doing business internationally that could harm our business, including:·political and military events,·legal and regulatory requirements, including import, export, defense regulations, anti-corruptionlaws, and foreign exchange controls,·tariffs and trade barriers,·potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations,·credit risk of local Customers and distributors,·difficulties in protecting our intellectual property,·local economic, political, and social conditions, specifically in the Middle East, Ukraine, China,Thailand, and other emerging markets where we do business,·trade restrictions in Latin American countries, specifically Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Venezuela,·potential global health outbreaks, and·natural disasters.Due to the internationalscope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations. Any alleged oractual violations may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation, and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our abilityto import or export our products or to provide services outside the 3 Table of Contents  United States (U.S.). In addition, the U.S. Foreign CorruptPractices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improperpayments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retainingbusiness, or obtaining an unfair advantage. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disruptour business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business, and results of operations or financial condition.Maintaining a competitive advantage requires continuing investmentwith uncertain returns.We operate in highly competitivemarkets and have numerous competitors who may already be well-established in those markets. We expect our competitors to continueimproving the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products that could be competitive in both price andperformance. We believe that we have certain technological advantages over our competitors, but maintaining these advantages requiresus to continually invest in research and development, sales and marketing, and Customer service and support. There is no guaranteethat we will be successful in maintaining these advantages. We make investments in new technologies that address increased performanceand regulatory requirements around the globe.

These risks include:·breakthroughs in technology which provide a viable alternative to diesel engines·reduced demand for hard disk drive products by flash memory or a similar technology, which wouldreduce the use of hard disk drives and therefore reduce the need for our filtration solutions in these disk drives·other breakthroughs in filtration technologies that could displace our productsDifficulties with our information technology systems and securitycould adversely affect our results.We have many informationtechnology systems that are important to the operation of our businesses, some of which are managed by third parties.

There may be other risks as we continue our multi-year implementation ofan enterprise resource planning system (Global ERP Project) on a worldwide basis. Such difficulties could lead to significantadditional expenses and/or disruption in business operations that could adversely affect our results. Additionally, informationtechnology security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systemsand networks and the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data. Should such an attack succeed, it could lead tothe compromising of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes, andoperations disruptions.

Large Customers continue to seek productivity gains andlower prices from us and their other suppliers. We may lose business or negatively impact our margins if we are unable to deliverthe best value to our Customers.Changes in our product mix impact our financial performance.We sell products that havevarying profit margins. Our financial performance can be impacted depending on the mix of products we sell during a given period.Our outlook assumes a certain geographic mix of sales as well as a product mix of sales. Ifactual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales, our results could be negatively impacted.Unavailable or higher cost materials could impact our financialperformance.We obtain raw materialsincluding steel, filter media, petroleum-based products, and other components from third-party suppliers and tend to carry limitedraw material inventories. An unanticipated delay in delivery by our suppliers could result in the inability to deliver on-timeand meet the expectations of our Customers. This could negatively affect our financial performance. An increase in commodityprices could also result in lower operating margins.An unfavorable fluctuation in foreign currencyexchange rates could negatively impacts our results and financial position.We have operations in manycountries, with more than one-half of our annual revenue coming from countries outside of the United States. Each of our subsidiariesreports its results of operations and financial position in its relevant functional currency, which is then translated into U.S.dollars. This translated financial information is included in our consolidated financial statements. Strengthening of the U.S.dollar in comparison to the foreign currencies of our subsidiaries has a negative impact on our results and financial position.Acquisitions may have an impact on our results.We have made and continueto pursue acquisitions, including our acquisitions of Northern Technical L.L.C. and IFIL USA L.L.C. in Fiscal 2015. These acquisitionscould negatively impact our profitability due to operating and integration inefficiencies, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities,and amortization expenses related to intangible assets. There are also a number of other risks involved in acquisitions. We couldlose key existing Customers, have difficulties in assimilating the acquired operations, assume unanticipated legal liabilities,or lose key Employees.Costs associated with lawsuits or investigations may have anadverse effect on our results of operations.We are subject to many lawsand regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We routinely incur costs in order to comply with these laws and regulations.We may be adversely impacted by new or changing laws and regulations that affect both our operations and our ability to developand sell products that meet our Customers’ requirements. We are involved in various productliability, product warranty, intellectual property, environmental claims, and other legal proceedings that arise in and outsideof the ordinary course of our business. It is not possible to predict the outcome of investigations and lawsuits, and we couldincur judgments, fines, or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on ourbusiness, results of operations, and financial condition in any particular period. Additional tax expense or tax exposure could impact our financialperformance.We are subject to incometaxes in various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among thesedifferent jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability could be adversely affected by numerous factors,including income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipatedin countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in taxlaws and regulations. We are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by tax authorities. The resultsof audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverseeffect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. 5 Table of Contents  Compliance with environmental and product laws and regulationscan be costly.We are subject to many environmentaland product laws and regulations in the jurisdiction we operate. We routinely incur costs in order to comply with these laws andregulations. We may be adversely impacted by new or changing laws and regulations that affect both our operations and our abilityto develop and sell products that meet our Customers’ requirements.If we fail to maintainan effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial resultsand prevent material fraud, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. Failure to maintain an effective systemof internal control over financial reporting resulted in a material weakness during fiscal 2015.Effective internal controlover financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent and detect materialfraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent or detect material fraud, our operating results could be misstated.In connection with reporting our results for fiscal 2015, we discovered that certain employees in our European Gas Turbine Productsbusiness falsified documents in a manner that caused revenue to be recorded in inappropriate periods during the fourth quarterof fiscal 2014 and the second and third quarters of fiscal 2015. Due to the inappropriate acceleration of revenue in the aforementionedperiods, revenue was also misstated in the first and fourth quarters of 2015. The recording of revenue in inappropriate periodswas the result of a control deficiency which constituted a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.There was also an indication that there may have been purposeful deferring of certain charges from suppliers to later time periodsthan appropriate, however, these allegations were not substantiated through the independent investigation performed. A materialweakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is areasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be preventedor detected on a timely basis. Management has determined that the misstatements in revenue were not material to the impacted periods.Although we are taking remedial actions in response to our discovery of these practices, including the termination of certain employees,there can be no assurances that we will be able to prevent future control deficiencies (including material weaknesses) from occurringand which could cause us to incur unforeseen costs, negatively impact our results of operations, cause the market price of ourcommon stock to decline, or have other potential adverse consequences"

Thereare inherent risks and uncertainties associated with our global operations that involve the manufacturing and sale of productsfor highly demanding Customer applications throughout the world. These risks and uncertainties could adversely affect our operatingperformance and financial condition. The following discussion, along with discussions elsewhere in this report, outlines the risksand uncertainties that we believe are the most material to our business at this time. We want to further highlight the risks anduncertainties associated with: world economic factors and conditions, the ongoing global economic uncertainty, the reduced demandfor hard disk drive products with the increased use of flash memory, the potential for some Customers to increase their relianceon their own filtration capabilities, currency fluctuations, commodity prices, political factors, our international operations,highly competitive markets, inability to hire and retain key employees, governmental laws and regulations, including the impactof the various economic stimulus and financial reform measures, the implementation of our new information technology systems, failureor breach of information technology and trade secret security, potential global events resulting in market instability, includingfinancial bailouts and defaults of sovereign nations, military and terrorist activities including political unrest in the MiddleEast, other political changes, health outbreaks, natural disasters, and other factors discussed below. We undertake no obligationto publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.Operating internationally carries risks which could negativelyaffect our financial performance.We have sales and manufacturingoperations throughout the world, with the heaviest concentrations in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. Our stability, growth, andprofitability are subject to a number of risks of doing business internationally that could harm our business, including:·political and military events,·legal and regulatory requirements, including import, export, defense regulations, anti-corruptionlaws, and foreign exchange controls,·tariffs and trade barriers,·potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations,·credit risk of local Customers and distributors,·difficulties in protecting intellectual property,·local economic, political, and social conditions, specifically in the Middle East, China, Thailand,and other emerging markets where we do business,·potential global health outbreaks, and·natural disasters.3Table of Contents Due to the internationalscope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations. Any alleged oractual violations may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation, and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our abilityto import or export our products or to provide services outside the United States (U.S.).  In addition, the U.S. Foreign CorruptPractices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improperpayments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retainingbusiness, or obtaining an unfair advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruptionlaws.  Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result inan adverse effect on our reputation, business, and results of operations or financial condition.Maintaining a competitive advantage requires continuing investmentwith uncertain returns.
