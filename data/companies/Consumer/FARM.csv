You should carefully consider each of the following factors, as well as the other information in this report, in evaluating our business and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also negatively affect our business operations, reputation, financial condition, results of operations or the trading price of our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline.Risks Related to our Business and IndustryDeterioration of global economic conditions, an economic recession, periods of inflation, rising interest rates, or economic uncertainty in our key markets may adversely affect customer and consumer spending, as well as demand for our products.Global economic conditions can be uncertain and volatile. Our business and results of operations have in the past been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions including inflation, interest rates, consumer spending rates, energy availability and costs, the negative impacts caused by public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the potential impacts of geopolitical uncertainties, and the effect of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. As global economic conditions continue to be volatile or economic uncertainty remains, trends in consumer spending also remain unpredictable and subject to reductions due to credit constraints and uncertainties about the future. Most of our products are purchased by our customers based on end-user demand from consumers. Some of the factors that may influence consumer spending include general economic conditions, high levels of unemployment, health crises, higher consumer debt levels, reductions in net worth based on market declines and uncertainty, home foreclosures and reductions in home values, fluctuating interest rates and credit availability, fluctuating fuel and other energy costs, inflationary pressure, tax rates, and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment. Unfavorable economic conditions may lead customers and consumers to delay or reduce purchases of our products and could present challenges in collecting our account receivables on a timely basis. Customer demand for our products may not reach our targets or may decline as distributors and retailers seek to reduce inventory positions if there is an economic downturn or economic uncertainty in our key markets. Economic cycles and related fluctuations in customer demand may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.We depend on the expertise of key personnel to operate our business. The unexpected loss of one or more of these key employees or difficulty recruiting and retaining qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations and competitive position.Our success depends on the efforts and abilities of key personnel and a consistent workforce, including frontline workers, support staff and executive team members. The competition for talent is extremely high and candidates’ preferences and expectations are evolving. We must continue to recruit, retain, motivate and develop management and other employees sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth and strategic initiatives. This may require us to adapt to evolving labor conditions and make significant investments in training, coaching and other career development and retention activities. Activities related to identifying, recruiting, hiring and integrating qualified individuals require significant time and attention. In this competitive environment, our business has been and may continue to be adversely impacted by increases in labor costs, including wages and benefits, including those increases triggered by regulatory actions regarding wages, scheduling and benefits; increased health care and workers’ compensation insurance costs; increased wages and costs of other benefits necessary to attract and retain high quality employees with the right skill sets. We may also need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract talented new employees and to invest in our 7employee experience and culture, and we may never realize returns on these investments. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our executive officers. If we are not able to effectively retain our talent, our ability to achieve certain strategic objectives may be adversely affected, which may impact our financial condition and results of operations. Further, any unplanned turnover or failure to develop or implement an adequate succession plan for our senior management and other key employees, could deplete our institutional knowledge base, erode our competitive advantage, and negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have undergone, and may continue to experience, changes to our executive leadership team and senior management, and our future success will depend in part on our ability to manage these transitions successfully. From time to time, there may be changes to our executive leadership team and senior management for various reasons, including as a result of the hiring, departure or realignment of key personnel. Such changes may adversely impact our operations, programs, growth, financial condition and results of operations. In 2022 and 2023, we had several changes to our executive leadership team and senior management as a result of organizational changes, including the departure of our chief sales officer and our chief supply chain officer. Any significant leadership change or senior management transition involves inherent risk and any failure to ensure the timely and suitable replacement and a smooth transition could hinder our strategic planning, business execution and future performance. In particular, these or any future leadership transitions may result in a loss of personnel with deep institutional or technical knowledge and changes in business strategy or objectives and have the potential to disrupt our operations and relationships with employees and customers due to added costs, operational inefficiencies, changes in strategy, decreased employee morale and productivity, and increased turnover. If we are unable to successfully manage changes to our executive leadership team and senior management, we could experience significant delays or difficulty in the achievement of our development and strategic objectives and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely harmed.Competition in the coffee industry and beverage category could impact our profitability or harm our competitive position.The coffee industry is highly competitive, including with respect to price, product quality, service, convenience, technology and innovation, and competition could become more intense due to the relatively low barriers to entry and industry consolidation. We face competition from many sources, including the institutional foodservice divisions of multi-national manufacturers of retail products, wholesale foodservice distributors, regional and national coffee roasters, specialty coffee suppliers, and retail brand beverage manufacturers, many of which have greater financial and other resources than we do and may have lower fixed costs and/or are substantially less leveraged than us. As many of our customers are small foodservice operators, we also compete with cash and carry and club stores and on-line retailers. Companies smaller than ours may be more innovative, better able to bring new products to market and better able to quickly exploit and serve niche markets.We consider our roasting and blending methods essential to the flavor and richness of our coffees and, therefore, essential to our brand. Because our roasting methods cannot be patented, we would be unable to prevent competitors from copying these methods if such methods became known. In addition, competitors may be able to develop roasting or blending methods that are more advanced than our production methods, which may also harm our competitive position.Increased competition in coffee or other beverage channels may have an adverse impact on sales of our products. If we do not succeed in differentiating ourselves through, among other things, our product and service offerings, or if we are not effective in setting proper pricing, then our competitive position may be weakened, we could fail to retain our existing customer base and our sales and profitability may be materially adversely affected.Increases in the cost of green coffee could reduce our gross margin and profit and may increase volatility in our results.Our primary raw material is green coffee, an exchange-traded agricultural commodity that is subject to price fluctuations. Our ability to acquire a consistent supply of green coffee at prices sufficient to meet our needs, similar to any agricultural commodity, may be impacted by, among other things, climate change, weather, natural disasters, real or perceived supply shortages, crop disease (such as coffee rust) and pests, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, an increase in green coffee purchased and sold on a negotiated basis rather than directly on commodity markets in response to higher production costs relative to “C” market prices, speculative trading in coffee commodities, political and economic conditions or uncertainty, labor actions and shortages, foreign currency fluctuations, inflation, armed conflict in coffee producing nations, acts of terrorism, pandemics or other disease outbreaks (including the COVID-19 pandemic), government actions and trade barriers or tariffs, and the actions of producer organizations that have historically attempted to influence green coffee prices through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. Additionally, specialty green coffees tend to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “C” market price which premium, depending on the supply and demand at the time of purchase, may be significant. We purchase over-the-counter coffee-related derivative instruments to enable us to lock in the price of green coffee commodity purchases on our behalf or at the direction of our customers under commodity-based pricing arrangements. Although we account for certain coffee-related derivative instruments as accounting hedges, the portion of open hedging contracts that are not designated as accounting hedges 8are marked to period-end market price and unrealized gains or losses based on whether the period-end market price was higher or lower than the price we locked-in are recognized in our financial results at the end of each reporting period. Depending on contractual restrictions, we may be unable to pass these costs to our customers by increasing the price of products. If we are unable to increase prices sufficiently to offset increased input costs, or if our sales volume decreases significantly as a result of price increases, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.Recently, there has been increased volatility in the “C” market price, with prices at times increasing to five-year highs. The uncertainty of several factors, including the impact of weather patterns in coffee producing regions, global supply chain constraints and shipping shortages, and speculative trading, has caused greater uncertainty in the markets. Specifically, severe frosts and drought in Brazil currently threaten to negatively impact crop yields for multiple harvests, which could reduce supply and increase cost. Although we hedge the ""C"" market price volatility for a portion of our green coffee volumes by using derivative instruments, our hedging strategy and use of these instruments does not completely mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk. As a result, increases in the cost of green coffee could have a material adverse impact on our profitability, financial condition or results of operations. Our accounts receivable represents a significant portion of our current assets increasing our exposure to bad debts and counter-party risk which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Adverse changes in general economic conditions and/or contraction in global credit markets could precipitate liquidity problems among our debtors. In addition, certain of our debtors use third-party distributors or do business through a network of affiliate entities which can make collection efforts more challenging and, at times, collections may be economically unfeasible. Any increase in our exposure to losses from bad debts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Climate change, water scarcity or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address such could have a material adverse effect our business and operations.Increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse effect on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters. In the event that climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity in the regions from which we procure coffee, we could be subject to decreased availability and increased prices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Water is used throughout the production of coffee from growing and pulping at the farm, cooling the beans after roasting in production and brewing products for consumption. Scarcity of appropriate and sufficient water sources in our supply chain could limit supply and increase our costs. Loss of readily available access to water could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.The increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional, federal, foreign and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. In the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy and resource efficiency, we may experience significant increases in our manufacturing and distribution costs. In particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the supply chain and distribution costs associated with our products. As a result, climate change or increased concern over climate change could negatively affect our business and operations. Increased severe weather conditions, including those resulting from climate change, may increase commodity costs, damage our facilities and disrupt our production capabilities and supply chain.There is increasing concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have caused and will continue to cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events. Severe weather conditions are dramatically affecting coffee growing countries. The wet and dry seasons are becoming unpredictable in timing and duration, causing improper development of the coffee cherries. Decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions as a result of changing weather patterns may affect the quality, limit the availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities, which are important ingredients for our products. We have experienced storm-related damages and disruptions to our operations in the recent past related to both winter storms as well as heavy rainfall and flooding. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could damage our facilities, impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations.9Investment in acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, not result in the anticipated benefits and present risks not originally contemplated.We have invested, and in the future may invest, in acquisitions which may involve significant risks and uncertainties. The success of any such acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to realize all or some of the anticipated benefits from integrating the acquired businesses with our existing businesses, and to achieve revenue and cost synergies. Additionally, any such acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of additional debt, restructuring charges, impairment charges, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses related to intangible assets, and increased operating expenses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that any such acquisitions will be identified or that we will be able to consummate any such acquisitions on terms favorable to us or at all, or that the synergies from any such acquisitions will be achieved. If any such acquisitions are not successful, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.Our operating results may have significant fluctuations from period to period which could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.Our operating results may fluctuate from period to period as a result of a number of factors, including variations in our operating performance or the performance of our competitors, changes in accounting principles, fluctuations in the price and supply of green coffee, fluctuations in the selling prices of our products, the success of our hedging strategy, research reports and changes in financial estimates by analysts about us, or competitors or our industry, our inability or the inability of our competitors to meet analysts’ projections or guidance, strategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, capital investments or changes in business strategy, the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock, adverse outcomes of litigation, changes in or uncertainty about economic conditions, inflation, supply chain disruptions, conditions or trends in our industry, geographies, or customers, activism by any large stockholder or group of stockholders, speculation by the investment community regarding our business, actual or anticipated growth rates relative to our competitors, terrorist acts, natural disasters, including due to the effects of climate change, perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives, competition, changes in consumer preferences and market trends, seasonality, our ability to retain and attract customers, our ability to manage inventory and fulfillment operations and maintain gross margin, and other factors described elsewhere in this risk factors section. Fluctuations in our operating results due to these factors or for any other reason could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Accordingly, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance.We may be subject to securities litigation, class action and derivative lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and could divert management attention away from other business concerns.The market price of our common stock may be volatile and, in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Even if the lawsuits are without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business. An adverse judgment could result in monetary damages, which could have a negative impact on our liquidity and financial condition.We may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and consumer demographics, which may result in decreased demand for our products.Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing tastes, dietary habits and product packaging preferences of consumers in the market categories in which we compete. If we are not able to anticipate, identify or develop and market products that respond to these changes in consumer preferences, whether resulting from changing consumer demographics or otherwise, demand for our products may decline and our operating results may be adversely affected. In addition, we may incur significant costs related to developing and marketing new products or expanding our existing product lines in reaction to what we perceive to be increased consumer preference or demand. Such development or marketing may not result in the volume of sales or profitability anticipated.We face exposure to other commodity cost fluctuations, which could impact our margins and profitability.In addition to green coffee, we are exposed to cost fluctuations in other commodities under supply arrangements, including raw materials, tea, spices, and packaging materials such as carton board, corrugate and plastic. We are also exposed to fluctuations in the cost of fuel. We purchase certain ingredients, finished goods and packaging materials under cost-plus supply arrangements whereby our costs may increase based on an increase in the underlying commodity price or changes in production costs. The cost of these commodities, raw materials and fuel depend on various factors beyond our control, including economic and political conditions, foreign currency fluctuations, inflation, weather conditions, natural disasters (including floods, droughts, frosts, earthquakes and hurricanes) and changing global climate patterns. The changes in the prices we pay may take place on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis depending on the product and supplier. Unlike green coffee, we do not purchase 10any derivative instruments to hedge cost fluctuations in these other commodities. As a result, to the extent we are unable to pass along such costs to our customers through price increases, our margins and profitability will decrease.Our efforts to secure an adequate supply of quality coffees and other raw materials may be unsuccessful and impact our ability to supply our customers or expose us to commodity price risk.Maintaining a reliable supply of green coffee is essential to keeping inventory levels low while securing sufficient stock to meet customer needs. We rely upon our ongoing relationships with our key suppliers to support our operations. Some of the Arabica coffee beans we purchase do not trade directly on the commodity markets. Rather, we purchase these coffee beans on a negotiated basis from coffee brokers, exporters and growers. If any of these supply relationships deteriorate or we are unable to renegotiate contracts with suppliers (with similar or more favorable terms) or find alternative sources for supply, we may be unable to procure a sufficient quantity of high-quality coffee beans and other raw materials at prices acceptable to us or at all which could negatively affect our results of operations. Further, non-performance by suppliers could expose us to supply risk under coffee purchase commitments for delivery in the future. In addition, the political situation in many of the Arabica coffee growing regions, including Africa, Indonesia, and Central and South America, can be unstable, and such instability could affect our ability to purchase coffee from those regions. If green coffee beans from a region become unavailable or prohibitively expensive, we could be forced to use alternative coffee beans or discontinue certain blends, which could adversely impact our sales.  Any material interruption in our supply chain, such as material interruption of roasted coffee supply due to the casualty loss at any of our roasting plants or suppliers, interruptions in service by our third-party logistic service providers or common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels, trade restrictions, such as increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes or customs restrictions, pandemics, social or labor unrest, natural disasters or political disputes and military conflicts that cause a material disruption in our supply chain could have a negative impact on our business and our profitability. Product shortages could result in disruptions in our ability to deliver products to our customers, a deterioration of our relationship with our customers, decreased revenues or an inability to expand our business.  Interruption or increased costs of our supply chain and sales network or labor force, including a disruption in operations at any of our production and distribution facilities, could affect our ability to manufacture or distribute products and could adversely affect our business and sales.Our sales and distribution network requires a large investment to maintain and operate, and we rely on a limited number of production and distribution facilities. We also operate a large fleet of trucks and other vehicles to distribute and deliver our products through our DSD network, and we rely on 3PL service providers for our long-haul distribution. Certain products are also distributed by third parties or direct shipped via common carrier. Many of these costs are beyond our control, and many are fixed rather than variable.There are potential adverse effects of labor disputes with our own employees or with others who provide warehousing, co-packing, transportation (lines, truck drivers, 3PL service providers) or cargo handling (longshoremen), both domestic and foreign, of our raw materials or other products. We have union contracts relating to a portion of our workforce. Although we believe union relations have been amicable in the past, there is no assurance that this will continue in the future or that we will not be subject to future union organizing activity. The terms and conditions of existing, renegotiated or new collective bargaining agreements could also increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency or to adapt to changing business needs or strategy.In addition, we use a significant amount of electricity, gasoline, diesel and oil, natural gas and other energy sources to operate our production and distribution facilities. An increase in the price, disruption of supply or shortage of fuel and other energy sources that may be caused by increased demand, inflation or by events such as climate change, natural disasters, power outages, cyberattacks or the like, could lead to higher electricity, transportation and other commodity costs, including the pass-through of such costs under our agreements with 3PL service providers and other suppliers, that could negatively impact our profitability, financial condition or results of operations.A disruption in operations at any of these facilities or any other disruption in our supply chain or increase in prices relating to service by our 3PL service providers, common carriers or distributors, service technicians or vendor-managed inventory arrangements, or otherwise, whether as a result of casualty, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorism, labor shortages, shipping costs, trade restrictions, contractual disputes, weather, environmental incident, interruptions in port operations or highway arteries, increased downtime due to certain aging production infrastructure, pandemic, strikes, work stoppages, the financial or operational instability of key suppliers, distributors and transportation providers, or other causes, could significantly impair our ability to operate our business, adversely affect our relationship with our customers, and impact our financial condition or results of operations. If our vendors fail to meet our standards, provide products in a timely and efficient manner, or comply with applicable laws, these issues could have a material negative impact on our business and profitability.11We rely on co-packers to provide our supply of tea, spice, culinary and other products. Any failure by co-packers to fulfill their obligations or any termination or renegotiation of our co-pack agreements could adversely affect our results of operations.We have a number of supply agreements with co-packers that require them to provide us with specific finished goods, including tea, spice and culinary products. For some of our products we primarily rely upon a single co-packer as our sole-source for the product. The failure for any reason of any such sole-source or other co-packer to fulfill its obligations under the applicable agreements with us, including the failure by our co-packers to comply with food safety, environmental, or other laws and regulations, or the termination or renegotiation of any such co-pack agreement could result in disruptions to our supply of finished goods, cause damage to our reputation and brands, and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, our co-packers are subject to risk, including labor disputes, union organizing activities, financial liquidity, inclement weather, natural disasters, pandemics, supply constraints, and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable products, which could disrupt our supply of finished goods, or require that we incur additional expense by providing financial accommodations to the co-packer or taking other steps to seek to minimize or avoid supply disruption, such as establishing a new co-pack arrangement with another provider. A new co-pack arrangement may not be available on terms as favorable to us as our existing co-pack arrangements, or at all.Customer quality control problems or food safety issues may adversely affect our brands thereby negatively impacting our sales or leading to potential product recalls or product liability claims.Selling products for human consumption involves inherent legal risks. Our success depends on our ability to provide customers with high-quality products and service. Although we take measures to ensure that we sell only fresh products, we have no control over our products once they are purchased by our customers. Clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee, tea and other beverages. We have no ability to ensure that our customers use a clean water supply to prepare these beverages.  Instances or reports of food safety issues involving our products, whether or not accurate, such as unclean water supply, food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, contamination, mislabeling, or other food or beverage safety issues, including due to the failure of our third-party co-packers to maintain the quality of our products and to comply with our product specifications, could damage the value of our brands, negatively impact sales of our products, and potentially lead to product recalls, production interruptions, product liability claims, litigation or damages. A significant product liability claim against us, whether or not successful, or a widespread product recall may reduce our sales and harm our business.Consumers have been increasingly focused on food safety and health and wellness with respect to the food products they buy. Particularly in the U.S., there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks, including obesity, as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food and beverage products. While we have a variety of such products, an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products, whether accurate or not, imposition of additional taxes on certain types of food and beverage components, or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our products and could materially harm our business and results of operations.Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable net income may be subject to certain limitations.At June 30, 2023, the Company had approximately $133.9 million in federal net operating loss carryforwards that will begin to expire in the tax year ending June 30, 2027 and $173.1 million in state net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in the tax year ending June 30, 2024. Net operating losses of $78.9 million in federal and $10.3 million of state are indefinite lived and will not expire. If an ownership change as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the ""Code""), occurs with respect to our capital stock, our ability to use net operating losses (""NOLs"") to offset taxable income would be subject to certain limitations. Generally, an ownership change occurs under Section 382 of the Code if certain persons or groups increase their aggregate ownership by more than 50 percentage points of our total capital stock over a rolling three-year period. If an ownership change occurs, our ability to use NOLs to reduce taxable net income is generally limited to an annual amount based on the fair market value of our stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt interest rate. If an ownership change were to occur, use of our NOLs to reduce payments of federal taxable net income may be deferred to later years within the 20-year carryover period; however, if the carryover period for any loss year expires, the use of the remaining NOLs for the loss year will be prohibited. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code and limit our ability to use NOLs to offset taxable income. There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire, decrease in value or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. As a result, we may be unable to realize a tax benefit from the use of our NOLs, even if we generate a sufficient level of taxable net income prior to the expiration of the NOL carry forward periods.12Future impairment charges could adversely affect our operating results.Acquisitions are based on certain target analysis and due diligence procedures designed to achieve a desired return or strategic objective. These procedures often involve certain assumptions and judgment in determining the acquisition price. After consummation of an acquisition, unforeseen issues could arise that adversely affect anticipated returns or that are otherwise not recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price. Even after careful integration efforts, actual operating results may vary significantly from initial estimates. We perform an asset impairment analysis on an annual basis or whenever events occur that may indicate possible existence of impairment. Failure to achieve forecasted operating results, due to weakness in the economic environment or other factors, changes in market conditions, loss of or significant decline in sales to customers included in valuation of the intangible asset, changes in our imputed cost of capital, and declines in our market capitalization, among other things, could result in impairment of our intangible assets and adversely affect our operating results. There were no intangible asset impairments during fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022.Our business could be negatively impacted by corporate citizenship and sustainability matters.There is an increased focus from certain investors, customers, consumers, employees, and other stakeholders concerning corporate citizenship and sustainability matters. From time to time, we announce certain initiatives regarding our focus areas, which include environmental matters, sustainability in our supply chain, responsible sourcing, social investments and inclusion and diversity. We could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such initiatives or goals, or we could fail in accurately reporting our progress on such initiatives and goals. Such failures could be due to changes in our business (e.g., shifts in business among distribution channels or acquisitions). Moreover, the standards by which citizenship and sustainability efforts and related matters are measured are developing and evolving, and certain areas are subject to assumptions and standards that could change over time. Any such matters, or related corporate citizenship and sustainability matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business.The performance of required transition services following the Sale may divert our resources and distract our management, which could harm our ability to optimize our continuing operations and successfully implement our post-Sale business strategy.As described above, in connection with the Sale, we agreed to a mutual transitional co-manufacturing agreement pursuant to which we will manufacture certain products for Buyer and Buyer will manufacture certain products for us for an initial period of twelve months. We are also providing Buyer with certain transition services for an initial period of nine months. In order to perform our obligations under these transition-related agreements, we must allocate certain of our resources, including assets, facilities, equipment, and the time and attention of our senior management team, to ensure a smooth transition of the businesses sold, which may negatively impact our own business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Difficulties in separating the operations, logistics, technologies and IT infrastructure of the divested business from those of our continuing businesses may require substantially more time and funds than we anticipated in negotiating the terms of our transition-related agreements with Buyer. If we are unsuccessful at executing our business plan and the necessary transition activities following the Sale, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected and our ability to invest in and grow our business could be limited.We have completed the sale of certain of our assets in the past, and may explore additional sales of our assets, and such divestitures may introduce significant risks and uncertainties.Our strategic review resulted in the Sale, and we may engage in additional divestitures in the future. Divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. These include, among others, the inability to find buyers or complete transactions on favorable terms, disruption to our business and/or diversion of management attention from other business concerns. Significant time and expenses have been and could in the future be incurred to divest the assets described above, which may adversely affect operations as dispositions have required and may in the future require our continued financial involvement, such as through transition service agreements, guarantees, and indemnities or other current or contingent financial obligations and liabilities.Risks Related to Governance, Regulatory, Legislative and Legal MattersGovernment regulations affecting the conduct of our business could increase our operating costs, reduce demand for our products or result in litigation.The conduct of our business is subject to various laws and regulations including those relating to food safety, ingredients, manufacturing, processing, packaging, storage, marketing, advertising, labeling, quality and distribution of our products, import of raw materials, as well as environmental laws and regulations relating to climate change and sustainability, and those relating to privacy, worker health and workplace safety. These laws and regulations and interpretations thereof are subject to change as a result of political, economic or social events. In addition, our product advertising could make us the target of claims relating to false or deceptive advertising under U.S. federal and state laws, including the consumer protection statutes of some states. Any new laws and regulations or changes in government policy, existing laws and regulations or the interpretations thereof 13could require us to change certain of our operational processes and procedures, or implement new ones, and may increase our operating and compliance costs, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, modifications to international trade policy, or the imposition of increased or new tariffs, quotas or trade barriers on key commodities, could adversely impact our business and results of operations. In some cases, increased regulatory scrutiny could interrupt distribution of our products or force changes in our production processes or procedures (or force us to implement new processes or procedures). In addition, compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws, including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, could require us to reduce emissions and to incur compliance costs which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products. If we or our business partners fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to litigation, civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties, increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and adversely affect our reputation and brand image. In addition, claims or liabilities of this sort may not be covered by insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have against others.We could face significant withdrawal liability if we withdraw from participation in the multiemployer pension plans in which we participate.We participate in one multiemployer defined benefit pension plan and nine multiemployer defined contribution plans other than pension plans for certain union employees. We make periodic contributions to these plans to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants. Our required contributions to these plans could increase due to a number of factors, including the funded status of the plans and the level of our ongoing participation in these plans. Our risk of such increased payments may be greater if any of the participating employers in these underfunded plans withdraws from the plan due to insolvency and we are not able to contribute an amount sufficient to fund the unfunded liabilities associated with its participants in the plan. In the event we withdraw from participation in one or more of these plans, we could be required to make an additional lump-sum contribution to the plan. Our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer pension plan would depend on the extent of the plan’s funding of vested benefits. The amount of any potential withdrawal liability could be material to our results of operations and cash flows.Litigation pending against us could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation.We are currently party to various legal and other proceedings, and additional claims may arise in the future. See Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10‑K. Regardless of the merit of particular claims, litigation may be expensive, time-consuming, operationally disruptive and distracting to management, and could negatively affect our brand name and image and subject us to statutory penalties and costs of enforcement. We can provide no assurances as to the outcome of any litigation or the resolution of any other claims against us. An adverse outcome of any litigation or other claim could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.We are partially self-insured and our current coverage and reserves may not be sufficient to cover future claims.We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liability of certain risks up to varying deductible amounts. The premiums associated with our insurance continue to increase. General liability, fire, workers’ compensation, directors’ and officers’ liability, life, employee medical, dental and vision, and automobile risks present significant potential liabilities. While we accrue for these potential liabilities based on historical claims experience, future claims may exceed claims we have incurred in the past. Should a different number of claims occur compared to what was estimated or the cost of the claims increase beyond what was anticipated, reserves recorded may not be sufficient and the accruals may need to be adjusted accordingly in future periods. A successful claim against us that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of our reserves or available insurance limits could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We maintain finished goods product coverage in amounts we believe to be adequate. However, we cannot assure you that we will not incur claims or liabilities for which we are not insured or that exceed the amount of our insurance coverage.  Moreover, claims or liabilities of this sort might not be covered by our insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have against others. A product liability judgment against us or a product recall or the damage to our reputation resulting therefrom could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.Risks Related to our Capital Structure and Ownership of Our Common StockAn increase in our debt leverage could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.In April 2021, we entered into a new senior secured credit facility composed of a revolver credit facility (the ""Revolver Credit Facility"" or the ""Credit Facility"") and a term credit facility agreement (the “Term Credit Facility”) (See Liquidity for 14details). On June 30, 2023, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into that certain Consent and Amendment No. 4 to Credit Agreement (the “Fourth Amendment”), with the lenders party thereto, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent for each member of the lender group. The Fourth Amendment amends that certain Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), originally entered into by and among the parties on April 26, 2021, as amended by that certain Consent and Amendment No. 1 to Credit Agreement, dated December 20, 2021, that certain Increase Joinder and Amendment No. 2 to Credit Agreement, dated August 8, 2022 and that certain Amendment No. 3 to Credit Agreement (“Amendment No. 3”), dated August 31, 2022.. The Fourth Amendment includes a consent to the Sale by the administrative agent and the lenders and amends certain terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement by, among other things: (i) reflecting the payoff in full, with proceeds from the Sale, of the $47.0 million outstanding amount of the term loan issued pursuant to Amendment No. 3, (ii) reflecting the paydown, with proceeds from the Sale, of the Revolver Credit Facility (and a reduction of the maximum commitment of the lenders under the Revolver Credit Facility to $75.0 million), (iii) releasing liens of the administrative agent securing the obligations under the Credit Agreement on assets sold pursuant to the Sale, and (iv) amending the Credit Agreement so that the Company's financial covenant (i.e., fixed charge coverage ratio) is only in effect during such times when the Company's liquidity falls below certain thresholds. At June 30, 2023, we had outstanding borrowings of $23.0 million and utilized $4.0 million of the letters of credit sublimit under the Credit Facility, and had $35.8 million of availability under our Credit Facility. We may incur significant indebtedness in the future, including through additional borrowings under the Credit Facility, through the issuance of debt securities, or otherwise.Our present indebtedness and any future borrowings could have adverse consequences, including:•requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness;•reducing the cash flow available or limiting our ability to borrow additional funds, to pay dividends, to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to pursue our business strategies;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate;•limiting our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all;•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.To the extent we become more leveraged, we face an increased likelihood that one or more of the risks described above would materialize.  The Credit Facility contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and restrictions that, among other things, require the Company to satisfy certain financial covenants and restricts the Company's and its subsidiaries' ability to incur additional debt, pay dividends and make distributions, make certain investments and acquisitions, repurchase its stock and prepay certain indebtedness, create liens, enter into agreements with affiliates, modify the nature of its business, transfer and sell material assets and merge or consolidate. Non-compliance with one or more of the covenants and restrictions could result in the full or partial principal balance of the Credit Facility becoming immediately due and payable and termination of the commitments. If we are unable to make payments as they come due or comply with the restrictions and covenants under the Credit Facility or any other agreements governing our indebtedness, there could be a default under the terms of such agreements. In such event, or if we are otherwise in default under the Credit Facility or any such other agreements, the lenders could terminate their commitments to lend and/or accelerate the loans and declare all amounts borrowed due and payable. If our liquidity materially declines, we may experience springing covenants and an increase in our cost of borrowing. Furthermore, our lenders under the Credit Facility could foreclose on their security interests in our assets. If any of those events occur, our assets might not be sufficient to repay in full all of our outstanding indebtedness and we may be unable to find alternative financing on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to maintain existing or secure new financing could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial position.Our liquidity has been adversely affected as a result of our operating performance in recent periods and may be further materially adversely affected by constraints in the capital and credit markets and limitations under our financing arrangements.We need sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements, service our outstanding indebtedness and finance business opportunities. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail our operations, or we may not be able to pursue business opportunities. The principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities, available cash, our credit facility, and proceeds from the sale of assets. In recent periods, significant acquisition costs, large capital investments along with the underperformance of our business has resulted in a decrease in funds from operating activities, which has weakened our liquidity position. Should our operating performance deteriorate further, we will have less cash inflows from operations available to meet our financial obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs. Deterioration of our operating performance may also result in a 15reduction in our working capital, which could negatively impact our available borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility. In addition, if such deterioration were to lead to the closure of leased facilities, we would need to fund the costs of terminating those leases. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future to satisfy these financial obligations, we may be required to, among other things:•seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;•refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness;•sell assets; and/or•reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures, strategic acquisitions or investments.Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to satisfy our financial obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, and could impede the implementation of our business strategy, prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business and/or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all. Our ability to obtain additional financing or refinance our indebtedness would depend upon, among other things, our financial condition at the time, and the liquidity of the overall capital markets and the state of the economy. Furthermore, any refinancing of our existing debt could be at higher interest rates and may require compliance with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, if our lenders experience difficulties that render them unable to fund future draws on the credit facility, we may not be able to access all or a portion of these funds, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and pursue our business strategies. In addition, covenants in our debt agreements could restrict or delay our ability to respond to business opportunities, or in the event of a failure to comply with such covenants, could result in an event of default, which if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on us.We may require additional financing to achieve our goals, and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, may force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product manufacturing and development, and other operations.We may require additional financing to fund our operations or growth. The failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on our continued development or growth. The amount of additional capital we may require, the timing of our capital needs and the availability of financing to fund those needs will depend on a number of factors, including our strategic initiatives and operating plans, the performance of our business, the number, complexity and characteristics of additional products or future manufacturing processes we require to serve new or existing markets, any material or significant product recalls, any failure or disruption with our manufacturing and co-packing partners as well as our third party logistics providers, the expansion into new markets, any changes in our regulatory or legislative landscape, particularly with respect to product safety, advertising, product labeling and data privacy, the costs associated with being a public company and the market conditions for debt or equity financing. Additionally, the amount of capital required will depend on our ability to meet our sales goals and otherwise successfully execute our operating plan. We intend to continually monitor and adjust our operating plan as necessary to respond to developments in our business, our markets and the broader economy and it is possible that our business could become more capital intensive. Although we believe that our Credit Facility, together with our cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements in the near term, arrangements for additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, when needed. Additionally, any such arrangements may require significant cash payments for interest and other costs or could be highly dilutive to our existing shareholders, and may not provide us with sufficient funds to meet our long-term capital requirements.Inflationary pressures may adversely affect us by increasing costs of raw materials, labor, and other costs beyond what we can recover through price increases.Inflation can adversely affect us by increasing the costs of raw materials, labor, and other costs required to operate and grow our business. Many of the markets in which we sell our products are experiencing high levels of inflation, which may depress consumer demand for our products and reduce our profitability if we are unable to raise prices enough to keep up with increases in our costs. Inflationary pressures have resulted in increases in the cost of certain raw materials, and other supplies necessary for the production of our products, and such increases may continue to impact us in the future and expose us to risks associated with significant levels of cost inflation. If we are unable to increase our prices to offset the effects of inflation, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.                              Anti-takeover provisions or stockholder dilution could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us.Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares without any further vote or action by stockholders. We currently have 500,000 authorized shares of preferred stock undesignated as to series, and we could cause shares currently designated as to series but not outstanding to become undesignated and available for issuance as a series of preferred stock to be designated in the future. The rights of the holders of our common stock may be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, 16the rights of the holders of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of the Company without further action by stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.Further, certain provisions of our organizational documents have provisions eliminating the ability of stockholders to take action by written consent, and provisions limiting the ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of stockholders without giving advance notice, may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of the Company, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, our organizational documents do not permit cumulative voting, which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our Board of Directors. Further, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which will prohibit us from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, even if such combination is favored by a majority of stockholders, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. The application of Section 203 also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or management.Volatility in the equity markets or interest rate fluctuations could substantially increase our pension funding requirements and negatively impact our financial position.As of June 30, 2023, the projected benefit obligation under our two employer defined benefit pension plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets. The difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets, or the funded status of the plans, significantly affects the net periodic benefit cost and ongoing funding requirements of those plans. Among other factors, changes in interest rates, mortality rates, early retirement rates, mix of plan asset investments, investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the level of plan funding, cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost, increase our future funding requirements and require payments to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. In addition, facility closings may trigger cash payments or previously unrecognized obligations under our defined benefit pension plans, and the cost of such liabilities may be significant or may compromise our ability to close facilities or otherwise conduct cost reduction initiatives on time and within budget. A significant increase in future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.Actions of activist stockholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management's attention and resources, and have an adverse effect on our business.We have been and may continue to be subject to proposals by stockholders urging us to take certain corporate actions. Responding to proxy contests and reacting to other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, and can disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and employees. If activist stockholder activities continue, our business could be adversely affected. For example, we have been and may continue to be required to retain the services of various professionals to advise us on activist stockholder matters, including legal, financial, and communications advisers, the costs of which may negatively impact our future financial results. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy or leadership created as a consequence of activist stockholder initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, harm our ability to attract new investors, customers, employees, suppliers and other strategic partners, and cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.If securities analysts or industry analysts downgrade our stock, publish negative research or reports or do not publish reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.The trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us, our business and our industry. If one or more analysts adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock or our competitors’ stock, our stock price may likely decline. If one or more analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Risks Related to Cybersecurity and Data PrivacyFailure to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain privacy and data protections laws and regulations may subject us to substantial negative financial consequences and civil or criminal penalties.Complex local, state, national, foreign and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal data. These privacy and data protection laws and regulations are quickly evolving, with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations and enforcement. In addition, our legal and regulatory obligations in jurisdictions outside the U.S. are subject to unexpected changes, including the potential for regulatory or other governmental 17entities to enact new or additional laws or regulations, to issue rulings that invalidate prior laws or regulations or to increase penalties significantly. Complying with these laws and regulations can be costly and can impede the development and offering of new products and services.Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations to which we may be subject relating to personal data, or to protect personal data from unauthorized access, use or other processing, could result in enforcement actions and regulatory investigations against us, claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals, fines, damage to our brand reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance and business.We rely on information technology and software in our operations. Any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could affect our ability to effectively operate our business.Our ability to effectively manage our business, maintain information accuracy and efficiency, comply with regulatory, financial reporting, legal and tax requirements, and coordinate the production, distribution and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability, capacity and integrity of information technology systems, software and networks. We are also dependent on enterprise resource planning software for some of our information technology systems and support. The failure of these systems to operate effectively and continuously for any reason could result in delays in processing replenishment orders from our branch warehouses, an inability to record input costs or product sales accurately or at all, an impaired understanding of our operations and results, an increase in operating expenses, reduced operational efficiency, loss of customers or other business disruptions, all of which could negatively affect our business and results of operations. To date, we have not experienced a material breach of cyber security, however our computer systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subjected to unauthorized access or phishing attempts, computer viruses, malware, ransomware or other malicious codes. While we have implemented training and information security policies for our team members and bolstered cybersecurity experience on our board, these measures may be insufficient to prevent against the constantly evolving threats. These threats increase the difficulty of timely detection and successful defense. As a result, security, backup, disaster recovery, administrative and technical controls, and incident response measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to prevent cyber-attacks or other security breaches to our systems. Failure to effectively allocate and manage our resources to build, sustain, protect and upgrade our information technology infrastructure could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, reputational damage, litigation, business disruptions, or the loss of sensitive or confidential data through security breach or otherwise. Significant capital investments could be required to remediate any potential problems or to otherwise protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. In addition, if our customers or suppliers experience a security breach or system failure, their businesses could be disrupted or negatively affected, which may result in a reduction in customer orders or disruption in our supply chain, which would adversely affect our results of operations.Failure to prevent the unauthorized access, use, theft or destruction of personal, financial and other confidential information relating to our customers, suppliers, employees or our Company, could damage our business reputation, negatively affect our results of operations, and expose us to potential liability.The protection of our customer, supplier, employee, and Company data and confidential information is critical. We are subject to new and changing privacy and information security laws and standards that may require significant investments in technology and new operational processes. The use of electronic payment methods and collection of other personal information exposes us to increased risk of privacy and/or security breaches. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools, and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting, and storing personal information from individuals, including our customers, suppliers and employees, and our security measures may not effectively prohibit others from obtaining improper access to such information. We rely on third party, cloud based technologies which results in third party access and storage of Company data and confidential information. Employees or third parties with whom we do business or to whom we outsource certain information technology or administrative services may attempt to circumvent security measures in order to misappropriate such information, and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. If we experience a data security breach of any kind or fail to respond appropriately to such incidents, we may experience a loss of or damage to critical data, suffer financial or reputational damage or penalties, or face exposure to negative publicity, government investigations and proceedings, private consumer or securities litigation, liability or costly response measures. In addition, our reputation within the business community and with our customers and suppliers may be affected, which could result in our customers and suppliers ceasing to do business with us which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our insurance policies do not cover losses caused by security breaches.We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which, in turn, could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business.Our ability to implement our business plan successfully depends in part upon our ability to further build brand recognition, including for our proprietary products, using our trademarks, service marks and other proprietary intellectual property, including our names and logos. We have registered or applied to register a number of our trademarks. We cannot assure investors that our trademark applications will be approved. Third parties may also oppose our trademark applications, or 18otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our goods and services, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands. If our efforts to register, maintain and protect our intellectual property are inadequate, or if any third party misappropriates, dilutes or infringes upon our intellectual property, the value of our brands may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and might prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance.We may also face the risk of claims that we have infringed third parties’ intellectual property rights. If third parties claim that we have infringed or are infringing upon their intellectual property rights, our operating profits could be affected in a materially adverse manner. Any claims of intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend, require us to rebrand our services, if feasible, divert management’s attention and resources or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party’s intellectual property. Any royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. A successful claim of infringement against us could result in our being required to pay significant damages, enter into costly license or royalty agreements, or stop the sale of certain products or services, any of which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations and could harm our future prospects"
4,FARM,FARMER BROS CO,2022-09-02,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
You should carefully consider each of the following factors, as well as the other information in this report, in evaluating our business and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also negatively affect our business operations, reputation, financial condition, results of operations or the trading price of our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline.Risks Related to our Business and IndustryPandemics or disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may disrupt our business, including among other things, our supply chain, our manufacturing operations and customer and consumer demand for our products, and could have a material adverse impact on our business.In fiscal years 2022 and 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic had a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The measures taken to contain the spread of the virus adversely affected our business and those of our customers. The outbreak resulted in federal, state and local government authorities implementing numerous restrictive measures to attempt to contain COVID-19, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and shutdowns. These measures impacted our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, and those of our respective vendors and suppliers. The resurgences of COVID-19 or new variants of the virus may result in the reinstitution of certain of the restrictions and increased economic uncertainty, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  The ultimate impact that the COVID-19 pandemic or any future pandemic or disease outbreak will have on our business and our consolidated results of operations is uncertain. The spread of pandemics or disease outbreaks such as COVID-19 may also disrupt our third-party business partners’ ability to meet their obligations to us, which may negatively affect our operations. These third parties include those who supply our ingredients, packaging, and other necessary operating materials, and logistics and transportation providers. In addition, we rely on customers to be able to receive shipments and stock store shelves. If a significant percentage of our workforce or the workforce of our third-party business partners or customers is unable to work, including because of illness or travel or government restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic or any future pandemic or disease outbreak, our operations may be negatively impacted. In addition, the unprecedented demand for food and other consumer packaged goods products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or any future pandemic may limit the availability of ingredients, packaging and other raw 7materials necessary to produce our products, and our operations may be negatively impacted. For example, we have experienced supply chain constraints for certain of our products, which have negatively impacted our ability to fully satisfy customer and consumer demand for certain of our products. Additionally, pandemics or disease outbreaks could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect economies and financial markets, consumer spending and confidence levels resulting in an economic downturn that could affect customer and consumer demand for our products.Our efforts to manage and mitigate these factors may be unsuccessful, and the effectiveness of these efforts depends on factors beyond our control, including the duration and severity of any pandemic or disease outbreak, as well as third-party actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate public health effects.The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business will depend on many factors, including, among others, the implementation and duration of social distancing and stay-at-home and work-from-home mandates, policies and recommendations and whether, and the extent to which, additional waves or variants of COVID-19 will affect the United States and the rest of North America, our ability and the ability of our suppliers to continue to operate our and their manufacturing facilities and maintain the supply chain without material disruption and procure ingredients, packaging and other raw materials when needed despite disruptions in the supply chain and labor shortages, our customers’ ability to adequately staff their distribution centers and stores, and the extent to which macroeconomic conditions resulting from the pandemic impact consumer eating and shopping habits. We cannot predict the duration or scope of the disruption. Therefore, the financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.We depend on the expertise of key personnel to operate our business. The unexpected loss of one or more of these key employees or difficulty recruiting and retaining qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations and competitive position.Our success depends on the efforts and abilities of key personnel and a consistent workforce, including frontline workers, support staff and executive team members. The competition for talent is extremely high and candidates’ preferences and expectations are evolving. We must continue to recruit, retain, motivate and develop management and other employees sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth and strategic initiatives. This may require us to adapt to evolving labor conditions and make significant investments in training, coaching and other career development and retention activities. Activities related to identifying, recruiting, hiring and integrating qualified individuals require significant time and attention. In this competitive environment, our business has been and may continue to be adversely impacted by increases in labor costs, including wages and benefits, including those increases triggered by regulatory actions regarding wages, scheduling and benefits; increased health care and workers’ compensation insurance costs; increased wages and costs of other benefits necessary to attract and retain high quality employees with the right skill sets and increased wages, benefits and costs related to the effects of COVID-19 pandemic. We may also need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract talented new employees and to invest in our employee experience and culture, and we may never realize returns on these investments. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our executive officers. If we are not able to effectively retain our talent, our ability to achieve certain strategic objectives may be adversely affected, which may impact our financial condition and results of operations. Further, any unplanned turnover or failure to develop or implement an adequate succession plan for our senior management and other key employees, could deplete our institutional knowledge base, erode our competitive advantage, and negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Competition in the coffee industry and beverage category could impact our profitability or harm our competitive position.The coffee industry is highly competitive, including with respect to price, product quality, service, convenience, technology and innovation, and competition could become more intense due to the relatively low barriers to entry and industry consolidation. We face competition from many sources, including the institutional foodservice divisions of multi-national manufacturers of retail products, wholesale foodservice distributors, regional and national coffee roasters, specialty coffee suppliers, and retail brand beverage manufacturers, many of which have greater financial and other resources than we do and may have lower fixed costs and/or are substantially less leveraged than us. As many of our customers are small foodservice operators, we also compete with cash and carry and club stores and on-line retailers. Companies smaller than ours may be more innovative, better able to bring new products to market and better able to quickly exploit and serve niche markets.We consider our roasting and blending methods essential to the flavor and richness of our coffees and, therefore, essential to our brand. Because our roasting methods cannot be patented, we would be unable to prevent competitors from copying these methods if such methods became known. In addition, competitors may be able to develop roasting or blending methods that are more advanced than our production methods, which may also harm our competitive position.Increased competition in coffee or other beverage channels may have an adverse impact on sales of our products. If we do not succeed in differentiating ourselves through, among other things, our product and service offerings, or if we are not 8effective in setting proper pricing, then our competitive position may be weakened, we could fail to retain our existing customer base and our sales and profitability may be materially adversely affected.Increases in the cost of green coffee could reduce our gross margin and profit and may increase volatility in our results.Our primary raw material is green coffee, an exchange-traded agricultural commodity that is subject to price fluctuations. Our ability to acquire a consistent supply of green coffee at prices sufficient to meet our needs, similar to any agricultural commodity, may be impacted by, among other things, climate change, weather, natural disasters, real or perceived supply shortages, crop disease (such as coffee rust) and pests, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, an increase in green coffee purchased and sold on a negotiated basis rather than directly on commodity markets in response to higher production costs relative to “C” market prices, speculative trading in coffee commodities, political and economic conditions or uncertainty, labor actions and shortages, foreign currency fluctuations, inflation, armed conflict in coffee producing nations, acts of terrorism, pandemics or other disease outbreaks (including the COVID-19 pandemic), government actions and trade barriers or tariffs, and the actions of producer organizations that have historically attempted to influence green coffee prices through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. Additionally, specialty green coffees tend to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “C” market price which premium, depending on the supply and demand at the time of purchase, may be significant. We purchase over-the-counter coffee-related derivative instruments to enable us to lock in the price of green coffee commodity purchases on our behalf or at the direction of our customers under commodity-based pricing arrangements. Although we account for certain coffee-related derivative instruments as accounting hedges, the portion of open hedging contracts that are not designated as accounting hedges are marked to period-end market price and unrealized gains or losses based on whether the period-end market price was higher or lower than the price we locked-in are recognized in our financial results at the end of each reporting period. Depending on contractual restrictions, we may be unable to pass these costs to our customers by increasing the price of products. If we are unable to increase prices sufficiently to offset increased input costs, or if our sales volume decreases significantly as a result of price increases, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.Recently, there has been increased volatility in the “C” market price, with prices at times increasing to five-year highs. The uncertainty of several factors, including the impact of weather patterns in coffee producing regions, global supply chain constraints and shipping shortages, and speculative trading, has caused greater uncertainty in the markets. Specifically, severe frosts and drought in Brazil currently threaten to negatively impact crop yields for multiple harvests, which could reduce supply and increase cost. Although we hedge the ""C"" market price volatility for a portion of our green coffee volumes by using derivative instruments, our hedging strategy and use of these instruments does not completely mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk. As a result, increases in the cost of green coffee could have a material adverse impact on our profitability, financial condition or results of operations. Loss of business from one or more of our large national account customers and efforts by these customers to improve their profitability could have a material adverse effect on our operations.We have a number of large national account customers, the loss of or reduction in sales to one or more of which would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. During fiscal 2022, our top five customers accounted for approximately 24% of our net sales. We generally do not have long-term contracts with the majority of our customers. Accordingly, the majority of our customers can stop purchasing our products at any time without penalty and are free to purchase products from our competitors. There can be no assurance that our customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as they have in the past. In addition, because of the competitive environment facing many of our customers and industry consolidation which has produced large customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength, our customers have increasingly sought to improve their profitability through pricing concessions and more favorable trade terms. To the extent we provide pricing concessions or favorable trade terms, our margins would be reduced. If we are unable to continue to offer terms that are acceptable to our customers, they may reduce purchases of our products which would adversely affect our financial performance. Requirements that may be imposed on us by our customers, such as sustainability, inventory management or product specification requirements, may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, our customers may face financial difficulties, bankruptcy or other business disruptions that may impact their operations and their purchases from us and may affect their ability to pay us for products which could adversely affect our sales and profitability.Our accounts receivable represents a significant portion of our current assets and a substantial portion of our trade accounts receivables relate principally to a limited number of customers, increasing our exposure to bad debts and counter-party risk which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.A significant portion of our accounts receivable are from five customers, which represents approximately 35% of our accounts receivable at June 30, 2022. The concentration of our accounts receivable across a limited number of parties subjects us to individual counter-party and credit risk as these parties may breach our agreement, claim that we have breached the 9agreement, become insolvent and/or declare bankruptcy, delaying or reducing our collection of receivables or rendering collection impossible altogether. Certain of the parties use third-party distributors or do business through a network of affiliate entities which can make collection efforts more challenging and, at times, collections may be economically unfeasible. Adverse changes in general economic conditions and/or contraction in global credit markets could precipitate liquidity problems among our debtors. This could increase our exposure to losses from bad debts and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Climate change, water scarcity or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address such could have a material adverse effect our business and operations.Increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse effect on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters. In the event that climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity in the regions from which we procure coffee, we could be subject to decreased availability and increased prices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Water is used throughout the production of coffee from growing and pulping at the farm, cooling the beans after roasting in production and brewing products for consumption. Scarcity of appropriate and sufficient water sources in our supply chain could limit supply and increase our costs. Loss of readily available access to water could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.The increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional, federal, foreign and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. In the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy and resource efficiency, we may experience significant increases in our manufacturing and distribution costs. In particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the supply chain and distribution costs associated with our products. As a result, climate change or increased concern over climate change could negatively affect our business and operations. Increased severe weather conditions, including those resulting from climate change, may increase commodity costs, damage our facilities and disrupt our production capabilities and supply chain.There is increasing concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have caused and will continue to cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events. Severe weather conditions are dramatically affecting coffee growing countries. The wet and dry seasons are becoming unpredictable in timing and duration, causing improper development of the coffee cherries. Decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions as a result of changing weather patterns may affect the quality, limit the availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities, which are important ingredients for our products. We have experienced storm-related damages and disruptions to our operations in the recent past related to both winter storms as well as heavy rainfall and flooding. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could damage our facilities, impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations.Investment in acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, not result in the anticipated benefits and present risks not originally contemplated.We have invested, and in the future may invest, in acquisitions which may involve significant risks and uncertainties. The success of any such acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to realize all or some of the anticipated benefits from integrating the acquired businesses with our existing businesses, and to achieve revenue and cost synergies. Additionally, any such acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of additional debt, restructuring charges, impairment charges, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses related to intangible assets, and increased operating expenses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that any such acquisitions will be identified or that we will be able to consummate any such acquisitions on terms favorable to us or at all, or that the synergies from any such acquisitions will be achieved. If any such acquisitions are not successful, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.Our operating results may have significant fluctuations from period to period which could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.Our operating results may fluctuate from period to period as a result of a number of factors, including variations in our operating performance or the performance of our competitors, changes in accounting principles, fluctuations in the price and supply of green coffee, fluctuations in the selling prices of our products, the success of our hedging strategy, research reports and changes in financial estimates by analysts about us, or competitors or our industry, our inability or the inability of our competitors to meet analysts’ projections or guidance, strategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, capital 10investments or changes in business strategy, the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock, adverse outcomes of litigation, changes in or uncertainty about economic conditions, inflation, supply chain disruptions, conditions or trends in our industry, geographies, or customers, activism by any large stockholder or group of stockholders, speculation by the investment community regarding our business, actual or anticipated growth rates relative to our competitors, terrorist acts, natural disasters, including due to the effects of climate change, perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives, competition, changes in consumer preferences and market trends, seasonality, our ability to retain and attract customers, our ability to manage inventory and fulfillment operations and maintain gross margin, and other factors described elsewhere in this risk factors section. Fluctuations in our operating results due to these factors or for any other reason could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition, the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market price of equity securities issued by many companies. In the past, some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to class action or derivative lawsuits. The filing of a lawsuit against us, regardless of the outcome, could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as it could result in substantial legal costs, a diversion of management’s attention and resources, and require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments or to settle litigation. Accordingly, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance.We may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and consumer demographics, which may result in decreased demand for our products.Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing tastes, dietary habits and product packaging preferences of consumers in the market categories in which we compete. If we are not able to anticipate, identify or develop and market products that respond to these changes in consumer preferences, whether resulting from changing consumer demographics or otherwise, demand for our products may decline and our operating results may be adversely affected. In addition, we may incur significant costs related to developing and marketing new products or expanding our existing product lines in reaction to what we perceive to be increased consumer preference or demand. Such development or marketing may not result in the volume of sales or profitability anticipated.We face exposure to other commodity cost fluctuations, which could impact our margins and profitability.In addition to green coffee, we are exposed to cost fluctuations in other commodities under supply arrangements, including raw materials, tea, spices, and packaging materials such as carton board, corrugate and plastic. We are also exposed to fluctuations in the cost of fuel. We purchase certain ingredients, finished goods and packaging materials under cost-plus supply arrangements whereby our costs may increase based on an increase in the underlying commodity price or changes in production costs. The cost of these commodities, raw materials and fuel depend on various factors beyond our control, including economic and political conditions, foreign currency fluctuations, inflation, weather conditions, natural disasters (including floods, droughts, frosts, earthquakes and hurricanes) and changing global climate patterns. The changes in the prices we pay may take place on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis depending on the product and supplier. Unlike green coffee, we do not purchase any derivative instruments to hedge cost fluctuations in these other commodities. As a result, to the extent we are unable to pass along such costs to our customers through price increases, our margins and profitability will decrease.Our efforts to secure an adequate supply of quality coffees and other raw materials may be unsuccessful and impact our ability to supply our customers or expose us to commodity price risk.Maintaining a reliable supply of green coffee is essential to keeping inventory levels low while securing sufficient stock to meet customer needs. We rely upon our ongoing relationships with our key suppliers to support our operations. Some of the Arabica coffee beans we purchase do not trade directly on the commodity markets. Rather, we purchase these coffee beans on a negotiated basis from coffee brokers, exporters and growers. If any of these supply relationships deteriorate or we are unable to renegotiate contracts with suppliers (with similar or more favorable terms) or find alternative sources for supply, we may be unable to procure a sufficient quantity of high-quality coffee beans and other raw materials at prices acceptable to us or at all which could negatively affect our results of operations. Further, non-performance by suppliers could expose us to supply risk under coffee purchase commitments for delivery in the future. In addition, the political situation in many of the Arabica coffee growing regions, including Africa, Indonesia, and Central and South America, can be unstable, and such instability could affect our ability to purchase coffee from those regions. If green coffee beans from a region become unavailable or prohibitively expensive, we could be forced to use alternative coffee beans or discontinue certain blends, which could adversely impact our sales.  Any material interruption in our supply chain, such as material interruption of roasted coffee supply due to the casualty loss at any of our roasting plants or suppliers, interruptions in service by our third-party logistic service providers or common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels, trade restrictions, such as increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes or customs restrictions, pandemics, social or labor unrest, natural disasters or political disputes and military conflicts that cause a material disruption in our supply chain could have a negative impact on our business and our profitability. Product shortages could result in disruptions in our ability to deliver products to our customers, a deterioration of our relationship with our customers, decreased revenues or an inability to expand our business.  11Interruption or increased costs of our supply chain and sales network or labor force, including a disruption in operations at any of our production and distribution facilities, could affect our ability to manufacture or distribute products and could adversely affect our business and sales.Our sales and distribution network requires a large investment to maintain and operate, and we rely on a limited number of production and distribution facilities. We also operate a large fleet of trucks and other vehicles to distribute and deliver our products through our DSD network, and we rely on 3PL service providers for our long-haul distribution. Certain products are also distributed by third parties or direct shipped via common carrier. Many of these costs are beyond our control, and many are fixed rather than variable.There are potential adverse effects of labor disputes with our own employees or by others who provide warehousing, transportation (lines, truck drivers, 3PL service providers) or cargo handling (longshoremen), both domestic and foreign, of our raw materials or other products. We have union contracts relating to a portion of our workforce. Although we believe union relations have been amicable in the past, there is no assurance that this will continue in the future or that we will not be subject to future union organizing activity. The terms and conditions of existing, renegotiated or new collective bargaining agreements could also increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency or to adapt to changing business needs or strategy.In addition, we use a significant amount of electricity, gasoline, diesel and oil, natural gas and other energy sources to operate our production and distribution facilities. An increase in the price, disruption of supply or shortage of fuel and other energy sources that may be caused by increased demand, inflation or by events such as climate change, natural disasters, power outages, cyberattacks or the like, could lead to higher electricity, transportation and other commodity costs, including the pass-through of such costs under our agreements with 3PL service providers and other suppliers, that could negatively impact our profitability, financial condition or results of operations.A disruption in operations at any of these facilities or any other disruption in our supply chain or increase in prices relating to service by our 3PL service providers, common carriers or distributors, service technicians or vendor-managed inventory arrangements, or otherwise, whether as a result of casualty, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorism, labor shortages, shipping costs, trade restrictions, contractual disputes, weather, environmental incident, interruptions in port operations or highway arteries, increased downtime due to certain aging production infrastructure, pandemic, strikes, work stoppages, the financial or operational instability of key suppliers, distributors and transportation providers, or other causes, could significantly impair our ability to operate our business, adversely affect our relationship with our customers, and impact our financial condition or results of operations. If our vendors fail to meet our standards, provide products in a timely and efficient manner, or comply with applicable laws, these issues could have a material negative impact on our business and profitability.We rely on co-packers to provide our supply of tea, spice, culinary and other products. Any failure by co-packers to fulfill their obligations or any termination or renegotiation of our co-pack agreements could adversely affect our results of operations.We have a number of supply agreements with co-packers that require them to provide us with specific finished goods, including tea, spice and culinary products. For some of our products we primarily rely upon a single co-packer as our sole-source for the product. The failure for any reason of any such sole-source or other co-packer to fulfill its obligations under the applicable agreements with us, including the failure by our co-packers to comply with food safety, environmental, or other laws and regulations, or the termination or renegotiation of any such co-pack agreement could result in disruptions to our supply of finished goods, cause damage to our reputation and brands, and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, our co-packers are subject to risk, including labor disputes, union organizing activities, financial liquidity, inclement weather, natural disasters, pandemics, supply constraints, and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable products, which could disrupt our supply of finished goods, or require that we incur additional expense by providing financial accommodations to the co-packer or taking other steps to seek to minimize or avoid supply disruption, such as establishing a new co-pack arrangement with another provider. A new co-pack arrangement may not be available on terms as favorable to us as our existing co-pack arrangements, or at all.Customer quality control problems or food safety issues may adversely affect our brands thereby negatively impacting our sales or leading to potential product recalls or product liability claims.Selling products for human consumption involves inherent legal risks. Our success depends on our ability to provide customers with high-quality products and service. Although we take measures to ensure that we sell only fresh products, we have no control over our products once they are purchased by our customers. Clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee, tea and other beverages. We have no ability to ensure that our customers use a clean water supply to prepare these beverages.  Instances or reports of food safety issues involving our products, whether or not accurate, such as unclean water supply, food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, contamination, mislabeling, or other food or beverage safety issues, including due to the 12failure of our third-party co-packers to maintain the quality of our products and to comply with our product specifications, could damage the value of our brands, negatively impact sales of our products, and potentially lead to product recalls, production interruptions, product liability claims, litigation or damages. A significant product liability claim against us, whether or not successful, or a widespread product recall may reduce our sales and harm our business.Consumers have been increasingly focused on food safety and health and wellness with respect to the food products they buy. Particularly in the U.S., there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks, including obesity, as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food and beverage products. While we have a variety of such products, an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products, whether accurate or not, imposition of additional taxes on certain types of food and beverage components, or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our products and could materially harm our business and results of operations.Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable net income may be subject to certain limitations.At June 30, 2022, the Company had approximately $185.9 million in federal and $160.1 million in state net operating loss carryforwards that will begin to expire in the years ending June 30, 2038 and June 30, 2023, respectively. Net operating losses of $51.8 million in federal and $6.9 million of state are indefinite lived and will not expire. If an ownership change as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the ""Code""), occurs with respect to our capital stock, our ability to use net operating losses (""NOLs"") to offset taxable income would be subject to certain limitations. Generally, an ownership change occurs under Section 382 of the Code if certain persons or groups increase their aggregate ownership by more than 50 percentage points of our total capital stock over a rolling three-year period. If an ownership change occurs, our ability to use NOLs to reduce taxable net income is generally limited to an annual amount based on the fair market value of our stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt interest rate. If an ownership change were to occur, use of our NOLs to reduce payments of federal taxable net income may be deferred to later years within the 20-year carryover period; however, if the carryover period for any loss year expires, the use of the remaining NOLs for the loss year will be prohibited. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code and limit our ability to use NOLs to offset taxable income. There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire, decrease in value or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. As a result, we may be unable to realize a tax benefit from the use of our NOLs, even if we generate a sufficient level of taxable net income prior to the expiration of the NOL carry forward periods.Future impairment charges could adversely affect our operating results.Acquisitions are based on certain target analysis and due diligence procedures designed to achieve a desired return or strategic objective. These procedures often involve certain assumptions and judgment in determining the acquisition price. After consummation of an acquisition, unforeseen issues could arise that adversely affect anticipated returns or that are otherwise not recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price. Even after careful integration efforts, actual operating results may vary significantly from initial estimates. We perform an asset impairment analysis on an annual basis or whenever events occur that may indicate possible existence of impairment. Failure to achieve forecasted operating results, due to weakness in the economic environment or other factors, changes in market conditions, loss of or significant decline in sales to customers included in valuation of the intangible asset, changes in our imputed cost of capital, and declines in our market capitalization, among other things, could result in impairment of our intangible assets and adversely affect our operating results. There were no intangible asset impairments during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021.Our business could be negatively impacted by corporate citizenship and sustainability matters.There is an increased focus from certain investors, customers, consumers, employees, and other stakeholders concerning corporate citizenship and sustainability matters. From time to time, we announce certain initiatives regarding our focus areas, which include environmental matters, sustainability in our supply chain, responsible sourcing, social investments and inclusion and diversity. We could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such initiatives or goals, or we could fail in accurately reporting our progress on such initiatives and goals. Such failures could be due to changes in our business (e.g., shifts in business among distribution channels or acquisitions). Moreover, the standards by which citizenship and sustainability efforts and related matters are measured are developing and evolving, and certain areas are subject to assumptions and standards that could change over time. Any such matters, or related corporate citizenship and sustainability matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business.13Risks Related to Governance, Regulatory, Legislative and Legal MattersGovernment regulations affecting the conduct of our business could increase our operating costs, reduce demand for our products or result in litigation.The conduct of our business is subject to various laws and regulations including those relating to food safety, ingredients, manufacturing, processing, packaging, storage, marketing, advertising, labeling, quality and distribution of our products, import of raw materials, as well as environmental laws and regulations relating to climate change and sustainability, and those relating to privacy, worker health and workplace safety. These laws and regulations and interpretations thereof are subject to change as a result of political, economic or social events. In addition, our product advertising could make us the target of claims relating to false or deceptive advertising under U.S. federal and state laws, including the consumer protection statutes of some states. Any new laws and regulations or changes in government policy, existing laws and regulations or the interpretations thereof could require us to change certain of our operational processes and procedures, or implement new ones, and may increase our operating and compliance costs, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, modifications to international trade policy, or the imposition of increased or new tariffs, quotas or trade barriers on key commodities, could adversely impact our business and results of operations. In some cases, increased regulatory scrutiny could interrupt distribution of our products or force changes in our production processes or procedures (or force us to implement new processes or procedures). In addition, compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws, including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, could require us to reduce emissions and to incur compliance costs which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products. If we or our business partners fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to litigation, civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties, increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and adversely affect our reputation and brand image. In addition, claims or liabilities of this sort may not be covered by insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have against others.We could face significant withdrawal liability if we withdraw from participation in the multiemployer pension plans in which we participate.We participate in one multiemployer defined benefit pension plan and nine multiemployer defined contribution plans other than pension plans for certain union employees. We make periodic contributions to these plans to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants. Our required contributions to these plans could increase due to a number of factors, including the funded status of the plans and the level of our ongoing participation in these plans. Our risk of such increased payments may be greater if any of the participating employers in these underfunded plans withdraws from the plan due to insolvency and we are not able to contribute an amount sufficient to fund the unfunded liabilities associated with its participants in the plan. In the event we withdraw from participation in one or more of these plans, we could be required to make an additional lump-sum contribution to the plan. Our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer pension plan would depend on the extent of the plan’s funding of vested benefits. The amount of any potential withdrawal liability could be material to our results of operations and cash flows.Litigation pending against us could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation.We are currently party to various legal and other proceedings, and additional claims may arise in the future. See Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10‑K. Regardless of the merit of particular claims, litigation may be expensive, time-consuming, operationally disruptive and distracting to management, and could negatively affect our brand name and image and subject us to statutory penalties and costs of enforcement. We can provide no assurances as to the outcome of any litigation or the resolution of any other claims against us. An adverse outcome of any litigation or other claim could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.We are partially self-insured and our current coverage and reserves may not be sufficient to cover future claims.We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liability of certain risks up to varying deductible amounts. The premiums associated with our insurance continue to increase. General liability, fire, workers’ compensation, directors’ and officers’ liability, life, employee medical, dental and vision, and automobile risks present significant potential liabilities. While we accrue for these potential liabilities based on historical claims experience, future claims may exceed claims we have incurred in the past. Should a different number of claims occur compared to what was estimated or the cost of the claims increase beyond what was anticipated, reserves recorded may not be sufficient and the accruals may need to be adjusted accordingly in future periods. A successful claim against us that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of our reserves or available insurance limits could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.14We maintain finished goods product coverage in amounts we believe to be adequate. However, we cannot assure you that we will not incur claims or liabilities for which we are not insured or that exceed the amount of our insurance coverage.  Moreover, claims or liabilities of this sort might not be covered by our insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have against others. A product liability judgment against us or a product recall or the damage to our reputation resulting therefrom could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.Risks Related to our Capital StructureAn increase in our debt leverage could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.In April 2021, we entered into a new senior secured credit facility composed of a revolver credit facility and a term credit facility agreement (together, the “Credit Facilities”) (See Liquidity for details). At June 30, 2022, we had outstanding borrowings of $98.8 million and utilized $4.1 million of the letters of credit sublimit under the Credit Facilities, and had $12.9 million of availability under our Credit Facilities. We may incur significant indebtedness in the future, including through additional borrowings under the credit facility, through the issuance of debt securities, or otherwise.Our present indebtedness and any future borrowings could have adverse consequences, including:•requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness;•reducing the cash flow available or limiting our ability to borrow additional funds, to pay dividends, to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to pursue our business strategies;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate;•limiting our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all;•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.To the extent we become more leveraged, we face an increased likelihood that one or more of the risks described above would materialize.  The Credit Facilities contain certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and restrictions that, among other things, require the Company to satisfy certain financial covenants and restricts the Company's and its subsidiaries' ability to incur additional debt, pay dividends and make distributions, make certain investments and acquisitions, repurchase its stock and prepay certain indebtedness, create liens, enter into agreements with affiliates, modify the nature of its business, transfer and sell material assets and merge or consolidate. Non-compliance with one or more of the covenants and restrictions could result in the full or partial principal balance of the Credit Facilities becoming immediately due and payable and termination of the commitments. If we are unable to make payments as they come due or comply with the restrictions and covenants under the Credit Facilities or any other agreements governing our indebtedness, there could be a default under the terms of such agreements. In such event, or if we are otherwise in default under the Credit Facilities or any such other agreements, the lenders could terminate their commitments to lend and/or accelerate the loans and declare all amounts borrowed due and payable. If our liquidity materially declines, we may experience springing covenants and an increase in our cost of borrowing. Furthermore, our lenders under the Credit Facilities could foreclose on their security interests in our assets. If any of those events occur, our assets might not be sufficient to repay in full all of our outstanding indebtedness and we may be unable to find alternative financing on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to maintain existing or secure new financing could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial position.Our liquidity has been adversely affected as a result of our operating performance in recent periods and may be further materially adversely affected by constraints in the capital and credit markets and limitations under our financing arrangements.We need sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements, service our outstanding indebtedness and finance business opportunities. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail our operations, or we may not be able to pursue business opportunities. The principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities, available cash, our credit facility, and proceeds from the sale of assets. In recent periods, significant acquisition costs, large capital investments along with the underperformance of our business has resulted in a decrease in funds from operating activities, which has weakened our liquidity position. During fiscal years 2022 and 2021, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related federal, state, and local restrictive measures have had an adverse impact on certain of our customers, particularly restaurants, hotels, casinos and coffeehouses, which has materially impacted our liquidity.Should our operating performance deteriorate further or the COVID-19 pandemic recurs in the near term, we will have less cash inflows from operations available to meet our financial obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs. In addition, if such 15deterioration were to lead to the closure of leased facilities, we would need to fund the costs of terminating those leases. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future to satisfy these financial obligations, we may be required to, among other things:•seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;•refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness;•sell assets; and/or•reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures, strategic acquisitions or investments.Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to satisfy our financial obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, and could impede the implementation of our business strategy, prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business and/or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all. Our ability to obtain additional financing or refinance our indebtedness would depend upon, among other things, our financial condition at the time, and the liquidity of the overall capital markets and the state of the economy. Furthermore, any refinancing of our existing debt could be at higher interest rates and may require compliance with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, if our lenders experience difficulties that render them unable to fund future draws on the credit facility, we may not be able to access all or a portion of these funds, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and pursue our business strategies. In addition, covenants in our debt agreements could restrict or delay our ability to respond to business opportunities, or in the event of a failure to comply with such covenants, could result in an event of default, which if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on us.Rising inflation may adversely affect us by increasing costs of raw materials, labor, and other costs beyond what we can recover through price increases.Inflation can adversely affect us by increasing the costs of raw materials, labor, and other costs required to operate and grow our business. Many of the markets in which we sell our products are experiencing high levels of inflation, which may depress consumer demand for our products and reduce our profitability if we are unable to raise prices enough to keep up with increases in our costs. Inflationary pressures have resulted in increases in the cost of certain raw materials, and other supplies necessary for the production of our products, and such increases may continue to impact us in the future and expose us to risks associated with significant levels of cost inflation. If we are unable to increase our prices to offset the effects of inflation, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Our outstanding Series A Preferred Stock or future equity offerings could adversely affect the holders of our common stock in some circumstances.As of June 30, 2022, we had 14,700 shares of Series A Convertible Participating Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share (“Series A Preferred Stock”), outstanding. The Series A Preferred Stock could adversely affect the holders of our common stock in certain circumstances. On an as converted basis, holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote together with the holders of our common stock and are entitled to share in the dividends on common stock, when declared. The Series A Preferred Stock pays a dividend, when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors, of 3.5% APR of the stated value per share payable in four quarterly installments in arrears, and has an initial stated value of $1,000 per share, adjustable up or down by the amount of undeclared and unpaid dividends or subsequent payment of accumulated dividends thereon, respectively, and a conversion premium of 22.5%. We may, at our election and if certain conditions are met, mandate the conversion of all the Series A Preferred Stock. The holder, if certain conditions are met, may voluntarily convert. In the future, we may offer additional equity, equity-linked or debt securities, which may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. As a result, our common stockholders may experience dilution. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the holders of our common stock.                               Anti-takeover provisions or stockholder dilution could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us.Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares without any further vote or action by stockholders. We currently have 479,000 authorized shares of preferred stock undesignated as to series, and we could cause shares currently designated as to series but not outstanding to become undesignated and available for issuance as a series of preferred stock to be designated in the future. The rights of the holders of our common stock may be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of the Company without further action by stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.Further, certain provisions of our organizational documents, including a classified board of directors which will phase out following our annual meeting of stockholders in 2022, have provisions eliminating the ability of stockholders to take action by 16written consent, and provisions limiting the ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of stockholders without giving advance notice, may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of the Company, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, our organizational documents do not permit cumulative voting, which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our Board of Directors. Further, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which will prohibit us from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, even if such combination is favored by a majority of stockholders, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. The application of Section 203 also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or management.Volatility in the equity markets or interest rate fluctuations could substantially increase our pension funding requirements and negatively impact our financial position.As of June 30, 2022, the projected benefit obligation under our two employer defined benefit pension plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets. The difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets, or the funded status of the plans, significantly affects the net periodic benefit cost and ongoing funding requirements of those plans. Among other factors, changes in interest rates, mortality rates, early retirement rates, mix of plan asset investments, investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the level of plan funding, cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost, increase our future funding requirements and require payments to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. In addition, facility closings may trigger cash payments or previously unrecognized obligations under our defined benefit pension plans, and the cost of such liabilities may be significant or may compromise our ability to close facilities or otherwise conduct cost reduction initiatives on time and within budget. A significant increase in future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.Risks Related to Cybersecurity and Data PrivacyFailure to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain privacy and data protections laws and regulations may subject us to substantial negative financial consequences and civil or criminal penalties.Complex local, state, national, foreign and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal data. These privacy and data protection laws and regulations are quickly evolving, with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations and enforcement. In addition, our legal and regulatory obligations in jurisdictions outside the U.S. are subject to unexpected changes, including the potential for regulatory or other governmental entities to enact new or additional laws or regulations, to issue rulings that invalidate prior laws or regulations or to increase penalties significantly. Complying with these laws and regulations can be costly and can impede the development and offering of new products and services.Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations to which we may be subject relating to personal data, or to protect personal data from unauthorized access, use or other processing, could result in enforcement actions and regulatory investigations against us, claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals, fines, damage to our brand reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance and business.We rely on information technology and software in our operations. Any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could affect our ability to effectively operate our business.Our ability to effectively manage our business, maintain information accuracy and efficiency, comply with regulatory, financial reporting, legal and tax requirements, and coordinate the production, distribution and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability, capacity and integrity of information technology systems, software and networks. We are also dependent on enterprise resource planning software for some of our information technology systems and support. The failure of these systems to operate effectively and continuously for any reason could result in delays in processing replenishment orders from our branch warehouses, an inability to record input costs or product sales accurately or at all, an impaired understanding of our operations and results, an increase in operating expenses, reduced operational efficiency, loss of customers or other business disruptions, all of which could negatively affect our business and results of operations. To date, we have not experienced a material breach of cyber security, however our computer systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subjected to unauthorized access or phishing attempts, computer viruses, malware, ransomware or other malicious codes. While we have implemented training and information security policies for our team members and bolstered cybersecurity experience on our board, these measures may be insufficient to prevent against the constantly evolving threats. These threats increase the difficulty of timely detection and successful defense. As a result, security, backup, disaster recovery, administrative and technical controls, and incident response measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to prevent cyber-attacks or other security breaches to our systems. Failure to effectively allocate and manage our resources to build, sustain, protect and upgrade our information technology infrastructure could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of 17customers, reputational damage, litigation, business disruptions, or the loss of sensitive or confidential data through security breach or otherwise. Significant capital investments could be required to remediate any potential problems or to otherwise protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. In addition, if our customers or suppliers experience a security breach or system failure, their businesses could be disrupted or negatively affected, which may result in a reduction in customer orders or disruption in our supply chain, which would adversely affect our results of operations.Failure to prevent the unauthorized access, use, theft or destruction of personal, financial and other confidential information relating to our customers, suppliers, employees or our Company, could damage our business reputation, negatively affect our results of operations, and expose us to potential liability.The protection of our customer, supplier, employee, and Company data and confidential information is critical. We are subject to new and changing privacy and information security laws and standards that may require significant investments in technology and new operational processes. The use of electronic payment methods and collection of other personal information exposes us to increased risk of privacy and/or security breaches. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools, and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting, and storing personal information from individuals, including our customers, suppliers and employees, and our security measures may not effectively prohibit others from obtaining improper access to such information. We rely on third party, cloud based technologies which results in third party access and storage of Company data and confidential information. Employees or third parties with whom we do business or to whom we outsource certain information technology or administrative services may attempt to circumvent security measures in order to misappropriate such information, and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. If we experience a data security breach of any kind or fail to respond appropriately to such incidents, we may experience a loss of or damage to critical data, suffer financial or reputational damage or penalties, or face exposure to negative publicity, government investigations and proceedings, private consumer or securities litigation, liability or costly response measures. In addition, our reputation within the business community and with our customers and suppliers may be affected, which could result in our customers and suppliers ceasing to do business with us which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our insurance policies do not cover losses caused by security breaches"
3,FARM,FARMER BROS CO,2021-09-10,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
You should carefully consider each of the following factors, as well as the other information in this report, in evaluating our business and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also negatively affect our business operations, reputation, financial condition, results of operations or the trading price of our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline.Risks Related to our Business and IndustryA resurgence of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) and appearances of new variants of the virus could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.In fiscal years 2020 and 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic had a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The measures taken to contain the spread of the virus adversely affected our business and those of our customers. The outbreak resulted in federal, state and local government authorities implementing numerous restrictive measures to attempt to contain COVID-19, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and shutdowns. These measures impacted our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, and those of our respective vendors and suppliers. A substantial portion of the restrictions have eased in many places.  However, resurgences of COVID-19 or new variants of the virus may result in the reinstitution of certain of the restrictions and increased economic uncertainty, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  Our success will depend on our ability and effectiveness in identifying and addressing our customers’ future needs in light of the development of COVID-19, its variants and responsive measures.  Although we have already experienced some negative effects of COVID-19, it is difficult to predict the extent and timing of the impact that a resurgence could have on our customer base.The degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic or the appearance of new variants may impact our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of any outbreak, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume and our effectiveness on serving our customer base and acquiring new customers.  With the uncertainty around the duration and breadth of COVID-19 and the resurgence of its variants, the ultimate impact on our business, financial condition or operating results cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.We depend on the expertise of key personnel to operate our business. The unexpected loss of one or more of these key employees or difficulty recruiting and retaining qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations and competitive position.Our success depends on the efforts and abilities of key personnel and a consistent workforce, including frontline workers, support staff and executive team members.  The competition for talent is extremely high and candidates’ preferences and expectations are evolving.  We must continue to recruit, retain, motivate and develop management and other employees sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth and strategic initiatives. This may require us to adapt to evolving labor conditions and make significant investments in training, coaching and other career development and retention activities. Activities related to identifying, recruiting, hiring and integrating qualified individuals require significant time and attention. In this competitive environment, our business could be adversely impacted by increases in labor costs, including wages and benefits, including those increases triggered by regulatory actions regarding wages, scheduling and benefits; increased health care and workers’ compensation insurance costs; increased wages and costs of other benefits necessary to attract and retain high quality employees with the right skill sets and increased wages, benefits and costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its resurgence. In addition, our wages and benefits programs, combined with the challenging conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, may be insufficient to attract and retain the talent, particularly in areas with extended COVID-19 unemployment benefits where additional incentives to work may be required.11We may also need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract talented new employees and to invest in our employee experience and culture, and we may never realize returns on these investments.  We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our executive officers.  If we are not able to effectively retain our talent, our ability to achieve certain strategic objectives may be adversely affected, which may impact our financial condition and results of operations. Further, any unplanned turnover or failure to develop or implement an adequate succession plan for our senior management and other key employees, could deplete our institutional knowledge base, erode our competitive advantage, and negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Competition in the coffee industry and beverage category could impact our profitability or harm our competitive position.The coffee industry is highly competitive, including with respect to price, product quality, service, convenience, technology and innovation, and competition could become increasingly more intense due to the relatively low barriers to entry and industry consolidation. We face competition from many sources, including the institutional foodservice divisions of multi-national manufacturers of retail products, wholesale foodservice distributors, regional and national coffee roasters, specialty coffee suppliers, and retail brand beverage manufacturers, many of which have greater financial and other resources than we do and may have lower fixed costs and/or are substantially less leveraged than our company. As many of our customers are small foodservice operators, we also compete with cash and carry and club stores and on-line retailers. Companies smaller than ours may be more innovative, better able to bring new products to market and better able to quickly exploit and serve niche markets.We consider our roasting and blending methods essential to the flavor and richness of our coffees and, therefore, essential to our brand. Because our roasting methods cannot be patented, we would be unable to prevent competitors from copying these methods if such methods became known. In addition, competitors may be able to develop roasting or blending methods that are more advanced than our production methods, which may also harm our competitive position.Increased competition in coffee or other beverage channels may have an adverse impact on sales of our products. If we do not succeed in differentiating ourselves through, among other things, our product and service offerings, or if we are not effective in setting proper pricing, then our competitive position may be weakened, we could fail to retain our existing customer base and our sales and profitability may be materially adversely affected.Increases in the cost of green coffee could reduce our gross margin and profit and may increase volatility in our results.Our primary raw material is green coffee, an exchange-traded agricultural commodity that is subject to price fluctuations. Our ability to acquire a consistent supply of green coffee sufficient to meet our needs, similar to any agricultural commodity, may be impacted by, among other things, climate change, weather, natural disasters, real or perceived supply shortages, crop disease (such as coffee rust) and pests, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, an increase in green coffee purchased and sold on a negotiated basis rather than directly on commodity markets in response to higher production costs relative to “C” market prices, political and economic conditions or uncertainty, labor actions, foreign currency fluctuations, armed conflict in coffee producing nations, acts of terrorism, pandemics or other disease outbreaks (including the COVID-19 pandemic), government actions and trade barriers or tariffs, and the actions of producer organizations that have historically attempted to influence green coffee prices through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. Speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices. Additionally, specialty green coffees tend to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “C” market price which premium, depending on the supply and demand at the time of purchase, may be significant.  We purchase over-the-counter coffee-related derivative instruments to enable us to lock in the price of green coffee commodity purchases on our behalf or at the direction of our customers under commodity-based pricing arrangements. Although we account for certain coffee-related derivative instruments as accounting hedges, the portion of open hedging contracts that are not designated as accounting hedges are marked to period-end market price and unrealized gains or losses based on whether the period-end market price was higher or lower than the price we locked-in are recognized in our financial results at the end of each reporting period. Depending on contractual restrictions, we may be unable to pass these costs to our customers by increasing the price of products. If we are unable to increase prices sufficiently to offset increased input costs, or if our sales volume decreases significantly as a result of price increases, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.12Recently, there has been increased volatility in the “C” market price, with prices at times increasing to five-year highs. The uncertainty over several factors, including the impact of weather patterns in coffee producing regions, global supply chain constraints and shipping shortages, and speculative trading, has caused greater uncertainty in the markets. Specifically, severe frosts and drought in Brazil currently threaten to negatively impact crop yields for multiple harvests, which could reduce supply and increase cost. Although we hedge the ""C"" market price volatility for a portion of our green coffee volumes by using derivative instruments, our hedging strategy and use of these instruments does not completely mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk. As a result, increases in the cost of green coffee could have a material adverse impact on our profitability, financial condition or results of operations. Loss of business from one or more of our large national account customers and efforts by these customers to improve their profitability could have a material adverse effect on our operations.We have a number of large national account customers, the loss of or reduction in sales to one or more of which would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  During fiscal 2021, our top five customers accounted for approximately 23.6% of our net sales. We generally do not have long-term contracts with the majority of our customers. Accordingly, the majority of our customers can stop purchasing our products at any time without penalty and are free to purchase products from our competitors. There can be no assurance that our customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as they have in the past. In addition, because of the competitive environment facing many of our customers and industry consolidation which has produced large customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength, our customers have increasingly sought to improve their profitability through pricing concessions and more favorable trade terms. To the extent we provide pricing concessions or favorable trade terms, our margins would be reduced. If we are unable to continue to offer terms that are acceptable to our customers, they may reduce purchases of our products which would adversely affect our financial performance. Requirements that may be imposed on us by our customers, such as sustainability, inventory management or product specification requirements, may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, our customers may face financial difficulties, bankruptcy or other business disruptions that may impact their operations and their purchases from us and may affect their ability to pay us for products which could adversely affect our sales and profitability.Our accounts receivable represents a significant portion of our current assets and a substantial portion of our trade accounts receivables relate principally to a limited number of customers, increasing our exposure to bad debts and counter-party risk which could potentially have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.A significant portion of our trade accounts receivable are from five customers, which represents approximately 31% of our trade accounts receivable at June 30, 2021. The concentration of our accounts receivable across a limited number of parties subjects us to individual counter-party and credit risk as these parties may breach our agreement, claim that we have breached the agreement, become insolvent and/or declare bankruptcy, delaying or reducing our collection of receivables or rendering collection impossible altogether. Certain of the parties use third-party distributors or do business through a network of affiliate entities which can make collection efforts more challenging and, at times, collections may be economically unfeasible. Adverse changes in general economic conditions and/or contraction in global credit markets could precipitate liquidity problems among our debtors. This could increase our exposure to losses from bad debts and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Climate change or water scarcity could have a material adverse effect our business and operations.Increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse effect on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters. In the event that climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity in the regions from which we procure coffee, we could be subject to decreased availability and increased prices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.  Water is used throughout the production of coffee from growing and pulping at the farm, cooling the beans after roasting in production and brewing products for consumption.  Scarcity of appropriate and sufficient water sources in our supply chain could limit supply and increase our costs. Loss of readily available access to water could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.13Increased severe weather patterns, including those resulting from climate change, may increase commodity costs, damage our facilities and disrupt our production capabilities and supply chain.There is increasing concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have caused and will continue to cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events. Major weather phenomena are dramatically affecting coffee growing countries. The wet and dry seasons are becoming unpredictable in timing and duration, causing improper development of the coffee cherries. Decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions as a result of changing weather patterns may affect the quality, limit the availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities, which are important ingredients for our products. We have experienced storm-related damages and disruptions to our operations in the recent past related to both winter storms as well as heavy rainfall and flooding. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could damage our facilities, impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations.Investment in acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, not result in the anticipated benefits and present risks not originally contemplated.We have invested, and in the future may invest, in acquisitions which may involve significant risks and uncertainties. The success of any such acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to realize all or some of the anticipated benefits from integrating the acquired businesses with our existing businesses, and to achieve revenue and cost synergies. Additionally, any such acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of additional debt, restructuring charges, impairment charges, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses related to intangible assets, and increased operating expenses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  There can be no assurance that any such acquisitions will be identified or that we will be able to consummate any such acquisitions on terms favorable to us or at all, or that the synergies from any such acquisitions will be achieved. If any such acquisitions are not successful, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.Our operating results may have significant fluctuations from period to period which could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.Our operating results may fluctuate from period to period as a result of a number of factors, including variations in our operating performance or the performance of our competitors, changes in accounting principles, fluctuations in the price and supply of green coffee, fluctuations in the selling prices of our products, the success of our hedging strategy, research reports and changes in financial estimates by analysts about us, or competitors or our industry, our inability or the inability of our competitors to meet analysts’ projections or guidance, strategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, capital investments or changes in business strategy, the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock, adverse outcomes of litigation, changes in or uncertainty about economic conditions, conditions or trends in our industry, geographies, or customers, activism by any large stockholder or group of stockholders, speculation by the investment community regarding our business, actual or anticipated growth rates relative to our competitors, terrorist acts, natural disasters, perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives, competition, changes in consumer preferences and market trends, seasonality, our ability to retain and attract customers, our ability to manage inventory and fulfillment operations and maintain gross margin, and other factors described elsewhere in this risk factors section. Fluctuations in our operating results due to these factors or for any other reason could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition, the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market price of equity securities issued by many companies. In the past, some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to class action or derivative lawsuits. The filing of a lawsuit against us, regardless of the outcome, could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as it could result in substantial legal costs, a diversion of management’s attention and resources, and require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments or to settle litigation. Accordingly, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful, and such comparisons should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance.14We face exposure to other commodity cost fluctuations, which could impact our margins and profitability.In addition to green coffee, we are exposed to cost fluctuations in other commodities under supply arrangements, including raw materials, tea, spices, and packaging materials such as carton board, corrugate and plastic. We are also exposed to fluctuations in the cost of fuel. We purchase certain ingredients, finished goods and packaging materials under cost-plus supply arrangements whereby our costs may increase based on an increase in the underlying commodity price or changes in production costs. The cost of these commodities, raw materials and fuel depend on various factors beyond our control, including economic and political conditions, foreign currency fluctuations, weather conditions, natural disasters (including floods, droughts, frosts, earthquakes and hurricanes) and changing global climate patterns. The changes in the prices we pay may take place on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis depending on the product and supplier. Unlike green coffee, we do not purchase any derivative instruments to hedge cost fluctuations in these other commodities. As a result, to the extent we are unable to pass along such costs to our customers through price increases, our margins and profitability will decrease.Our efforts to secure an adequate supply of quality coffees and other raw materials may be unsuccessful and impact our ability to supply our customers or expose us to commodity price risk.Maintaining a steady supply of green coffee is essential to keeping inventory levels low while securing sufficient stock to meet customer needs. We rely upon our ongoing relationships with our key suppliers to support our operations. Some of the Arabica coffee beans we purchase do not trade directly on the commodity markets. Rather, we purchase these coffee beans on a negotiated basis from coffee brokers, exporters and growers. If any of these supply relationships deteriorate or we are unable to renegotiate contracts with suppliers (with similar or more favorable terms) or find alternative sources for supply, we may be unable to procure a sufficient quantity of high-quality coffee beans and other raw materials at prices acceptable to us or at all which could negatively affect our results of operations. Further, non-performance by suppliers could expose us to supply risk under coffee purchase commitments for delivery in the future. In addition, the political situation in many of the Arabica coffee growing regions, including Africa, Indonesia, and Central and South America, can be unstable, and such instability could affect our ability to purchase coffee from those regions. If green coffee beans from a region become unavailable or prohibitively expensive, we could be forced to use alternative coffee beans or discontinue certain blends, which could adversely impact our sales.  Any material interruption in our supply chain, such as material interruption of roasted coffee supply due to the casualty loss at any of our roasting plants or suppliers, interruptions in service by our third-party logistic service providers or common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels, trade restrictions, such as increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes or customs restrictions, pandemics, social or labor unrest, natural disasters or political disputes and military conflicts that cause a material disruption in our supply chain could have a negative impact on our business and our profitability.   Product shortages could result in disruptions in our ability to deliver products to our customers, a deterioration of our relationship with our customers, decreased revenues or an inability to expand our business.  Interruption or increased costs of our supply chain and sales network or labor force, including a disruption in operations at any of our production and distribution facilities, could affect our ability to manufacture or distribute products and could adversely affect our business and sales.Our sales and distribution network requires a large investment to maintain and operate, and we rely on a limited number of production and distribution facilities.  We also operate a large fleet of trucks and other vehicles to distribute and deliver our products through our DSD network, and we rely on 3PL service providers for our long-haul distribution. Certain products are also distributed by third parties or direct shipped via common carrier. Many of these costs are beyond our control, and many are fixed rather than variable.There are potential adverse effects of labor disputes with our own employees or by others who provide warehousing, transportation (lines, truck drivers, 3PL service providers) or cargo handling (longshoremen), both domestic and foreign, of our raw materials or other products. We have union contracts relating to a portion of our workforce. Although we believe union relations have been amicable in the past, there is no assurance that this will continue in the future or that we will not be subject to future union organizing activity. The terms and conditions of existing, renegotiated or new collective bargaining agreements could also increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency or to adapt to changing business needs or strategy.15In addition, we use a significant amount of electricity, gasoline, diesel and oil, natural gas and other energy sources to operate our production and distribution facilities. An increase in the price, disruption of supply or shortage of fuel and other energy sources that may be caused by increased demand or by events such as climate change, natural disasters, power outages, cyberattacks or the like, could lead to higher electricity, transportation and other commodity costs, including the pass-through of such costs under our agreements with 3PL service providers and other suppliers, that could negatively impact our profitability, financial condition or results of operations.A disruption in operations at any of these facilities or any other disruption in our supply chain or increase in prices relating to service by our 3PL service providers, common carriers or distributors, service technicians or vendor-managed inventory arrangements, or otherwise, whether as a result of casualty, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorism, labor shortages, shipping costs, trade restrictions, contractual disputes, weather, environmental incident, interruptions in port operations or highway arteries, increased downtime due to certain aging production infrastructure, pandemic, strikes, work stoppages, the financial or operational instability of key suppliers, distributors and transportation providers, or other causes, could significantly impair our ability to operate our business, adversely affect our relationship with our customers, and impact our financial condition or results of operations. If our vendors fail to meet our standards, provide products in a timely and efficient manner, or comply with applicable laws, these issues could have a material negative impact on our business and profitability.We rely on co-packers to provide our supply of tea, spice, culinary and other products. Any failure by co-packers to fulfill their obligations or any termination or renegotiation of our co-pack agreements could adversely affect our results of operations.We have a number of supply agreements with co-packers that require them to provide us with specific finished goods, including tea, spice and culinary products. For some of our products we essentially rely upon a single co-packer as our sole-source for the product. The failure for any reason of any such sole-source or other co-packer to fulfill its obligations under the applicable agreements with us, including the failure by our co-packers to comply with food safety, environmental, or other laws and regulations, or the termination or renegotiation of any such co-pack agreement could result in disruptions to our supply of finished goods, cause damage to our reputation and brands, and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, our co-packers are subject to risk, including labor disputes, union organizing activities, financial liquidity, inclement weather, natural disasters, pandemics, supply constraints, and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable products, which could disrupt our supply of finished goods, or require that we incur additional expense by providing financial accommodations to the co-packer or taking other steps to seek to minimize or avoid supply disruption, such as establishing a new co-pack arrangement with another provider. A new co-pack arrangement may not be available on terms as favorable to us as our existing co-pack arrangements, or at all.Customer quality control problems or food safety issues may adversely affect our brands thereby negatively impacting our sales or leading to potential product recalls or product liability claims.Selling products for human consumption involves inherent legal risks. Our success depends on our ability to provide customers with high-quality products and service.  Although we take measures to ensure that we sell only fresh products, we have no control over our products once they are purchased by our customers. Clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee, tea and other beverages. We have no ability to ensure that our customers use a clean water supply to prepare these beverages.  Instances or reports of food safety issues involving our products, whether or not accurate, such as unclean water supply, food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, contamination, mislabeling, or other food or beverage safety issues, including due to the failure of our third-party co-packers to maintain the quality of our products and to comply with our product specifications, could damage the value of our brands, negatively impact sales of our products, and potentially lead to product recalls, production interruptions, product liability claims, litigation or damages.  A significant product liability claim against us, whether or not successful, or a widespread product recall may reduce our sales and harm our business.Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable net income may be subject to certain limitations.At June 30, 2021, the Company had approximately $178.1 million in federal and $139.7 million in state net operating loss carryforwards that will begin to expire in the years ending June 30, 2030 and June 30, 2022, respectively.  Net operating losses of $44.0 million in federal and $5.0 million of state are indefinite lived and will not expire. If an ownership change as 16defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the ""Code""), occurs with respect to our capital stock, our ability to use NOLs to offset taxable income would be subject to certain limitations. Generally, an ownership change occurs under Section 382 of the Code if certain persons or groups increase their aggregate ownership by more than 50 percentage points of our total capital stock over a rolling three-year period. If an ownership change occurs, our ability to use NOLs to reduce taxable net income is generally limited to an annual amount based on the fair market value of our stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt interest rate. If an ownership change were to occur, use of our NOLs to reduce payments of federal taxable net income may be deferred to later years within the 20-year carryover period; however, if the carryover period for any loss year expires, the use of the remaining NOLs for the loss year will be prohibited. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire, decrease in value or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. As a result, we may be unable to realize a tax benefit from the use of our NOLs, even if we generate a sufficient level of taxable net income prior to the expiration of the NOL carry forward periods.Future impairment charges could adversely affect our operating results.At June 30, 2021, we had $18.3 million in long-lived intangible assets, including recipes, non-compete agreements, customer relationships, trade names, trademarks and a brand name, associated with completed acquisitions. Acquisitions are based on certain target analysis and due diligence procedures designed to achieve a desired return or strategic objective. These procedures often involve certain assumptions and judgment in determining the acquisition price. After consummation of an acquisition, unforeseen issues could arise that adversely affect anticipated returns or that are otherwise not recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price. Even after careful integration efforts, actual operating results may vary significantly from initial estimates. We perform an asset impairment analysis on an annual basis or whenever events occur that may indicate possible existence of impairment. Failure to achieve forecasted operating results, due to weakness in the economic environment or other factors, changes in market conditions, loss of or significant decline in sales to customers included in valuation of the intangible asset, changes in our imputed cost of capital, and declines in our market capitalization, among other things, could result in impairment of our intangible assets and goodwill and adversely affect our operating results. During the year ended June 30, 2020, we recognized a full goodwill impairment and partial impairment of long-lived intangible assets. There were no intangible asset impairments during the year ended June 30, 2021.Our business could be negatively impacted by corporate citizenship and sustainability matters.There is an increased focus from certain investors, customers, consumers, employees, and other stakeholders concerning corporate citizenship and sustainability matters. From time to time, we announce certain initiatives regarding our focus areas, which include environmental matters, sustainability in our supply chain, responsible sourcing, social investments and inclusion and diversity. We could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such initiatives or goals, or we could fail in accurately reporting our progress on such initiatives and goals. Such failures could be due to changes in our business (e.g., shifts in business among distribution channels or acquisitions). Moreover, the standards by which citizenship and sustainability efforts and related matters are measured are developing and evolving, and certain areas are subject to assumptions. The standards or assumptions could change over time. Any such matters, or related corporate citizenship and sustainability matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business.Risks Related to Governance, Regulatory, Legislative and Legal MattersGovernment regulations affecting the conduct of our business could increase our operating costs, reduce demand for our products or result in litigation.The conduct of our business is subject to various laws and regulations including those relating to food safety, ingredients, manufacturing, processing, packaging, storage, marketing, advertising, labeling, quality and distribution of our products, import of raw materials, as well as environmental laws and those relating to privacy, worker health and workplace safety. These laws and regulations and interpretations thereof are subject to change as a result of political, economic or social events. In addition, our product advertising could make us the target of claims relating to false or deceptive advertising under U.S. federal and state laws, including the consumer protection statutes of some states. Any new laws and 17regulations or changes in government policy, existing laws and regulations or the interpretations thereof could require us to change certain of our operational processes and procedures, or implement new ones, and may increase our operating and compliance costs, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, modifications to international trade policy, or the imposition of increased or new tariffs, quotas or trade barriers on key commodities, could adversely impact our business and results of operations. In some cases, increased regulatory scrutiny could interrupt distribution of our products or force changes in our production processes or procedures (or force us to implement new processes or procedures). In addition, compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws, including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, could require us to reduce emissions and to incur compliance costs which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products. If we or our business partners fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to litigation, civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties, increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and adversely affect our reputation and brand image. In addition, claims or liabilities of this sort may not be covered by insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have against others.We could face significant withdrawal liability if we withdraw from participation in the multiemployer pension plans in which we participate.We participate in two multiemployer defined benefit pension plans and nine multiemployer defined contribution plans other than pension plans for certain union employees. We make periodic contributions to these plans to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants. Our required contributions to these plans could increase due to a number of factors, including the funded status of the plans and the level of our ongoing participation in these plans. Our risk of such increased payments may be greater if any of the participating employers in these underfunded plans withdraws from the plan due to insolvency and we are not able to contribute an amount sufficient to fund the unfunded liabilities associated with its participants in the plan. In the event we withdraw from participation in one or more of these plans, we could be required to make an additional lump-sum contribution to the plan. Our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer pension plan would depend on the extent of the plan’s funding of vested benefits. The amount of any potential withdrawal liability could be material to our results of operations and cash flows.Litigation pending against us could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation.We are currently party to various legal and other proceedings, and additional claims may arise in the future. See Note 20, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K. Regardless of the merit of particular claims, litigation may be expensive, time-consuming, operationally disruptive and distracting to management, and could negatively affect our brand name and image and subject us to statutory penalties and costs of enforcement. We can provide no assurances as to the outcome of any litigation or the resolution of any other claims against us. An adverse outcome of any litigation or other claim could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.We are self-insured and our reserves may not be sufficient to cover future claims.We are self-insured for many risks up to varying deductible amounts. The premiums associated with our insurance continue to increase. General liability, fire, workers’ compensation, directors’ and officers’ liability, life, employee medical, dental and vision, and automobile risks present a large potential liability. While we accrue for this liability based on historical claims experience, future claims may exceed claims we have incurred in the past. Should a different number of claims occur compared to what was estimated or the cost of the claims increase beyond what was anticipated, reserves recorded may not be sufficient and the accruals may need to be adjusted accordingly in future periods. A successful claim against us that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of our reserves or available insurance limits could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We maintain finished goods product coverage in amounts we believe to be adequate. However, we cannot assure you that we will not incur claims or liabilities for which we are not insured or that exceed the amount of our insurance coverage.  Moreover, claims or liabilities of this sort might not be covered by our insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have against others. A product liability judgment against us or a product recall or the damage to 18our reputation resulting therefrom could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.Risks Related to our Capital StructureAn increase in our debt leverage could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.In April 2021, we entered into a new senior secured credit facility composed of a revolver credit facility and a term credit facility agreement (together, the “Credit Facilities”) (See Liquidity for details).  At June 30, 2021, we had outstanding borrowings of $91.0 million and utilized $4.3 million of the letters of credit sublimit under the Credit Facilities, and had $25.7 million of availability under our Credit Facilities. We may incur significant indebtedness in the future, including through additional borrowings under the credit facility, through the issuance of debt securities, or otherwise.Our present indebtedness and any future borrowings could have adverse consequences, including:•requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness;•reducing the cash flow available or limiting our ability to borrow additional funds, to pay dividends, to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to pursue our business strategies;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate;•limiting our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all;•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.To the extent we become more leveraged, we face an increased likelihood that one or more of the risks described above would materialize.  The Credit Facilities contain certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and restrictions that, among other things, require the Company to satisfy certain financial covenants and restricts the Company's and its subsidiaries' ability to incur additional debt, pay dividends and make distributions, make certain investments and acquisitions, repurchase its stock and prepay certain indebtedness, create liens, enter into agreements with affiliates, modify the nature of its business, transfer and sell material assets and merge or consolidate. Non-compliance with one or more of the covenants and restrictions could result in the full or partial principal balance of the revolver credit facility becoming immediately due and payable and termination of the commitments. If we are unable to make payments as they come due or comply with the restrictions and covenants under the revolver credit facility or any other agreements governing our indebtedness, there could be a default under the terms of such agreements. In such event, or if we are otherwise in default under the Credit Facilities or any such other agreements, the lenders could terminate their commitments to lend and/or accelerate the loans and declare all amounts borrowed due and payable. If our liquidity materially declines, we may experience springing covenants and an increase in our cost of borrowing. Furthermore, our lenders under the revolver credit facility could foreclose on their security interests in our assets. If any of those events occur, our assets might not be sufficient to repay in full all of our outstanding indebtedness and we may be unable to find alternative financing on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to maintain existing or secure new financing could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial position.Our liquidity has been adversely affected as a result of our operating performance in recent periods and may be further materially adversely affected by constraints in the capital and credit markets and limitations under our financing arrangements.We need sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements, service our outstanding indebtedness and finance business opportunities. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail our operations, or we may not be able to pursue business opportunities. The principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities, 19available cash, our credit facility, and proceeds from the sale of assets. In recent periods, significant acquisition costs, large capital investments along with the underperformance of our business has resulted in a decrease in funds from operating activities, which has weakened our liquidity position. Since March 2020, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related federal, state, and local restrictive measures have had an adverse impact on certain of our customers, particularly restaurants, hotels, casinos and coffeehouses, which has materially impacted our liquidity.Should our operating performance deteriorate further or the COVID-19 pandemic persists or recurs in the near term, we will have less cash inflows from operations available to meet our financial obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs. In addition, if such deterioration were to lead to the closure of leased facilities, we would need to fund the costs of terminating those leases. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future to satisfy these financial obligations, we may be required to, among other things:•seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;•refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness;•sell assets; and/or•reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures, strategic acquisitions or investments.Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to satisfy our financial obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, and could impede the implementation of our business strategy, prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business and/or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all. Our ability to obtain additional financing or refinance our indebtedness would depend upon, among other things, our financial condition at the time, and the liquidity of the overall capital markets and the state of the economy. Furthermore, any refinancing of our existing debt could be at higher interest rates and may require compliance with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, if our lenders experience difficulties that render them unable to fund future draws on the credit facility, we may not be able to access all or a portion of these funds, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and pursue our business strategies. In addition, covenants in our debt agreements could restrict or delay our ability to respond to business opportunities, or in the event of a failure to comply with such covenants, could result in an event of default, which if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on us.Our outstanding Series A Preferred Stock or future equity offerings could adversely affect the holders of our common stock in some circumstances.As of June 30, 2021, we had 14,700 shares of Series A Convertible Participating Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share (“Series A Preferred Stock”), outstanding. The Series A Preferred Stock could adversely affect the holders of our common stock in certain circumstances. On an as converted basis, holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote together with the holders of our common stock and are entitled to share in the dividends on common stock, when declared. The Series A Preferred Stock pays a dividend, when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors, of 3.5% APR of the stated value per share payable in four quarterly installments in arrears, and has an initial stated value of $1,000 per share, adjustable up or down by the amount of undeclared and unpaid dividends or subsequent payment of accumulated dividends thereon, respectively, and a conversion premium of 22.5%. We may, if certain conditions are met, mandatorily convert all of the Series A Preferred Stock. The holder may voluntarily convert. In the future, we may offer additional equity, equity-linked or debt securities, which may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock.  As a result, our common stockholders may experience dilution. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the holders of our common stock. Anti-takeover provisions or stockholder dilution could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us.Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares without any further vote or action by stockholders. We currently have 479,000 authorized shares of preferred stock undesignated as to series, and we could cause shares currently designated as to series but not outstanding to become undesignated and available for issuance as a series of preferred stock to be designated in the future. The rights of the holders of our common stock may be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of 20preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of the Company without further action by stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.Further, certain provisions of our organizational documents, including a classified board of directors which will phase out in 2022, have provisions eliminating the ability of stockholders to take action by written consent, and provisions limiting the ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of stockholders without giving advance notice, may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of the Company, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, our organizational documents do not permit cumulative voting, which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our Board of Directors. Further, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which will prohibit us from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, even if such combination is favored by a majority of stockholders, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. The application of Section 203 also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or management.Volatility in the equity markets or interest rate fluctuations could substantially increase our pension funding requirements and negatively impact our financial position.As of June 30, 2021, the projected benefit obligation under our two employer defined benefit pension plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets. The difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets, or the funded status of the plans, significantly affects the net periodic benefit cost and ongoing funding requirements of those plans. Among other factors, changes in interest rates, mortality rates, early retirement rates, mix of plan asset investments, investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the level of plan funding, cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost, increase our future funding requirements and require payments to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. In addition, facility closings may trigger cash payments or previously unrecognized obligations under our defined benefit pension plans, and the cost of such liabilities may be significant or may compromise our ability to close facilities or otherwise conduct cost reduction initiatives on time and within budget. A significant increase in future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.Risks Related to Cybersecurity and Data PrivacyWe rely on information technology and are dependent on software in our operations. Any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could affect our ability to effectively operate our business.Our ability to effectively manage our business, maintain information accuracy and efficiency, comply with regulatory, financial reporting, legal and tax requirements, and coordinate the production, distribution and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability, capacity and integrity of information technology systems, software and networks. We are also dependent on enterprise resource planning software for some of our information technology systems and support. The failure of these systems to operate effectively and continuously for any reason could result in delays in processing replenishment orders from our branch warehouses, an inability to record input costs or product sales accurately or at all, an impaired understanding of our operations and results, an increase in operating expenses, reduced operational efficiency, loss of customers or other business disruptions, all of which could negatively affect our business and results of operations. To date, we have not experienced a material breach of cyber security, however our computer systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subjected to unauthorized access or phishing attempts, computer viruses, malware, ransomware or other malicious codes.  While we have implemented training and information security policies for our team members and bolstered cybersecurity experience on our board, these measures may be insufficient to prevent against the constantly evolving threats. These threats increase the difficulty of timely detection and successful defense.  As a result, security, backup, disaster recovery, administrative and technical controls, and incident response measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to prevent cyber-attacks or other security breaches to our systems. Failure to effectively allocate and manage our resources to build, sustain, protect and upgrade our information technology infrastructure could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, reputational damage, litigation, business disruptions, or the loss of sensitive or confidential data through security breach or otherwise. Significant capital investments could be required to remediate any potential problems or to otherwise protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. In addition, if our customers or suppliers experience a security breach or system failure, their 21businesses could be disrupted or negatively affected, which may result in a reduction in customer orders or disruption in our supply chain, which would adversely affect our results of operations.Failure to prevent the unauthorized access, use, theft or destruction of personal, financial and other confidential information relating to our customers, suppliers, employees or our Company, could damage our business reputation, negatively affect our results of operations, and expose us to potential liability.The protection of our customer, supplier, employee, and Company data and confidential information is critical. We are subject to new and changing privacy and information security laws and standards that may require significant investments in technology and new operational processes. The use of electronic payment methods and collection of other personal information exposes us to increased risk of privacy and/or security breaches. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools, and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting, and storing personal information from individuals, including our customers, suppliers and employees, and our security measures may not effectively prohibit others from obtaining improper access to such information. We rely on third party, cloud based technologies which results in third party access and storage of Company data and confidential information. Employees or third parties with whom we do business or to whom we outsource certain information technology or administrative services may attempt to circumvent security measures in order to misappropriate such information, and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. If we experience a data security breach of any kind or fail to respond appropriately to such incidents, we may experience a loss of or damage to critical data, suffer financial or reputational damage or penalties, or face exposure to negative publicity, government investigations and proceedings, private consumer or securities litigation, liability or costly response measures. In addition, our reputation within the business community and with our customers and suppliers may be affected, which could result in our customers and suppliers ceasing to do business with us which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our insurance policies do not cover losses caused by security breaches.22"
