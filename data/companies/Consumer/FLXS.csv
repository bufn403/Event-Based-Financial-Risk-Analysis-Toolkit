 The Company is subject to a variety of risks.  You should carefully consider the risk factors detailed below in conjunction with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Should any of these risks materialize the Company’s business, financial condition, and future prospects could be negatively impacted.  There may be additional factors that are presently unknown to the Company or that the Company currently believes to be immaterial that could affect its business.  Risks related to our operations: Business information systems could be impacted by disruptions and security breaches. The Company employs information technology systems to support its global business. Security breaches and other disruptions to the Company’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with operations, compromise information belonging to the Company and its customers and suppliers and expose the Company to liability which could adversely impact the Company’s business and reputation. In the ordinary course of business, the Company relies on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. Additionally, the Company collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain areas of its businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls.  While security breaches and other disruptions to the Company’s information technology networks and infrastructure could happen, none have occurred to date that has had a material impact on the Company. Any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage to the Company’s reputation, which could adversely affect the Company’s business. In addition, in response to shifts in employee workplace preferences, we have allowed certain of our employees the option of a hybrid work schedule where they may choose to work partially from home. Although we continue to implement strong physical and cybersecurity measures to ensure that our business operations remain functional and to ensure uninterrupted service to our customers, our systems and our operations remain vulnerable to cyberattacks and other disruptions because a material portion of our employees work remotely either full or part-time, and we cannot be certain that our mitigation efforts will be effective.   5 Table of Contents  The implementation of a new business information system could disrupt the business. The Company continues to migrate business and financial processes from legacy ERP systems to SAP.  The Company takes great care in the planning and execution of these migrations, however, implementation issues related to the transition could arise and may result in the following: Disruption of the Company’s domestic and international supply chain;Inability to fill customer orders accurately and on a timely basis;Negative impact on financial results;Inability to fulfill federal, state and local tax filing requirements in a timely and accurate matter; andIncreased demands of management and associates to the detriment of other corporate initiatives.   The Company’s participation in a multi-employer pension plan may have exposures under those plans that could extend beyond what its obligations would be with respect to its employees. The Company participates in, and makes periodic contributions to, one multi-employer pension plan that covers union employees. Multi-employer pension plans are managed by trustee boards comprised of participating employer and labor union representatives, and the employers participating in a multi-employer pension plan are jointly responsible for maintaining the plan’s funding requirements. Based on the most recent information available to the Company, the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities of the multi-employer pension plan substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits. As a result of the Company’s participation, it could experience greater volatility in the overall pension funding obligations. The Company’s obligations may be impacted by the funded status of the plans, the plans’ investment performance, changes in the participant demographics, financial stability of contributing employers and changes in actuarial assumptions. See Note 12 Benefit and Retirement Plans of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. Future results may be affected by various legal proceedings and compliance risk, including those involving product liability, environmental, or other matters.   The Company faces the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event the use of any of its products results in personal injury or property damage. In the event any of the Company’s products prove to be defective, it may be required to recall or redesign such products. The Company is also subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment. The Company could incur substantial costs, including legal expenses, as a result of the noncompliance with, or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under, environmental laws. Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, these various legal proceedings and compliance matters could have a material impact on the business, operating results, and financial condition. See Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. We may experience impairment of our long-lived assets, which would decrease our earnings and net worth. At June 30, 2023, we had $38.7 million in property, plant and equipment and $68.3 million in right of use assets associated with leased facilities. These definite-lived assets are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The outcome of impairment testing could result in the write-down of all or a portion of the value of these assets. A write-down of our assets would, in turn, reduce our earnings and net worth. In particular, if capacity requirements do not necessitate the utilization of our leased Mexicali, Mexico facility and we are unsuccessful at subleasing the facility in the future the carrying amount of the right of use asset associated with that lease may not be recoverable.  A write-down of all or a portion of the value of the Mexicali right of use asset could have a material impact on our earnings in the period of impairment. At June 30, 2023 the Company does not believe any impairment indicators exist due to current and expected sublease tenants and plans for future operations but impairment assessment involves the use of considerable judgement and any change in future market or economic conditions could cause actual results to differ. The Company’s success depends on its ability to recruit and retain key employees and highly skilled workers in a competitive labor market. If the Company is not successful in recruiting and retaining key employees and highly skilled workers or experiences the unexpected loss of those employees, the operations may be negatively impacted. Additionally, we are and will continue to be dependent upon our senior management team and other key personnel. Losing the services of one or more key members of our management team or other key personnel could adversely affect our operations. Ongoing or future communicable diseases increase the risk that certain senior executive officers or a member of the board of directors could become ill, 6 Table of Contents causing them to be incapacitated or otherwise unable to perform their duties for an extended absence. This could negatively impact the efficiency and effectiveness of processes and internal controls throughout the Company and our ability to service customers. We may not be able to collect amounts owed to us. We grant payment terms between 10 and 60 days to customers, often without requiring collateral. Due to ongoing global supply chain issues and inflationary cost pressures, some customers have requested extended payment terms or informed us they will not pay amounts within agreed upon terms. Some of our customers have experienced, and may in the future experience, cash flow and credit-related issues. While we perform credit evaluations of our customers, those evaluations may not prevent uncollectible trade accounts receivable. Credit evaluations involve significant management diligence and judgment, especially in the current environment. Should more customers experience liquidity issues than we anticipate, if payment is not received on a timely basis, or if a customer declares bankruptcy or closes stores, we may have difficulty collecting amounts owed to us by these customers, which could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition, and liquidity. Risks related to our industry: The impact of COVID-19 or similar pandemics could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to operate, our ability to keep employees safe from the pandemic, our results of operations, and financial condition.  During the initial height of the COVID-19 pandemic, purchases of home furnishings were heavily impacted as they are largely deferable and heavily influenced by consumer sentiment. Public health organizations recommended, and many governments implemented, measures from time-to-time to slow and limit the transmission of the virus, including certain business shutdowns and shelter in place and social distancing requirements. Such preventive measures, or others we may voluntarily put in place, may have a material adverse effect on our business for an indefinite period of time, such as the potential shut down of certain locations, decreased employee availability, potential border closures, and disruptions to the businesses of our selling channel partners, and others. Our suppliers and customers also face these and other challenges, which have and could continue to lead to a disruption in our supply chain, raw material inflation or the inability to get the raw materials necessary to produce our products, increased shipping, and transportation costs, as well as decreased consumer spending and decreased demand for our products. A resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic or other public health emergency in the future could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate, our ability to keep employees safe from the pandemic, our results of operations, and financial condition. Continuing inflation and changes in foreign currency may impact our profitability. Cost inflation including significant increases in ocean container rates, raw materials prices, labor rates, and domestic transportation costs have and could continue to impact profitability.  Continued imbalances between supply and demand for these resources may continue to exert upward pressure on costs.   The Company purchases raw materials, component parts, and certain finished goods from foreign external suppliers.  Prices for these purchases are primarily negotiated in U.S. dollars on a purchase order basis.  A negative shift in the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency of our supplier could result in price increases and negatively impact our cost structure.  In addition, the majority of our manufactured products are produced in Mexico.  The wages of our employees and certain other employee benefit and indirect costs are made in Pesos.  The Company does not employ any foreign currency hedges against this exposure. A negative shift in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Peso could increase the cost of manufacturing. Our ability to recover these cost increases through price increases may continue to lag the cost increases, resulting in downward pressure on margins. In addition, price increases to offset rising costs could negatively impact demand for our products.  The Company’s products are considered deferrable purchases for consumers during economic downturns. Prolonged negative economic conditions could impact the business. Economic downturns and prolonged negative economic conditions could affect consumer spending habits by decreasing the overall demand for home furnishing products. These events could impact retailers resulting in an impact on the Company’s business. A recovery in the Company’s sales could lag significantly behind a general economic recovery due to the deferrable nature and relatively significant cost of purchasing home furnishing products. Future success depends on the Company’s ability to manage its global supply chain. The Company acquires raw materials, component parts, and certain finished products from external suppliers, both U.S. and foreign.  Many of these suppliers are dependent upon other suppliers in countries other than where they are located. This global interdependence 7 Table of Contents within the Company’s supply chain is subject to delays in delivery, availability, quality, and pricing. Changes in international trade policies including tariffs, access to ports and border crossings, or railways could disrupt the supply chain, increase cost and reduce competitiveness. The delivery of goods from these suppliers has been and may continue to be delayed by customs, labor issues, availability of third-party transportation and equipment, geo-political pressures, changes in political, economic, and social conditions, weather, laws, and regulations. Unfavorable fluctuations in price, international trade policies, quality, delivery, and availability of these products could continue to adversely affect the Company’s ability to meet demands of customers and cause negative impacts to the Company’s cost structure, profitability, and its cash flow. Enacted tariffs and potential future increases in tariffs on manufactured goods imported from China or other countries could adversely affect our business. Inability to reduce acquisition costs or pass-through price increases may have an adverse impact on sales volume, earnings, and liquidity.  Similarly, increases in pricing may have an adverse impact on the competitiveness of the Company’s products relative to other furniture manufacturers with less exposure to the tariff and could also lead to adverse impacts on volume, earnings, and liquidity.  Additionally, a disruption in supply from foreign countries could adversely affect our ability to timely fill customer orders for those products and decrease our sales, earnings, and liquidity. The main foreign countries we source from are Vietnam, China, Thailand, and Mexico. It is unclear how our supply chain could be further impacted by COVID-19, including the spread of new variants, and there are many unknowns including how long we could be impacted, the severity of the impacts, and the probability of a recurrence of COVID-19 or similar regional or global pandemics. If we were unsuccessful in obtaining those products from other sources or at comparable cost, a disruption in our supply chain could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition, and liquidity. Finally, the Company relies on third parties to deliver customer orders. The capacity of these third parties or cost of this service could be impacted by labor disputes, cost inflation (particularly fuel), and availability of drivers which could increase cost and have negative impacts on our earnings. Competition from U.S. and foreign finished product manufacturers may adversely affect the business, operating results or financial condition. The furniture industry is very competitive and fragmented. The Company competes with U.S. and foreign manufacturers and distributors. As a result, the Company may not be able to maintain or raise the prices of its products in response to competitive pressures or increasing costs. Also, due to the large number of competitors and their wide range of product offerings, the Company may not be able to significantly differentiate its products (through styling, finish, and other construction techniques) from those of its competitors. Additionally, most of our sales are to distribution channels that rely on physical stores to merchandise and sell our products and an involuntary shut down of those stores due to COVID-19 or similar pandemic or a significant shift in consumer preference toward purchasing products online could have a materially adverse impact on our sales and operating margin.  These and other competitive pressures could cause us to lose market share, revenues, and customers, increase expenditure or reduce prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or liquidity. Future costs of complying with various laws and regulations may adversely impact future operating results. The Company’s business is subject to various laws and regulations which could have a significant impact on operations and the cost to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely impact the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, inadvertently failing to comply with such laws and regulations could produce negative consequences which could adversely impact the Company’s operations. Failure to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer or designer tastes and fashions in a timely manner could adversely affect the Company’s business and decrease sales and earnings. Furniture is a styled product and is subject to rapidly changing consumer and end-user trends and tastes and is highly fashion oriented. If the Company is not able to acquire sufficient fabric variety or if the Company is unable to predict or respond to changes in fashion trends, it may lose sales and have to sell excess inventory at reduced prices. Use of social media to disseminate negative commentary may adversely impact the Company’s reputation and business. There has been a substantial increase in the use of social media platforms, including blogs, social media websites, and other forms of internet-based communications, which allow individuals to access a broad audience of consumers and other interested persions. Negative commentary regarding the Company or its products may be posted on social media platforms at any time and may have an adverse impact on its reputation, business, or relationships with third parties, including suppliers, customers, investors, and lendors. Consumers 8 Table of Contents value readily available information and often act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its accuracy or context. The harm may be immediate without affording the Company an opportunity for redress or correction"

Additionally, we are and will continue to be dependent upon our senior management team and other key personnel. Losing the services of one or more key members of our management team or other key personnel could adversely affect our operations. In addition, the ongoing impact of COVID-19, or risk of similar communicable disease in the future, increases the risk that certain senior executive officers or a member of the board of directors could become ill, causing them to be incapacitated or otherwise unable to perform their duties for an extended absence. Furthermore, because of the nature of the disease, multiple people working in close proximity could also become ill simultaneously which could result in the same department having extended absences or a temporary shutdown of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers. This could negatively impact the efficiency and effectiveness of processes and internal controls throughout the Company and our ability to service customers. Terms of collective bargaining agreements and labor disruptions could adversely impact results of operations. Terms of collective bargaining agreements that prevent the Company from competing effectively could adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  The Company is committed to working with those groups to avert or resolve conflicts as they arise.  However, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. 6 Table of Contents  We may not be able to collect amounts owed to us. We grant 30-day payment terms to most customers. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain issues and inflationary cost pressures, some customers have requested extended payment terms or informed us they will not pay amounts within agreed upon terms. Some of our customers have experienced, and may in the future experience, cash flow and credit-related issues. If the negative economic effects of COVID-19 were to persist or a similar pandemic or another major, unexpected event with negative economic effects were to occur, we may not be able to collect amounts owed to us or such payment may only occur after significant delay. While we perform credit evaluations of our customers, those evaluations may not prevent uncollectible trade accounts receivable. Credit evaluations involve significant management diligence and judgment, especially in the current environment. Should more customers experience liquidity issues than we anticipate, if payment is not received on a timely basis, or if a customer declares bankruptcy or closes stores, we may have difficulty collecting amounts owed to us by these customers, which could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition, and liquidity. Risks related to our industry: The COVID-19 pandemic could continue to have a materially adverse effect on our ability to operate, our ability to keep employees safe from the pandemic, our results of operations, and financial condition.  On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the current coronavirus (“COVID-19”) outbreak to be a global pandemic, and the virus continues to spread in areas where we operate and sell our products. The COVID-19 pandemic and similar issues in the future could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate, our ability to keep employees safe from the pandemic, our results of operations, and financial condition. Public health organizations have recommended, and many governments have implemented, measures from time-to-time during the pandemic to slow and limit the transmission of the virus, including certain business shutdowns and shelter in place and social distancing requirements. Such preventive measures, or others we may voluntarily put in place, may have a material adverse effect on our business for an indefinite period of time, such as the potential shut down of certain locations, decreased employee availability, potential border closures, and disruptions to the businesses of our selling channel partners, and others. Our suppliers and customers also face these and other challenges, which have and could continue to lead to a disruption in our supply chain, raw material inflation or the inability to get the raw materials necessary to produce our products, increased shipping, and transportation costs, as well as decreased consumer spending and decreased demand for our products.  Although these disruptions may continue to occur, the long-term economic impact and near-term financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including but not limited to, potential near-term or long-term risk of asset impairment, restructuring, and other charges, cannot be reliably quantified or estimated at this time due to the uncertainty of future developments. Continuing inflation may impact our profitability. Cost inflation including significant increases in ocean container rates, raw materials prices, labor rates, and domestic transportation costs have and could continue to impact profitability.  Continued imbalances between supply and demand for these resources may continue to exert upward pressure on costs.  Our ability to recover these cost increases through price increases may continue to lag the cost increases, resulting in downward pressure on margins. In addition, price increases to offset rising costs could negatively impact demand for our products.  The Company’s products are considered deferrable purchases for consumers during economic downturns. Prolonged negative economic conditions could impact the business. Economic downturns and prolonged negative economic conditions could affect consumer spending habits by decreasing the overall demand for home furnishing products. These events could impact retailers resulting in an impact on the Company’s business. A recovery in the Company’s sales could lag significantly behind a general economic recovery due to the deferrable nature and relatively significant cost of purchasing home furnishing products. Future success depends on the Company’s ability to manage its global supply chain. The Company acquires raw materials, component parts and certain finished products from external suppliers, both U.S. and foreign.  Many of these suppliers are dependent upon other suppliers in countries other than where they are located. This global interdependence within the Company’s supply chain is subject to delays in delivery, availability, quality, and pricing. Changes in international trade policies including tariffs could disrupt the supply chain, increase cost and reduce competitiveness. The delivery of goods from these suppliers has been and may continue to be delayed by customs, labor issues, geo-political pressures, disruptions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in political, economic, and social conditions, weather, laws and regulations. Unfavorable fluctuations in 7 Table of Contents price, international trade policies, quality, delivery, and availability of these products could continue to adversely affect the Company’s ability to meet demands of customers and cause negative impacts to the Company’s cost structure, profitability and its cash flow. Enacted tariffs and potential future increases in tariffs on manufactured goods imported from China or other countries could adversely affect our business. The tariff on certain manufactured furniture products imported from China on or after June 1, 2019, is currently 25%. Given ongoing uncertainty in relations, including trade negotiations between the United States and China, it is unclear as to whether the U.S. administration will take further tariff action or perhaps grant relief to actions already put in place.  Inability to reduce acquisition costs or pass-through price increases may have an adverse impact on sales volume, earnings, and liquidity.  Similarly, increases in pricing may have an adverse impact on the competitiveness of the Company’s products relative to other furniture manufacturers with less exposure to the tariff and could also lead to adverse impacts on volume, earnings, and liquidity.  Additionally, a disruption in supply from foreign countries could adversely affect our ability to timely fill customer orders for those products and decrease our sales, earnings, and liquidity. The main foreign countries we source from are Vietnam, China, Thailand, and Mexico. In early 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak in China resulted in the temporary shutdown or reduced capacity of our vendors’ factories. Consequently, we experienced some out-of-stocks, but in some cases, we were able to provide substitutions out of inventory on hand, in-transit, and from our domestic warehouses, but not enough to entirely mitigate the lost sales. Many of our vendors’ factories are back online, however, the COVID-19 outbreak caused travel restrictions due to government regulations. The travel restrictions have caused labor shortages for our Vietnam suppliers due to limited access to workers from other surrounding countries. Consequently, we may experience shortages of certain products. Our ability to transport products from foreign countries is also dependent on the availability and cost of ocean containers, both of which were materially and adversely impacted by COVID-19. It is unclear how our supply chain could be further impacted by COVID-19, including the spread of new variants, and there are many unknowns including how long we will be impacted, the severity of the impacts, and the probability of a recurrence of COVID-19 or similar regional or global pandemics. If we were unsuccessful in obtaining those products from other sources or at comparable cost, a disruption in our supply chain could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition, and liquidity.

Additionally, most of our sales are to distribution channels that rely on physical stores to merchandise and sell our products and a significant shift in consumer preference toward purchasing products online could have a materially adverse impact on our sales and operating margin. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated and may continue to increase the shift to online furniture purchases by changing customer shopping patterns and behaviors, including decreased consumer willingness to visit physical retail locations. These and other competitive pressures could cause us to lose market share, revenues, and customers, increase expenditures or reduce prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or liquidity. Future costs of complying with various laws and regulations may adversely impact future operating results. The Company’s business is subject to various laws and regulations which could have a significant impact on operations and the cost to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely impact the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, inadvertently failing to comply with such laws and regulations could produce negative consequences which could adversely impact the Company’s operations.

 The Company is subject to a variety of risks.  You should carefully consider the risk factors detailed below in conjunction with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Should any of these risks materialize the Company’s business, financial condition, and future prospects could be negatively impacted.  There may be additional factors that are presently unknown to the Company or that the Company currently believes to be immaterial that could affect its business.  Risks related to our operations: Business information systems could be impacted by disruptions and security breaches. The Company employs information technology systems to support its global business. Security breaches and other disruptions to the Company’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with operations, compromise information belonging to the Company and its customers and suppliers and expose the Company to liability which could adversely impact the Company’s business and reputation. In the ordinary course of business, the Company relies on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. Additionally, the Company collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain areas of its businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls.  While security breaches and other disruptions to the Company’s information technology networks and infrastructure could happen, none have occurred to date that have had a material impact to the Company. Any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage to the Company’s reputation, which could adversely affect the Company’s business. In addition, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have allowed certain of our employees the option to work from home. Although we continue to implement strong physical and cybersecurity measures to ensure that our business operations remain functional and to ensure uninterrupted service to our customers, our systems and our operations remain vulnerable to cyberattacks and other disruptions because a material portion of our employees work remotely as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and we cannot be certain that our mitigation efforts will be effective.  5 Table of Contents   The implementation of a new business information system could disrupt the business. The Company converted certain financial modules from its legacy ERP system to SAP during fiscal 2021, and it plans to convert additional modules in fiscal 2022, which include ordering, sourcing, warehousing and transportation. Implementation issues related to the new ERP system could arise and may result in the following: Disruption of the Company’s domestic and international supply chain;Inability to fill customer orders accurately and on a timely basis;Inability to process payments to suppliers and vendors;Negative impact on financial results;Inability to fulfill federal, state and local tax filing requirements in a timely and accurate matter; andIncreased demands of management and associates to the detriment of other corporate initiatives.   The Company’s participation in multi-employer pension plans may have exposures under those plans that could extend beyond what its obligations would be with respect to its employees. The Company participates in, and makes periodic contributions to, one multi-employer pension plan that covers union employees. Multi-employer pension plans are managed by trustee boards comprised of participating employer and labor union representatives, and the employers participating in a multi-employer pension plan are jointly responsible for maintaining the plan’s funding requirements. Based on the most recent information available to the Company, the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities of the multi-employer pension plan substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits. As a result of the Company’s participation, it could experience greater volatility in the overall pension funding obligations. The Company’s obligations may be impacted by the funded status of the plans, the plans’ investment performance, changes in the participant demographics, financial stability of contributing employers and changes in actuarial assumptions. See Note 12 Benefit and Retirement Plans of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. Future results may be affected by various legal proceedings and compliance risk, including those involving product liability, environmental, or other matters.   The Company faces the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event the use of any of its products results in personal injury or property damage. In the event any of the Company’s products prove to be defective, it may be required to recall or redesign such products. The Company is also subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment. The Company could incur substantial costs, including legal expenses, as a result of the noncompliance with, or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under, environmental laws. Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, these various legal proceedings and compliance matters could have a material impact on the business, operating results and financial condition. See Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. The Company’s success depends on its ability to recruit and retain key employees and highly skilled workers in a competitive labor market. If the Company is not successful in recruiting and retaining key employees and highly skilled workers or experiences the unexpected loss of those employees, the operations may be negatively impacted. Additionally, we are and will continue to be dependent upon our senior management team and other key personnel. Losing the services of one or more key members of our management team or other key personnel could adversely affect our operations. In addition, COVID-19 increases the risk that certain senior executive officers or a member of the board of directors could become ill, causing them to be incapacitated or otherwise unable to perform their duties for an extended absence. Furthermore, because of the nature of the disease, multiple people working in close proximity could also become ill simultaneously which could result in the same department having extended absences or a temporary shutdown of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers. This could negatively impact the efficiency and effectiveness of processes and internal controls throughout the Company and our ability to service customers. We have implemented work-from-home policies for certain employees. The effects of our work-from-home policies may negatively impact productivity and disrupt our business, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions and other limitations on our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course. 6 Table of Contents  Terms of collective bargaining agreements and labor disruptions could adversely impact results of operations. Terms of collective bargaining agreements that prevent the Company from competing effectively could adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  The Company is committed to working with those groups to avert or resolve conflicts as they arise.  However, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. We may not be able to collect amounts owed to us. We grant 30-day payment terms to most customers. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, some customers have requested extended payment terms or informed us they will not pay amounts within agreed upon terms. Some of our customers have experienced, and may in the future experience, cash flow and credit-related issues. If the negative economic effects of COVID-19 were to persist or a similar pandemic or another major, unexpected event with negative economic effects were to occur, we may not be able to collect amounts owed to us or such payment may only occur after significant delay. While we perform credit evaluations of our customers, those evaluations may not prevent uncollectible trade accounts receivable. Credit evaluations involve significant management diligence and judgment, especially in the current environment. Should more customers experience liquidity issues than we anticipate, if payment is not received on a timely basis, or if a customer declares bankruptcy or closes stores, we may have difficulty collecting amounts owed to us by these customers, which could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition, and liquidity. Risks related to our industry: The COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate, our ability to keep employees safe from the pandemic, our results of operations, and financial condition.  On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the current coronavirus (“COVID-19”) outbreak to be a global pandemic, and the virus continues to spread in areas where we operate and sell our products. The COVID-19 pandemic and similar issues in the future could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate; our ability to keep employees safe from the pandemic; our results of operations, and financial condition. Public health organizations have recommended, and many governments have implemented, measures from time to time during the pandemic to slow and limit the transmission of the virus, including certain business shutdowns and shelter in place and social distancing requirements. Such preventive measures, or others we may voluntarily put in place, may have a material adverse effect on our business for an indefinite period of time, such as: the potential shut down of certain locations; decreased employee availability; potential border closures; and disruptions to the businesses of our selling channel partners, and others. Our suppliers and customers also face these and other challenges, which have and could continue to lead to a disruption in our supply chain, raw material inflation or the inability to get the raw materials necessary to produce our products, increased shipping, and transport costs, as well as decreased consumer spending and decreased demand for our products.  Although these disruptions may continue to occur, the long-term economic impact and near-term financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including but not limited to, potential near-term or long-term risk of asset impairment, restructuring, and other charges, cannot be reliably quantified or estimated at this time due to the uncertainty of future developments. Continuing inflation may hurt our profitability. Cost inflation including significant increases in ocean container rates, raw materials prices, labor rates, and domestic transportation costs have and could continue to impact profitability.  Continued imbalances between supply and demand for these resources may continue to exert upward pressure on costs.  Our ability to recover these cost increases through price increases may continue to lag the cost increases, resulting in downward pressure on margins. Future success depends on the Company’s ability to manage its global supply chain. The Company acquires raw materials, component parts and certain finished products from external suppliers, both U.S. and foreign.  Many of these suppliers are dependent upon other suppliers in countries other than where they are located. This global interdependence within the Company’s supply chain is subject to delays in delivery, availability, quality, and pricing. Changes in international trade policies including tariffs could disrupt the supply chain, increase cost and reduce competitiveness. The delivery of goods from these suppliers has been and may continue to be delayed by customs, labor issues, geo-political pressures, disruptions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in political, economic, and social conditions, weather, laws and regulations. Unfavorable fluctuations in price, international trade policies, quality, delivery, and availability of these products could continue to adversely affect the Company’s ability to meet demands of customers and cause negative impacts to the Company’s cost structure, profitability and its cash flow. 7 Table of Contents  Enacted tariffs and potential future increases in tariffs on manufactured goods imported from China or other countries could adversely affect our business. The tariff on certain manufactured furniture products imported from China on or after June 1, 2019, is currently 25%. Given ongoing uncertainty in relations, including trade negotiations between the United States and China, it is unclear as to whether the U.S. administration will take further tariff action or perhaps grant relief to actions already put in place.  Inability to reduce acquisition costs or pass-through price increases may have an adverse impact on sales volume, earnings, and liquidity.  Similarly, increases in pricing may have an adverse impact on the competitiveness of the Company’s products relative to other furniture manufacturers with less exposure to the tariff and could also lead to adverse impacts on volume, earnings, and liquidity.  Additionally, a disruption in supply from foreign countries could adversely affect our ability to timely fill customer orders for those products and decrease our sales, earnings, and liquidity. The main foreign countries we source from are Vietnam, China, Thailand, and Mexico. In early 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak in China resulted in the temporary shutdown or reduced capacity of our vendors’ factories. Consequently, we experienced some out-of-stocks, but in some cases we were able to provide substitutions out of inventory on hand, in-transit and from our domestic warehouses, but not enough to entirely mitigate the lost sales. Many of our vendors’ factories are back online, however, the COVID-19 outbreak caused travel restrictions due to government regulations. The travel restrictions have caused labor shortages for our Vietnam suppliers due to limited access to workers from other surrounding countries. Consequently, we may experience shortages of certain products. Our ability to transport products from foreign countries is also dependent on the availability and cost of ocean containers, both of which were materially and adversely impacted by COVID-19. It is unclear how our supply chain could be further impacted by COVID-19, including the spread of new variants, and there are many unknowns including how long we will be impacted, the severity of the impacts and the probability of a recurrence of COVID-19 or similar regional or global pandemics. If we were unsuccessful in obtaining those products from other sources or at comparable cost, a disruption in our supply chain could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition, and liquidity. Competition from U.S. and foreign finished product manufacturers may adversely affect the business, operating results or financial condition. The furniture industry is very competitive and fragmented. The Company competes with U.S. and foreign manufacturers and distributors. As a result, the Company may not be able to maintain or raise the prices of its products in response to competitive pressures or increasing costs. Also, due to the large number of competitors and their wide range of product offerings, the Company may not be able to significantly differentiate its products (through styling, finish, and other construction techniques) from those of its competitors. Additionally, most of our sales are to distribution channels that rely on physical stores to merchandise and sell our products and a significant shift in consumer preference toward purchasing products online could have a materially adverse impact on our sales and operating margin. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated and may continue to increase the shift to online furniture purchases by changing customer shopping patterns and behaviors, including decreased consumer willingness to visit physical retail locations. These and other competitive pressures could cause us to lose market share, revenues, and customers, increase expenditures or reduce prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or liquidity. Future costs of complying with various laws and regulations may adversely impact future operating results. The Company’s business is subject to various laws and regulations which could have a significant impact on operations and the cost to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely impact the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, inadvertently failing to comply with such laws and regulations could produce negative consequences which could adversely impact the Company’s operations. Failure to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer or designer tastes and fashions in a timely manner could adversely affect the Company’s business and decrease sales and earnings. Furniture is a styled product and is subject to rapidly changing consumer and end-user trends and tastes and is highly fashion oriented. If the Company is not able to acquire sufficient fabric variety or if the Company is unable to predict or respond to changes in fashion trends, it may lose sales and have to sell excess inventory at reduced prices. The Company’s products are considered deferrable purchases for consumers during economic downturns. Prolonged negative economic conditions could impact the business. Economic downturns and prolonged negative economic conditions could affect consumer spending habits by decreasing the overall demand for home furnishing products. These events could impact retailers resulting in an impact on the Company’s business. A recovery in the Company’s sales could lag significantly behind a general economic recovery due to the deferrable nature and relatively significant cost of purchasing home furnishing products. 8 Table of Contents"
9,FLXS,FLEXSTEEL INDUSTRIES INC,2020-08-31,"  Risk Factors
 The Company is subject to a variety of risks.  You should carefully consider the risk factors detailed below in conjunction with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Should any of these risks materialize, the Company’s business, financial condition, and future prospects could be negatively impacted.  There may be additional factors that are presently unknown to the Company or that the Company currently believes to be immaterial that could affect its business.  The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant disruption in non-essential retail commerce and may continue to have a material adverse impact on our financial conditions and results of operations. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the current coronavirus (“COVID-19”) outbreak to be a global pandemic. In response to this declaration and the rapid spread of COVID-19 within the United States, Federal, state and local governments throughout the country have imposed varying degrees of restriction on social and commercial activity to promote social distancing in an effort to slow the spread of the illness. These measures have had a significant adverse impact upon many sectors of the economy, including non-essential retail commerce. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected and is expected to continue to adversely affect our operations, supply chains, manufacturing and distribution systems. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience unpredictable reductions in the demand for our products primarily due to our customers closing their stores. We temporarily closed our manufacturing facilities in the United States and Mexico and many of our Corporate employees are working remotely. As of the date of this filing, we have reopened our manufacturing facilities. Whereas most state and local governments have begun to ease restrictions on commercial retail activity, it is possible that a resurgence in COVID-19 cases could prompt a return to tighter restrictions in certain areas of the county. In addition, there may be a risk that one or more of our employees may contract COVID-19, which may result in the need to shutdown a manufacturing or distribution location for an extended period of time, which could interrupt business service to our customers. If COVID-19 spikes in the geographic locations we are in, local governments may mandate a shutdown of one or more of our operating sites, which could interrupt service to our customers. Furthermore, the economic recession brought on by the pandemic may have a continuing adverse impact on consumer demand for our products. We expect the pandemic to have a continuing material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, however, we are unable to predict the extent or nature of these future impacts at this time. 5 Table of Contents  Business information systems could be impacted by disruptions and security breaches. The Company employs information technology systems to support its global business. Security breaches and other disruptions to the Company’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with operations, compromise information belonging to the Company and its customers and suppliers and expose the Company to liability which could adversely impact the Company’s business and reputation. In the ordinary course of business, the Company relies on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. Additionally, the Company collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain areas of its businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls.  While security breaches and other disruptions to the Company’s information technology networks and infrastructure could happen, none have occurred to date that have had a material impact to the Company. Any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage to the Company’s reputation, which could adversely affect the Company’s business. In addition, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have allowed certain of our employees the option to work from home. Although we continue to implement strong physical and cybersecurity measures to ensure that our business operations remain functional and to ensure uninterrupted service to our customers, our systems and our operations remain vulnerable to cyberattacks and other disruptions due to the fact that a significant portion of our employees work remotely as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and we cannot be certain that our mitigation efforts will be effective.   The implementation of a new business information system could disrupt the business. The Company plans to convert certain modules from its legacy ERP system to SAP during the second quarter of fiscal 2021, which include the revenue, expenditure, fixed asset, and financial accounting modules. An ineffective implementation of the new ERP system may result in the following: Disruption of the Company’s domestic and international supply chain;Inability to fill customer orders accurately and on a timely basis;Inability to process payments to suppliers and vendors;Negative impact on financial results;Inability to fulfill federal, state and local tax filing requirements in a timely and accurate matter; andIncreased demands of management and associates to the detriment of other corporate initiatives.   The execution of the Company’s comprehensive restructuring plan. On June 18, 2019, the Company announced it completed the analysis and planning process and set forth the comprehensive transformation program including previously announced activities, restructuring and related expenses, expected benefits both on-going and one-time in nature to be executed over a two year period. As of June 30, 2020, the Company has substantially completed the portion of the restructuring activities related to the exit of the Commercial Office and custom-designed Hospitality product lines. On April 28, 2020, the Company announced it will exit the Vehicle Seating and the remainder of the Hospitality product lines, and subsequently closed its Dubuque, Iowa and Starkville, Mississippi manufacturing facilities. The Company expects to complete the restructuring activities related to the exit of the Vehicle Seating and the remainder of the Hospitality product lines during fiscal 2021. As a result of these planned actions, the Company expects to incur pre-tax restructuring and related expenses of approximately $56 to $58 million over this two-year timeframe of which $25 to $26 million will be cash and $31 - $32 million non-cash. The Company has recorded a total cumulative cost of $55.2 million in restructuring costs through the year ended June 30, 2020. See Note 5 Restructuring of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. Delayed or missed execution or implementation of the restructuring plan may result in the following: Inability to fill customer orders on a timely basis resulting in lost sales;Increased one-time costs to implement;Sub-optimized business model resulting in higher on-going costs and lower profitability;Reduced savings opportunity achieved;Overall negative impact on financial performance including cash flow from operations; andReduced liquidity to fund the daily operations of the business. Future success depends on the Company’s ability to manage its global supply chain. The Company acquires raw materials, component parts and certain finished products from external suppliers, both U.S. and foreign.  Many of these suppliers are dependent upon other suppliers in countries other than where they are located. This global interdependence 6 Table of Contents within the Company’s supply chain is subject to delays in delivery, availability, quality, and pricing. Changes in international trade policies including tariffs could disrupt the supply chain, increase cost and reduce competitiveness. The delivery of goods from these suppliers may be delayed by customs, labor issues, geo-political pressures associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in political, economic and social conditions, weather, laws and regulations. Unfavorable fluctuations in price, international trade policies, quality, delivery and availability of these products could adversely affect the Company’s ability to meet demands of customers and cause negative impacts to the Company’s cost structure, profitability and its cash flow. Recently enacted tariffs and potential future increases in tariffs on manufactured goods imported from China could adversely affect our business. Effective September 24, 2018, the current U.S. administration imposed a 10% tariff on goods imported into the United States from China, including all furniture and furniture components manufactured in China.  Effective May 10, 2019, the tariff was increased to 25% on furniture imported on or after June 1, 2019. As trade negotiations between the United States and China continue, it is unclear as to whether or not the U.S. administration will take further tariff action or perhaps grant relief to actions already put in place.  Inability to reduce acquisition costs or pass through price increases may have an adverse impact on sales volume, earnings and liquidity.  Similarly, increases in pricing may have an adverse impact on the competitiveness of the Company’s products relative to other furniture manufacturers with less exposure to the tariff and could also lead to adverse impacts on volume, earnings and liquidity.

In addition, inadvertently failing to comply with such laws and regulations could produce negative consequences which could adversely impact the Company’s operations. The Company’s participation in multi-employer pension plans may have exposures under those plans that could extend beyond what its obligations would be with respect to its employees. The Company participates in, and makes periodic contributions to, three multi-employer pension plans that cover union employees. Multi-employer pension plans are managed by trustee boards comprised of participating employer and labor union representatives, and the employers participating in a multi-employer pension plan are jointly responsible for maintaining the plan’s funding requirements. Based on the most recent information available to the Company, the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in one of the multi-employer pension plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits. As a result of the Company’s participation, it could experience greater volatility in the overall pension funding obligations. The Company’s obligations may be 7 Table of Contents impacted by the funded status of the plans, the plans’ investment performance, changes in the participant demographics, financial stability of contributing employers and changes in actuarial assumptions. See Note 12 Benefit and Retirement Plans of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. Future results may be affected by various legal proceedings and compliance risk, including those involving product liability, environmental, or other matters.   The Company faces the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event the use of any of its products results in personal injury or property damage. In the event any of the Company’s products prove to be defective, it may be required to recall or redesign such products. The Company is also subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment. The Company could incur substantial costs, including legal expenses, as a result of the noncompliance with, or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under, environmental laws. Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, these various legal proceedings and compliance matters could have a material impact on the business, operating results and financial condition. See Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. The Company’s success depends on its ability to recruit and retain key employees and highly skilled workers in a competitive labor market. If the Company is not successful in recruiting and retaining key employees and highly skilled workers or experiences the unexpected loss of those employees, the operations may be negatively impacted. Additionally, we are and will continue to be dependent upon our senior management team and other key personnel. Losing the services of one or more key members of our management team or other key personnel could adversely affect our operations.

 The Company is subject to a variety of risks.  You should carefully consider the risk factors detailed below in conjunction with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Should any of these risks materialize, the Company’s business, financial condition, and future prospects could be negatively impacted.  There may be additional factors that are presently unknown to the Company or that the Company currently believes to be immaterial that could affect its business. Business information systems could be impacted by disruptions and security breaches. The Company employs information technology systems to support its global business. Security breaches and other disruptions to the Company’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with operations, compromise information belonging to the Company and its customers and suppliers and expose the Company to liability which could adversely impact the Company’s business and reputation. In the ordinary course of business, the Company relies on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. Additionally, the Company collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain areas of its businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls.  While security breaches and other disruptions to the Company’s information technology networks and infrastructure could happen, none have occurred to date that have had a material impact to the Company. Any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage to the Company’s reputation, which could adversely affect the Company’s business. The implementation of a new business information system could disrupt the business. The Company deployed its new business information system in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, retiring one of the Company’s legacy systems.  Management characterizes this deployment as a failed implementation which resulted in higher than expected disruption to customers, significant loss of share within the ecommerce space due to poor servicing of demand, higher service level penalties from key customers and higher promotional costs aimed at share recovery throughout the year as Management stabilized the system.  During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company announced an impairment of $18.7 million representing a significant portion of the new business information system asset.  In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company announced a further impairment of $2.6 million due to additional abandoned components being identified through the future ERP analysis and planning phase.  Additionally, the Company announced a path forward that will enable both a simplification of the software configuration and approach for the remainder of the business as well as a reduction in on-going run rate costs. 4  An ineffective implementation of the new business information system may result in the following: ●Disruption of the Company’s domestic and international supply chain; ●Inability to fill customer orders accurately and on a timely basis; ●Inability to process payments to suppliers and vendors; ●Negative impact on financials; ●Inability to fulfill federal, state and local tax filing requirements in a timely and accurate matter; and ●Increased demands of management and associates to the detriment of other corporate initiatives.  The execution of the Company’s comprehensive restructuring plan. On June 18, 2019, the Company announced it completed the analysis and planning process and set forth the comprehensive transformation program including previously announced activities, restructuring and related expenses, expected benefits both on-going and one time in nature to be executed over the next two years.  The Company expects to incur pre-tax restructuring and related expenses of approximately $48.0 million to $53.0 million over this two-year timeframe of which approximately $36.0 million to $40.0 million will be cash including $9.0 million for environmental remediation and $12.0 million to $13.0 million non-cash. The Company has recorded a total of $10.0 million in restructuring costs during the year ended June 30, 2019.  In addition, $7.7 million related to inventory impairment was recorded in our cost of goods sold. Delayed or missed execution or implementation of the restructuring plan may result in the following: ●Inability to fill customer orders on a timely basis resulting in lost sales; ●Increased one-time costs to implement; ●Sub-optimized business model resulting in higher on-going costs and lower profitability; ●Reduced savings opportunity achieved; ●Overall negative impact on financial performance including cash flow from operations; and ●Reduced liquidity to fund the daily operations of the business. Future success depends on the Company’s ability to manage its global supply chain. The Company acquires raw materials, component parts and certain finished products from external suppliers, both U.S. and foreign.  Many of these suppliers are dependent upon other suppliers in countries other than where they are located. This global interdependence within the Company’s supply chain is subject to delays in delivery, availability, quality, and pricing.  Changes in international trade policies including tariffs could disrupt the supply chain, increase cost and reduce competitiveness. The delivery of goods from these suppliers may be delayed by customs, labor issues, changes in political, economic and social conditions, weather, laws and regulations. Unfavorable fluctuations in price, international trade policies, quality, delivery and availability of these products could adversely affect the Company’s ability to meet demands of customers and cause negative impacts to the Company’s cost structure, profitability and its cash flow. Effective September 24, 2018, the current U.S. administration imposed a 10% tariff on goods imported into the United States from China, including all furniture and furniture components manufactured in China.  Effective May 10, 2019, the tariff was increased to 25% on furniture imported on or after June 1, 2019.  As trade negotiations between the United States and China continue, it is unclear as to whether or not the U.S. administration will take further tariff action or perhaps grant relief to actions already put in place.  In fiscal 2019, approximately 42% of the Company’s sales were imported from China. Inability to reduce acquisition costs or pass through price increases may have an adverse impact on sales volume, earnings and liquidity.  Similarly, increases in pricing may have an adverse impact on the competitiveness of the Company’s products relative to other furniture manufacturers with less exposure to the tariff and could also lead to adverse impacts on volume, earnings and liquidity. Competition from U.S. and foreign finished product manufacturers may adversely affect the business, operating results or financial condition. The furniture industry is very competitive and fragmented. The Company competes with U.S. and foreign manufacturers and distributors.  As a result, the Company may not be able to maintain or raise the prices of its products in response to competitive pressures or increasing costs.  Also, due to the large number of competitors and their wide range of product offerings, the Company may not be able to significantly differentiate its products (through styling, finish and other construction techniques) from those of its competitors.  As a result, the Company is continually subject to the risk of losing market share, which may lower its sales and earnings. Future costs of complying with various laws and regulations may adversely impact future operating results.  The Company’s business is subject to various laws and regulations which could have a significant impact on operations and the cost to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely impact the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.5  In addition, inadvertently failing to comply with such laws and regulations could produce negative consequences which could adversely impact the Company’s operations. The Company’s participation in multi-employer pension plans may have exposures under those plans that could extend beyond what its obligations would be with respect to its employees. The Company participates in, and makes periodic contributions to, three multi-employer pension plans that cover union employees.

The Company’s obligations may be impacted by the funded status of the plans, the plans’ investment performance, changes in the participant demographics, financial stability of contributing employers and changes in actuarial assumptions. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. Future results may be affected by various legal proceedings and compliance risk, including those involving product liability, environmental, or other matters.   The Company faces the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event the use of any of its products results in personal injury or property damage. In the event any of the Company’s products prove to be defective, it may be required to recall or redesign such products. The Company is also subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment. The Company could incur substantial costs, including legal expenses, as a result of the noncompliance with, or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under, environmental laws. Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, these various legal proceedings and compliance matters could have a material impact on the business, operating results and financial condition. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company’s success depends on its ability to recruit and retain key employees and highly skilled workers in a competitive labor market. If the Company is not successful in recruiting and retaining key employees and highly skilled workers or experiences the unexpected loss of those employees, the operations may be negatively impacted.  Failure to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer or designer tastes and fashions in a timely manner could adversely affect the Company’s business and decrease sales and earnings. Furniture is a styled product and is subject to rapidly changing consumer and end-user trends and tastes and is highly fashion oriented. If the Company is not able to acquire sufficient fabric variety or if the Company is unable to predict or respond to changes in fashion trends, it may lose sales and have to sell excess inventory at reduced prices. The Company’s products are considered deferrable purchases for consumers during economic downturns.  Prolonged negative economic conditions could impact the business. Economic downturns and prolonged negative economic conditions could affect consumer spending habits by decreasing the overall demand for home furnishings and contract products. These events could impact retailers, recreational seating and healthcare businesses resulting in an impact on the Company’s business. A recovery in the Company’s sales could lag significantly behind a general economic recovery due to the deferrable nature and relatively significant cost of home furnishings and contract products purchases. Terms of collective bargaining agreements and labor disruptions could adversely impact results of operations. Terms of collective bargaining agreements that prevent the Company from competing effectively could adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  The Company is committed to working with those groups to avert or resolve conflicts as they arise.  However, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. "

 Ourbusiness is subject to a variety of risks. You should carefully consider the risk factors detailed below in conjunction with theother information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Should any of these risks actually materialize, our business,financial condition, and future prospects could be negatively impacted. There may be additional factors that are presently unknownto us or that we currently believe to be immaterial that could affect our business. Ourbusiness information systems could be impacted by disruptions and security breaches. TheCompany employs information technology systems to support its global business. Security breaches and other disruptions to theCompany’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with the Company’s operations, compromise informationbelonging to the Company and its customers and suppliers, and expose the Company to liability which could adversely impact theCompany’s business and reputation. In the ordinary course of business, the Company relies on information technology networksand systems to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes andactivities. Additionally, the Company collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and may haveaccess to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulationsand customer-imposed controls. While security breaches and other disruptions to the Company’s information technology networksand infrastructure could happen, none have occurred to date that have had a material impact to the Company. There may be otherchallenges and risks as the Company upgrades and standardizes its business information systems. Any such events could result inlegal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage to the Company’sreputation, which could adversely affect the Company’s business. Ouroperations may be impacted by various business interruptions. Uncharacteristicor significant weather conditions, natural disasters, political or civil unrest in the countries in which we operate and sourceproducts from can cause property damage or interrupt our business operations. These events can lead to damaged property, lostsales or lost customers and could adversely affect our short-term results of operations. 4  Ifwe are unable to obtain bank credit or generate cash flow from our operations, our financial position, liquidity and results ofoperations could suffer. Weare dependent on a stable, liquid and well-functioning financial system to fund our operations and capital investments. Our continuedaccess to these markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of capital markets, our operating performance andmaintaining a strong balance sheet. If we lose our ability to generate cash flow from operations or our availability to borrowwith our financial institutions to meet capital and operational needs, our liquidity and results of operations could suffer. Ourproducts are considered deferrable purchases for consumers during economic downturns. Prolonged negative economic conditions couldimpact our business. Economicdownturns and prolonged negative economic conditions could affect consumer spending habits by decreasing the overall demand forhome furnishings and commercial products. These events could impact retailers, offices, hospitality, recreational vehicle seatingand healthcare businesses resulting in an impact on our business. A recovery in our sales could lag significantly behind a generaleconomic recovery due to the deferrable nature and relatively significant cost of home furnishings and commercial products purchases. Ourfuture success depends on our ability to manage our global supply chain. Weacquire raw materials, component parts and certain finished products from external suppliers, both U.S. and foreign. Many of thesesuppliers are dependent upon other suppliers in countries other than where they are located. This global interdependence withinour supply chain is subject to delays in delivery, availability, quality and pricing (including tariffs) of products. The deliveryof goods from these suppliers may be delayed by customs, labor issues, changes in political, economic and social conditions, lawsand regulations. Unfavorable fluctuations in price, quality, delivery and availability of these products could negatively affectour ability to meet demands of our customers and have a negative impact on product margin. Competitionfrom U.S. and foreign finished product manufacturers may adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. Thefurniture industry is very competitive and fragmented. We compete with U.S. and foreign manufacturers and distributors. As a result,we may not be able to maintain or raise the prices of our products in response to competitive pressures or increasing costs. Also,due to the large number of competitors and their wide range of product offerings, we may not be able to significantly differentiateour products (through styling, finish and other construction techniques) from those of our competitors. As a result, we are continuallysubject to the risk of losing market share, which may lower our sales and earnings. Ourfailure to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer or designer tastes and fashions in a timely manner could adversely affectour business and decrease our sales and earnings. Furnitureis a styled product and is subject to rapidly changing consumer and end-user trends and tastes and is highly fashion oriented,and if we are not able to acquire sufficient fabric variety, or if we are unable to predict or respond to changes in fashion trends,we may lose sales and have to sell excess inventory at reduced prices. Oursuccess depends on our ability to recruit and retain key employees. Ifwe are not successful in recruiting and retaining key employees or experience the unexpected loss of key employees, our operationsmay be negatively impacted. Futurecosts of complying with various laws and regulations may adversely impact future operating results. Ourbusiness is subject to various laws and regulations which could have a significant impact on our operations and the cost to complywith such laws and regulations could adversely impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition,failure to comply with such laws and regulations, even inadvertently, could produce negative consequences which could adverselyimpact our operations. Termsof collective bargaining agreements and labor disruptions could adversely impact our results of operations. Termsof collective bargaining agreements that prevent us from competing effectively could adversely affect our financial condition,results of operations and cash flows. We are committed to working with those groups to avert or resolve conflicts as they arise.However, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. 5  Dueto our participation in multi-employer pension plans, we may have exposures under those plans that could extend beyond what ourobligations would be with respect to our employees. Weparticipate in, and make periodic contributions to, three multi-employer pension plans that cover union employees. Multi-employerpension plans are managed by trustee boards comprised of participating employer and labor union representatives, and the employersparticipating in a multi-employer pension plan are jointly responsible for maintaining the plan’s funding requirements.Based on the most recent information available to us, we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities inthe multi-employer pension plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits. As a result of ourparticipation, we could experience greater volatility in our overall pension funding obligations. Our obligations may be impactedby the funded status of the plans, the plans’ investment performance, changes in the participant demographics, financialstability of contributing employers and changes in actuarial assumptions. Ourfuture results may be affected by various legal proceedings and compliance risk, including those involving product liability,environmental, or other matters.  Weface the business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of any of our products results in personalinjury or property damage. In the event any of our products prove to be defective, we may be required to recall or redesign suchproducts. We are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materialsinto the environment.

 Our business is subject to a variety of risks.  You should carefully consider the risk factors detailed below in conjunction with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Should any of these risks actually materialize, our business, financial condition, and future prospects could be negatively impacted.  These risks are not the only ones we face.  There may be additional factors that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial that could affect our business. We may lose market share due to competition, which would decrease our future sales and earnings. The furniture industry is very competitive and fragmented.  We compete with many domestic and foreign manufacturers and distributors.  Some competitors have greater financial resources than we have and some often offer extensively advertised, well-recognized, branded products.  Foreign producers typically have lower selling prices due to their lower operating costs.  As a result, we may not be able to maintain or raise the prices of our products in response to such competitive pressures or increasing costs.  Also, due to the large number of competitors and their wide range of product offerings, we may not be able to differentiate our products (through styling, finish and other construction techniques) from those of our competitors.  Large retail furniture dealers have the ability to obtain offshore sourcing on their own.  As a result, we are continually subject to the risk of losing market share, which may lower our sales and earnings. Our offshore capabilities provide flexibility in product offerings and pricing to meet competitive pressures, but this approach may adversely affect our ability to service customers, which could lower future sales and earnings. We acquire a portion of our finished goods and components used in our manufacturing operations from foreign vendors. These vendors are located primarily in Southeast Asia. The delivery of goods from these vendors may be delayed for reasons not typically encountered with U.S. suppliers including shipment delays caused by customs, labor issues, changes in political, economic and social conditions, laws and regulations. This could make it more difficult to service our customers resulting in lower sales and earnings. If we experience the loss of large customers through business failures (or for other reasons) or any extended business interruptions at our manufacturing facilities, this could decrease our future sales and earnings. Although we have no customers that individually represent 10% or more of our net sales, the possibility of business failures by, or the loss of, large customers could decrease our future sales and earnings.  Lost sales may be difficult to replace and any amounts owed to us may become uncollectible.  Our inability to fill customer orders during an extended business interruption could negatively impact existing customer relationships resulting in market share decreases.  4  At times it is necessary we discontinue certain relationships with customers who do not meet our growth, credit or profitability standards.  Until realignment is established, there can be a decrease in near-term sales and earnings.  We continually review relationships with our customers and future realignments are possible based upon such ongoing reviews. Our failure to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer tastes and fashions in a timely manner could adversely affect our business and decrease our sales and earnings. Furniture is a styled product and is subject to rapidly changing consumer trends and tastes and is highly fashion oriented, and if we are not able to acquire sufficient fabric variety, or if we are unable to predict or respond to changes in fashion trends, we may lose sales and have to sell excess inventory at reduced prices. If we experience fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials, this could cause manufacturing delays, adversely affect our ability to provide goods to our customers and increase our costs, any of which could decrease our sales and earnings. We use various types of wood, fabrics, leathers, upholstered filling material, high carbon spring steel, bar and wire stock and other raw materials in manufacturing furniture.  Because we are dependent on outside suppliers for all of our raw material needs, we must obtain sufficient quantities of quality raw materials from our suppliers at acceptable prices and in a timely manner.  We do not utilize long-term supply contracts with our suppliers.  Unfavorable fluctuations in the price, quality and availability of these raw materials could negatively affect our ability to meet demands of our customers and have a negative impact on product margin.  The inability to meet our customers demands could result in the loss of future sales, and we may not always be able to pass along price increases to our customers due to competitive and marketing pressures. Future costs of complying with various laws and regulations may adversely impact future operating results. Our business is subject to various laws and regulations, such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, the Pension Protection Act of 2006, the Lacey Act, as amended in 2008 to cover plants and trees, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, the Security and Accountability for Every (SAFE) Port Act of 2006, the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act as well as many others. Partially in response to the financial markets crises and the global economic recession, regulatory initiatives have accelerated in the United States and abroad. These initiatives could have a significant impact on our operations and the cost to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, failure to comply with such laws and regulations, even inadvertently, could produce negative consequences which could adversely impact our operations. Terms of collective bargaining agreements and labor disruptions could adversely impact our results of operations. We employ approximately 1,400 people, 20% of whom are covered by union contracts.  Where a significant portion of our workers are unionized, our ability to implement productivity improvements and effect savings with respect to health care, pension and other retirement costs is more restricted than in many nonunion operations as a result of various restrictions specified in our collective bargaining agreements.  Terms of collective bargaining agreements that prevent us from competing effectively could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  We are committed to working with those groups to resolve conflicts as they arise.  However, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. Due to our participation in three multi-employer pension plans, we may have exposures under those plans that could extend beyond what our obligations would be with respect to our employees. We participate in, and make periodic contributions to, three multi-employer pension plans that cover 60% of our union employees.  Multi-employer pension plans are managed by trustee boards comprised of participating employer and labor union representatives, and the employers participating in a multi-employer pension plan are jointly responsible for maintaining the plans funding requirements. Based on the most recent information available to us, we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in the multi-employer pension plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits.  As a result of our participation, we could experience greater volatility in our overall pension funding obligations.  Our obligations may be impacted by the funded status of the plans, the plans investment performance, changes in the participant demographics, financial stability of contributing employers and changes in actuarial assumptions.  Proposed changes in generally accepted accounting principles could result in a requirement to record a portion of the multi-employer plans funded status as a liability in our financial statements.  5  We are, and may in the future be, a party to legal proceedings and claims, including those involving product liability or environmental matters, some of which claim significant damages and could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We face the business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of any of our products results in personal injury or property damage.  In the event any of our products prove to be defective, we may be required to recall or redesign such products.  We maintain insurance against product liability claims, but there can be no assurance such coverage will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us or that such coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred. Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, we can offer no assurance future litigation will not have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results or financial condition.  We are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment and we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with, or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under, environmental laws. "

We may reject goods that do not meet our specifications and either manufacture or find alternative vendors potentially at a higher cost, or may be forced to discontinue the product.  Also, delivery of goods from our foreign sourcing vendors may be delayed for reasons not typically encountered with domestic manufacturing or sourcing, such as shipment delays caused by customs or labor issues.  Changes in political, economic, and social conditions, as well as laws and regulations in the other countries from which we source products could adversely affect us.  This could make it more difficult for us to service our customers. International trade policies of the United States and countries from which we source products could adversely affect us. Imposition of trade sanctions relating to imports, taxes, import duties and other charges on imports could increase our costs and decrease our earnings.  Also, significant fluctuations of foreign exchange rates against the value of the U.S. dollar could increase costs and decrease earnings. Efforts to realign manufacturing could decrease our near-term earnings. We continually review our manufacturing operations and offshore sourcing capabilities.  As a result, we sometimes realign those operations and capabilities and institute cost savings programs.

If we are unable to predict or respond to changes in these trends and tastes in a timely manner, we may lose sales and have to sell excess inventory at reduced prices.  This could lower our sales and earnings. If we experience the loss of large customers through business failures (or for other reasons), any extended business interruptions at our manufacturing facilities, or problems with our fabric suppliers, this could decrease our future sales and earnings.  Although we have no customers that individually represent 10% or more of our net sales, the possibility of business failures by, or the loss of, large customers could decrease our future sales and earnings.  Lost sales may be difficult to replace and any amounts owed to us may become uncollectible.  Our inability to fill customer orders during an extended business interruption could negatively impact existing customer relationships resulting in market share decreases.  Upholstered furniture is highly fashion oriented, and if we are not able to acquire sufficient fabric variety, or if we are unable to predict or respond to changes in fashion trends, we may lose sales and have to sell excess inventory at reduced prices.  At times it is necessary we discontinue certain relationships with customers (retailers, O.E.M. manufacturers and others) who do not meet our growth, credit or profitability standards.  Until realignment is established, there can be a decrease in near-term sales and earnings.  We continually review relationships with our customers and future realignments are possible based upon such ongoing reviews.  We are, and may in the future be, a party to legal proceedings and claims, including those involving product liability or environmental matters, some of which claim significant damages and could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We face the business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of any of our products results in personal injury or property damage.  In the event any of our products prove to be defective, we may be required to recall or redesign such products.  We maintain insurance against product liability claims, but there can be no assurance such coverage will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us or that such coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred.  Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, we can offer no assurance future litigation will not have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results or financial condition.  We are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment and we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with, or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under, environmental laws.  We may become subject to litigation or other contingentliabilities, downgrades in our credit ratings, or potential additional cash and noncash charges because of our error corrections in our Consolidated FinancialStatements which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. As described in the Explanatory Note immediately preceding PartI, Item 1, and in Note 19 Error Corrections of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we identifiedcertain errors in the reconciliation of accounts payable at June 30, 2008. As a result of these errors, we restated, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, certainof our previously filed financial statements. We could be subject to litigation or other contingent liabilities, and credit rating downgrades, or cashor non-cash charges due to these errors, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. 7 We may engage in acquisitions and investments in businesses, which could dilute our earnings per share and decrease the value of our common stock.  As part of our business strategy, we may make acquisitions and investments in businesses that offer complementary products.  Risks commonly encountered in acquisitions include the possibility that we pay more than the acquired company or assets are worth, the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired business, the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of our management from ongoing business.  Consideration paid for future acquisitions could be in the form of cash or stock or a combination thereof.  Dilution to existing stockholders and to earnings per share may result in connection with any such future acquisition.  We may experience impairment of our long-lived assets, which would decrease our earnings and net worth.  Accounting rules require that long-lived assets be tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.  We have substantial long-lived assets, consisting primarily of property, plant and equipment, which based upon such events or changes in circumstances there could be a write-down of all or a portion of these assets negatively impacting earnings. Restrictive covenants in our existing credit facilities may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.  Our existing credit facilities limit our ability, among other things, to: incur additional indebtedness; make investments; consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and create liens.   The restrictions contained in our credit facilities could: limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans; and adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our best interest. A breach of any of these restrictive covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our credit facilities.  If a default occurs, the lender under our credit agreement may elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable which would result in an event of default under our outstanding notes.  The lender will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings.  If we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due, the lender will also have the right to initiate collection proceedings against us.  If the indebtedness under our credit facilities were to be accelerated, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the indebtedness under the credit facilities and ourother indebtedness. Terms of collective bargaining agreements and labor disruptions could adversely impact our results of operations. We employ approximately 2,000 people, 30% of whom are covered by union contracts.  Where a significant portion of our workers are unionized, our ability to implement productivity improvements and effect savings with respect to health care, pension and other retirement costs is more restricted than in many nonunion operations as a result of various restrictions specified in our collective bargaining agreements.  Terms of collective bargaining agreements that prevent us from competing effectively could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  We are committed to working with those groups to resolve conflicts as they arise.  However, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. We may have materialweaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and the existence of material weaknesses, if any, may have an adverse impact on our stockprice. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluations of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. Our internal control over financial reporting, however, is designed to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of internal control over financialreporting are met. The existence of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may have an adverse impact on our stock price. 8"
2,FLXS,FLEXSTEEL INDUSTRIES INC,2007-08-29,"Risk Factors
  Our business is subject to a variety of risks. You should carefully consider the risk factors detailed below in conjunction with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Should any of these risks actually materialize, our business, financial condition, and future prospects could be negatively impacted. These risks are not the only ones we face. There may be additional factors that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial that could affect our business.  We may lose market share due to competition, which would decrease our future sales and earnings. The furniture industry is very competitive and fragmented. We compete with many domestic and foreign manufacturers. Some competitors have greater financial resources than we have and some often offer extensively advertised, well-recognized, branded products. Additionally, competition from foreign producers has increased dramatically in the past few years. These foreign producers typically have lower selling prices due to their lower operating costs. As a result, we may not be able to maintain or to raise the prices of our products in response to such competitive pressures or increasing costs. Also, due to the large number of competitors and their wide range of product offerings, we may not be able to differentiate our products (through styling, finish and other construction techniques) from those of our competitors. Large retail furniture dealers have the ability to obtain offshoresourcing on their own. As a result, we are continually subject to the risk of losing market share, which may lower our sales and earnings. We have been increasing our offshore capabilities to provide flexibility in product offerings and pricing to meet competitive pressures, but this approach may adversely affect our ability to service customers, which could lower future sales and earnings. Our sourcing vendors may not supply goods that meet our manufacturing, quality or safety specifications, in a timely manner and at an acceptable price. We may reject goods that do not meet our specifications and either manufacture or find alternative vendors potentially at a higher cost, or may be forced to discontinue the product. Also, delivery of goods from our foreign sourcing vendors may be delayed for reasons not typically encountered with domestic manufacturing or sourcing, such as shipment delays caused by customs or labor issues.  Changes in political, economic, and social conditions, as well as laws and regulations in the other countries from which we source products could adversely affect us. This could make it more difficult for us to service our customers. International trade policies of the United States and countries from which we source products could adversely affect us. Imposition of trade sanctions relating to imports, taxes, import duties and other charges on imports could increase our costs and decrease our earnings. Also, significant fluctuations of foreign exchange rates against the value of the U.S. dollar could increase costs and decrease earnings. Efforts to realign manufacturing could decrease our near-term earnings. We continually review our manufacturing operations and offshore sourcing capabilities. As a result, we sometimes realign those operations and capabilities and institute cost savings programs. These programs can include the consolidation and integration of facilities, functions, systems and procedures. We also may shift certain products to or from domestic manufacturing to offshore sourcing. These realignments and cost savings programs generally involve some initial cost and can result in decreases in our near-term earnings until we achieve the expected cost reductions. We may not always accomplish these actions as quickly as anticipated, and we may not fully achieve the expected cost reductions. An economic downturn could adversely affect our business and decrease our sales and earnings. Economic downturns could affect consumer-spending habits by decreasing the overall demand for home furnishings, recreational vehicles and commercial products and adversely affect our business. Interest rates, consumer confidence, housing starts, and geopolitical factors that affect many other businesses are particularly significant to us because our products are consumer goods.  5 If we experience fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials, this could cause manufacturing delays, adversely affect our ability to provide goods to our customers and increase our costs, any of which could decrease our sales and earnings.  We use various types of wood, fabrics, leathers, upholstered filling material, high carbon spring steel, bar and wire stock and other raw materials in manufacturing furniture. Because we are dependent on outside suppliers for all of our raw material needs, we must obtain sufficient quantities of quality raw materials from our suppliers at acceptable prices and in a timely manner. We have no long-term supply contracts with our suppliers. Unfavorable fluctuations in the price, quality and availability of these raw materials could negatively affect our ability to meet demands of our customers. The inability to meet our customers demands could result in the loss of future sales, and we may not always be able to pass along price increases to our customers due to competitive and marketing pressures.  Our failure to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer tastes and fashions in a timely manner could adversely affect our business and decrease our sales and earnings.  Furniture is a styled product and is subject to rapidly changing consumer trends and tastes. If we are unable to predict or respond to changes in these trends and tastes in a timely manner, we may lose sales and have to sell excess inventory at reduced prices. This could lower our sales and earnings. If we experience the loss of large customers through business failures (or for other reasons), any extended business interruptions at our manufacturing facilities, or problems with our fabric suppliers, this could decrease our future sales and earnings.  Although we have no customers that individually represent 10% or more of our net sales, the possibility of business failures by, or the loss of, large customers could decrease our future sales and earnings. Lost sales may be difficult to replace and any amounts owed to us may become uncollectible. Our inability to fill customer orders during an extended business interruption could negatively impact existing customer relationships resulting in market share decreases.  The financial condition of some of our fabric suppliers could impede their ability to provide these products to us in a timely matter. We have seen the number of domestic suppliers declining, and a majority of those larger suppliers that remain are experiencing financial difficulties. In addition, upholstered furniture is highly fashion oriented, and if we are not able to acquire sufficient fabric variety, or if we are unable to predict or respond to changes in fashion trends, we may lose sales and have to sell excess inventory at reduced prices.  At times it is necessary we discontinue certain relationships with customers (retailers) who do not meet our growth, credit or profitability standards. Until realignment is established, there can be a decrease in near-term sales and earnings. We continually review relationships with our customers (retailers) and future realignments are possible based upon such ongoing reviews.  We are, and may in the future be, a party to legal proceedings and claims, including those involving product liability or environmental matters, some of which claim significant damages and could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We face the business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of any of our products results in personal injury or property damage. In the event any of our products prove to be defective, we may be required to recall or redesign such products. We maintain insurance against product liability claims, but there can be no assurance such coverage will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us or that such coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred.  Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, we can offer no assurance future litigation will not have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results or financial condition. We are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment and we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with, or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under, environmental laws.  We may engage in acquisitions and investments in businesses, which could dilute our earnings per share and decrease the value of our common stock.  As part of our business strategy, we may make acquisitions and investments in businesses that offer complementary products.
