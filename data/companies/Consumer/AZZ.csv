Our business is subject to a variety of risks, including, but not limited to, the risks described below, which we believe are the most significant risks and uncertainties facing our business.  Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or not described below may also impair our business operations in the future.  If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations and future growth could be negatively or materially impacted. Carefully consider the risks described below and all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when deciding whether to invest in our securities or otherwise evaluating our business. You should also refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements contained here under the heading ""Forward-Looking Statements.""Risks Related to Our Business and Operations Our business segments operate in highly competitive markets.Competition is based on a number of factors, including price. Certain competitors in each of our segments may have lower cost structures or larger economies of scale on raw materials and may, therefore, be able to provide their manufactured solutions at lower prices than we are able to provide.  If our response to competitor pricing actions is not timely, we could be impacted by loss of market share.  We cannot be certain that our competitors will not develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide manufactured solutions that are superior to ours in price, delivery time or quality in the future.  Similarly, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position within our industries, maintain our customer base at current levels or increase our customer base.Our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Our quarterly results may be materially and adversely affected by the following, among others: •changes in political actions and landscapes across the globe, including global conflicts;•unstable political economic conditions and public health issues or crisis, such as a pandemic, delaying our or our customer's operations;•timing and volume of work under new or existing agreements;•general economic conditions;•fluctuations in the budgetary spending of customers, including seasonality;•increases in manufacturing or transportation costs;•variations in margins, due to sales price or manufacturing complexities, of projects performed during any particular quarter;•losses experienced in our operations not otherwise covered by insurance; •delays of raw materials or component suppliers;•a change in the demand of our manufactured solutions caused by severe weather conditions;•a change in the mix of our customers, contracts and business;•modifications or changes in customer delivery schedules;•ability or willingness of customers to timely pay their invoices when owed to us; and•changes in interest rates.Accordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results expected for any other quarter or for the entire year. 9Table of ContentsOur business requires skilled labor, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees.Our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability could be limited by an inability to employ, train and retain skilled personnel necessary to meet our labor requirements.  A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a shortage of skilled personnel, increases in labor-related costs, or both. It is necessary that we maintain a skilled labor force to operate efficiently and support our growth strategy.  Labor shortages or increased labor-related costs could impair our ability to maintain our profit margins or impact our ability to sustain and grow our sales.Technological innovations by competitors may make existing production methods obsolete.The manufactured solutions we provide require evolving technologies for success in the markets we serve.  The competitive environments can be highly sensitive to technological innovation.  It is possible for our competitors, or new market place entrants, both foreign and domestic, to develop new manufactured solution methods or technologies which could make our existing manufactured solutions or methods obsolete or at least hasten their obsolescence or materially reduce our competitive advantage in the markets that we serve.Our business segments are cyclical and are sensitive to economic downturns.Our business often aligns with the economic environments that we operate within, especially in our Precoat Metals segment, and is subject to seasonality within the annual operating cycle of the business.  Our customers may delay or cancel new or previously planned projects.  If there is a downturn in the general economies in which we operate, there could be a material adverse effect on price levels and the quantity of goods and services purchased by our customers, which could adversely impact our sales, consolidated results from operations and cash flows.  A number of factors, including financing conditions and potential bankruptcies in the industries we serve, could adversely affect our customers and their ability or willingness to fund their internal projects in the future and pay for services.  Certain economic conditions may also impact the financial condition of one or more of our key suppliers, which could affect our ability to secure raw materials and components to meet our customers’ demand for our manufactured solutions in the future.  Other various factors impact demand for our manufactured solutions, including the price of commodities (such as zinc, natural gas or other commodities), paint, economic forecasts and financial markets.  Uncertainty in the economy and financial markets could impact our customers and could, in turn, severely impact the demand for corporate infrastructure projects which could result in a reduction in orders for our manufactured solutions.  All of these factors combined together could materially impact our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.International events and political issues may adversely affect our operating segments.A portion of the sales from our segments are from markets outside the U.S.  The occurrence of any of the risks described below could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition: •political and economic instability in the countries where we conduct business; •social unrest, acts of war terrorism, severe weather events, other natural conditions, and global outbreaks of contagious diseases;•inflation, or hyper-inflation or recession;•significant currency fluctuations, currency devaluations or restrictions on currency conversions;•governmental activities that limit or disrupt markets, restrict payments or limit the movement of funds;•trade restrictions, tariffs and economic embargoes by the United States or other countries; and•travel restrictions placed upon personnel.Catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.The occurrence of catastrophic events ranging from acts of war and terrorism, severe weather events and other natural conditions such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes and other severe weather conditions, or the outbreaks of epidemic, pandemic or contagious diseases could potentially cause future disruption in our business.  At this time, the ongoing armed conflicts in Ukraine, Israel and the broader Middle East have not materially impacted our operations.  However, any disruption of our customers or suppliers and their respective contract manufacturers from the ongoing conflicts or new conflicts could likely impact our future sales and operating results.  In addition, the spread of contagious diseases, could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, and result in an economic downturn that could affect the demand for our manufactured solutions.  These situations are outside of the Company’s control and any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.10Table of ContentsSupply chain disruptions and inflation in the price of energy and certain raw materials for our business segments may adversely affect our operations.Within our AZZ Metal Coatings segment, zinc and natural gas costs represent a large portion of our cost of sales. In our AZZ Precoat Metals segment, paint and natural gas costs represent a large portion of our cost of sales.For both segments, operating margins could be negatively impacted by supply chain disruptions and adverse price movements in the market for zinc, natural gas, and paint.  Unanticipated commodity price increases could significantly increase our operating costs if we cannot pass the costs to our customers, and could potentially adversely affect profitability.  The following factors, which are beyond our control, affect the price of raw materials and energy for our segments:  •supply and demand; •freight costs and transportation availability; •trade duties and taxes; and •labor disputes. We seek to maintain our operating margins by increasing the price of our manufactured solutions in response to increased costs but may not be successful in passing these increased costs of operation through to our customers. Even if successful, there is no guarantee the increased price would not negatively affect the volume of future orders.  While the Company is exposed to inflationary pressures for zinc, and energy, the Company evaluates market conditions and follows a general practice of locking in the fixed premiums associated with zinc on annual contracts unless market conditions dictate otherwise, and we enter into energy contracts for gas and electricity normally for durations of six- to twelve-months to reduce risks associated with large fluctuations in these commodities. No other individual material input cost represents a significant portion of our cost of sales other than those previously discussed. We believe for the remaining input costs any price increase would not be able to significantly affect margins even if the increased costs could not be passed on to our customers.A failure in our operational information systems or the occurrence of cyber incidents or cyber security attacks at any of our facilities, or those of our third-party suppliers and service providers, may adversely affect our financial results. Such incidents or cyber security attacks may also result in faulty business decisions, operational inefficiencies, damage to our reputation or our employee and business relationships, and/or subject us to costs, fines, or lawsuits.Our business is heavily supported by operational systems to process large amounts of data and support complex transactions.  If significant financial, operational, or other data processing systems fail, experience actual or attempted cyber-attacks or have other significant shortcomings, our financial results could be adversely affected.  Our financial results could also be adversely affected if an employee causes our operational systems to fail, either as a result of inadvertent error or by deliberately tampering with or manipulating our financial or operational systems. Third-parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to customer or supplier data or our internal data, including intellectual property, financial, and other confidential business information.  Due to increased technology advances, we are more reliant on technologies to support our operations.  We use computer software and programs to run our financial and operational information, and this may subject our business to increased risks.  Cyber-attacks are an ever-increasing risk to companies. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools, third-party service providers and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential information and data. While we have security measures in place, our systems, networks, and third-party service providers have been and will continue to be subject to ongoing threats. We believe our mitigation measures reduce but cannot eliminate the risk of a cyber incident; however, there can be no assurance that our existing and planned precautions of backup systems, regular data backups, security protocols and other procedures will be adequate to prevent significant damage, system failure or data loss and the same is true for our suppliers and other third parties on which we rely.  Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative or mitigating measures. We and our third-party service providers have experienced and expect to continue to experience actual or attempted cyber-attacks of our information systems or networks; however, none of these actual or attempted cyber-attacks had a material impact on our operations or financial condition. Any significant cyber security attacks that affect our facilities, our customers, our key suppliers, or material financial data could have a material adverse effect on our business.  In addition, cyber-attacks on our customers, suppliers and employee data may result in a financial loss, including potential fines for failure to safeguard data, and may negatively impact our reputation.  Third-party systems on which we rely could also suffer operational system failures or cyber-attacks.  An unauthorized disclosure or use of information could cause interruptions in our operations and might require us to spend significant management time and other resources investigating the event and dealing with local and federal law enforcement. 11Table of ContentsOccurrences of any of the events discussed above could disrupt our business, result in potential liability or reputational damage or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.If we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, we may lose some of our competitive advantage. We possess intellectual property, which is instrumental in our ability to compete and grow our business.  If our intellectual property rights are not adequately protected, we could lose our competitive advantage.  We rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks and trade secret protection and contractual rights to establish and protect our intellectual property.  Failure of our copyrights, trademarks and trade secret protection, non-disclosure agreements and other measures to provide protection of our technologies and our intellectual property rights could enable our competitors to more effectively compete with us and could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  In addition, our trade secrets and proprietary know-how may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by others.  No guarantee can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent or superior proprietary information or manufacturing and service know-how and techniques, or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology.Defects in the solutions we provide could increase our cost of quality and could result in consequential damage claims. Our business exposes us to potential liability risks that are inherent in the manufacture and sale of our solutions.  We provide assurance-type warranties for our coil coating solutions.  Widespread manufacturing defects and quality system failures could result in significant losses due to the costs of containment, the destruction of customer-owned inventory, consequential damages and lost sales due to the unavailability of a solution for a period of time.  We may not be able to obtain indemnity or reimbursement from our suppliers or other third parties for the costs or liabilities associated with our suppliers' products.  A significant warranty claim could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our business reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our solutions or offerings all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations.Risks Related to StrategyOur acquisition strategy involves a number of risks.We intend to pursue continued growth through acquiring the assets of target companies that will enable us to (i) expand our product and service offerings and (ii) increase our geographic footprint.  We routinely review potential acquisitions.  However, we may be unable to implement this growth strategy if we are not able to reach agreement on mutually acceptable terms to complete the acquisition.  Moreover, our acquisition strategy involves certain risks, including: •risks and liabilities from our acquisitions that may not be discovered during the pre-acquisition due diligence process;•difficulties in the post-acquisition integration of operations and systems;•the termination of relationships with key personnel and customers of the acquired company;•the potential failure to add additional employees to manage the increased volume of business;•additional post-acquisition challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, financial reporting and legal compliance;•a disruption of our ongoing business or an inability of our ongoing business to receive sufficient management attention; •a failure to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated prior to acquisition;•expansion through acquisition may expose us to new business, regulatory, political, operational, financial, and economic risks associated with such expansion, both inside and outside of the U.S.; and•counterparties to the transaction may fail to perform.Future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available to us, and may increase our leverage ratios.We may be unsuccessful at implementing and generating internal growth from our strategic growth initiatives.Our ability to generate internal growth will be affected by, among other factors, our ability to: •attract new customers, internationally and domestically;•integrate regulatory changes;•increase the number or size of projects performed for existing customers;•hire and retain employees:•complete construction projects in a timely manner; and12Table of Contents•increase volume utilizing existing facilities.Many of the factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth through our initiatives may be beyond our control, and we cannot be certain that our strategies will be successful or that we will be able to generate cash flow sufficient to fund our operations and to support internal growth.  If we are unsuccessful, we may not be able to achieve internal growth, expand our operations or grow our business.The departure of key personnel could disrupt our business.We depend on the continued efforts of our executive officers and senior management team.  We cannot be certain that any individual will continue in such capacity for any particular period of time.  The future loss of key personnel, or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees, could negatively impact our ability to manage our business, which could disrupt our operations or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business.Risks Related to Legal Liability, Taxes, and Regulations  Actual and potential claims, lawsuits, and proceedings could ultimately reduce our profitability and liquidity and negatively impact our financial condition.  The Company could be named as a defendant in legal proceedings claiming damages from us in connection with the operation of our business.  Most actions filed against our Company typically arise out of the normal course of business related to commercial disputes regarding equipment we manufacture or services we provide.  We could potentially be a plaintiff in legal proceedings against our customers, in which we seek to recover payments of contractual amounts we believe are due to us, and indemnity claims for increased costs or damages incurred by our Company.  Under applicable accounting literature, and when appropriate, we establish financial provisions for certain legal exposures meeting the criteria of being both probable and reasonably estimable. Where material, we may adjust any such financial provisions from time to time depending on developments related to each case.  If our assumptions and estimates related to such exposures prove to be inadequate or incorrect, or we have material adverse claims or lawsuits, such events could harm our business reputation, divert management resources away from operating our business, and result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.Changes to U.S. trade policy, tariff and import/export regulations and foreign government regulations could adversely affect our business, operating results, foreign operations, sourcing of materials and financial condition.Changes in U.S. or international social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories or countries where we currently manufacture, distribute and/or sell our manufactured solutions or conduct our business, as well as any negative sentiment toward the U.S. as a result of such changes, could adversely affect our business.  New tariffs, changes in existing tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy have the potential to adversely impact the economies in which we operate or certain sectors thereof, our industry and the demand for our manufactured solutions, and as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Our business is also subject to risks associated with U.S. and foreign legislation and regulations relating to imports, including quotas, duties, tariffs or taxes, and other charges or restrictions on imports, which could adversely affect our operations and our ability to import or export manufactured solutions at current or increased levels, and substantially all of our import operations are subject to customs duties on imported manufactured solutions imposed by the governments where our production facilities are located, including raw materials.  We cannot predict whether additional U.S. and foreign customs quotas, duties (including antidumping or countervailing duties), tariffs, taxes or other charges or restrictions, requirements as to where raw materials must be purchased, reporting obligations pertaining to ""conflict minerals"" mined from certain countries, additional workplace regulations, or other restrictions on our imports will be imposed upon the importation or exportation of our manufactured solutions in the future or adversely modified, or what effect such actions would have on our costs of operations.  Future quotas, duties, or tariffs may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  Future trade agreements could also provide our competitors with an advantage over us, or increase our costs, either of which could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Regulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business.Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, which established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for publicly-traded companies that use tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold (collectively, ""conflict minerals"") mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in their manufactured solutions, we are subject to certain annual disclosures and audit requirements.  There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including costs for due diligence 13Table of Contentsto determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our manufactured solutions and other potential changes to manufactured solutions, processes, or sources of supply.  Despite our continued due diligence efforts, in the future we may be unable to verify the origin of all conflict minerals used in our component products.  As a result, we could potentially face reputational and other challenges with our customers that require that all of the components incorporated in our manufactured solutions be certified as conflict-free.Adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations could make it easier for our employees to obtain union representation and our business could be adversely impacted.As of February 29, 2024, 624 (or 16.1%) of our full-time employees were represented by unions under collective bargaining agreements.  Our U.S.-based employees have the right at any time under the National Labor Relations Act to form or affiliate with a union.  If a large portion of our U.S. workforce were to become unionized and the terms of the collective bargaining agreement were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements, it could increase our operating costs and adversely impact our profitability.  Any changes in regulations, the imposition of new regulations, or the enactment of new legislation could have an adverse impact on our business to the extent it becomes easier for workers to obtain union representation.Changes in labor or employment laws, including minimum wage rules, could increase our costs and may adversely affect our business.Various federal, state and international labor and employment laws govern our relationship with employees and affect operating costs.  These laws include minimum wage requirements, overtime, unemployment tax rates, workers’ compensation rates, leaves of absence, mandated health and other benefits, and citizenship requirements.  Significant additional government-imposed increases or new requirements in these areas could materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows.Risks Related to Environmental ConditionsClimate change could impact our business. Climate change could present risks to our future operations from severe weather events and other natural conditions, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, wildfires, droughts or flooding.  Consequences of such extreme weather conditions could include physical risks to our facilities, supply chain disruptions, increased operational costs, as well as the price and/or availability of insurance coverage for Company assets.  We cannot predict the potential timing or impact from potential global warming, winter storms and other severe weather events and other natural conditions.  We carry certain limits of insurance to mitigate the potential effects of events that could impact our businesses, as well as disaster recovery plans related to any potential severe weather events and other natural conditions that might occur within regions in which we have operations, or at any of the Company locations. Changes in environmental laws and regulations and heightened focus on corporate sustainability initiatives and practices are under increased scrutiny by both governmental and non-governmental bodies, which could cause a change in our business practices by increasing capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs, which could impact our future operating results.Over the past several years, there has been a heightened focus by both governmental and non-governmental bodies requesting disclosure of information relating to corporate sustainability practices as well as an increase in customers' preference to source from suppliers who have implemented effective sustainability initiatives.  International agreements, national and regional legislation, and regulatory measures to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions and require companies to more efficiently use energy, water and reduce waste, are in various stages of discussion and/or implementation across the globe.  These laws, regulations and policies, as well as other sustainability demands made by governmental and non-governmental bodies may result in the need for future capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs.  We cannot predict the level of expenditures or potential impact to the Company that may be required to comply with these evolving environmental and sustainability laws and regulations due to the uncertainties on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction in which we operate, and our activities in each one of these jurisdictions.The financial impact of the heightened focus on sustainability practices for all companies to increase efficiencies in consumption of resources and regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions will depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to:•the sectors covered;•future permitted levels for greenhouse gas emissions;14Table of Contents•the extent to which we would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to invest in additional compliance equipment or compliance instruments, either on the open market or through auctions; •the price and availability of emission allowances and credits; and •the impact of legislation or other regulation on our ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of our manufactured solutions.Our operations could be adversely impacted by the effects of future changes to the law and government regulations regarding emissions, the environment and other sustainability matters.Various regulations have been implemented regarding emissions, the environment and other sustainability matters.  We cannot predict future changes in the law and government regulations regarding emissions, the environment and other sustainability matters, or what actions may be taken by our customers or other industry participants in response to any future legislation.  While the Company actively is engaged in enhancing our environmental, social and governance programs, changes in laws or governmental regulations could negatively impact our business or the demand for our manufactured solutions by customers, other industry related participants, or our investors, and could result in a negative impact to our operations, profitability, or our ability to perform projects in the future.Risks Related to Financial Matters and Our Capital StructureThe Company’s flexibility to operate its business could be impacted by provisions in its debt obligations.The Company’s debt instruments, consisting of a term loan and a revolving credit facility, contain covenants which restrict or prohibit certain actions (""negative covenants""), including, but not limited to, the Company's ability to incur debt, restrict or limit certain liens, capital spending limits, engage in certain merger, acquisition, or divestiture actions, or increase dividends beyond a specific level.  The Company’s debt instruments also contain covenants requiring the Company to, among other things, maintain specified financial ratios (""affirmative covenants"").  Failure to comply with these negative covenants and affirmative covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could restrict the Company’s access to liquidity and have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business or prospects.  If the Company does not have enough cash to service its debt or fund other liquidity needs, the Company may be required to take actions such as requesting a waiver from lenders, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing all or part of the existing debt, or seeking additional equity capital.  The Company cannot assure that any of these remedies can be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all.Our indebtedness and restrictive debt covenants could materially adversely affect our financial condition, our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, our ability to operate our business, our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, our ability to meet our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments.Our consolidated indebtedness increased substantially following the completion of the acquisition of Precoat Metals (""Precoat Acquisition"") in May 2022.  This increased level of indebtedness could adversely affect us, including by decreasing our business flexibility.  Our Credit Agreement contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These covenants may limit our ability to optimally operate our business. In addition, our Credit Agreement requires that we meet certain financial tests, including a leverage ratio test.  Our increased indebtedness and these restrictive covenants could adversely affect our ability to:•finance our operations;•make needed capital expenditures;•make strategic acquisitions or investments or enter into joint ventures;•withstand a future downturn in our business, the industry or the economy in general;•engage in business activities, including future opportunities, that may be in our best interest; and•plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies.The covenant restrictions related to our indebtedness could impact our ability to expand our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result of these restrictions, we could be limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.  The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants. Our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above and/or the terms of any future indebtedness from time to time could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay 15Table of Contentsthese borrowings before their due date and the termination of future funding commitments by our lenders.  During fiscal 2024, we successfully refinanced our long-term debt to lower interest rates; however, if we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or cannot refinance these borrowings in the future, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. The Credit Agreement contains cross-default provisions that could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness. A breach of the covenants under our Credit Agreement could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness to which cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under the Credit Agreement would permit the lenders under the Credit Agreement to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay amounts due and payable under the Credit Agreement, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the event our lenders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our guarantors may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. Additionally, we may not be able to borrow money from other lenders to enable us to refinance our indebtedness.  Increased levels of indebtedness could also create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels. Our investment in the AVAIL Joint Venture could be materially and adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority over the majority of the strategic and operational decisions of the business, corporate governance matters, and our reliance on our AVAIL Joint Venture partner's financial condition. On September 30, 2022, we completed a disposition of 60% of the equity of AIS Investment Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the ""AVAIL JV""), which consists of our former AZZ Infrastructure Solutions Segment (excluding AZZ Crowley Tubing) (the ""AIS Business""), with Fernweh AIS Acquisition LP, a Delaware limited partnership. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, AZZ no longer has a controlling interest in the AVAIL JV, and therefore the AVAIL JV is operating and will continue to operate independently.  As the non-controlling interest holder in the AVAIL JV, our influence on all aspects of the AIS Business will continue to diminish.  Accordingly, we might not be able to prevent the AVAIL JV from taking actions adverse to our interests in the AVAIL JV.  We cannot exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the AIS Business, including, but not limited to, hiring and retaining employees and executive officers, management of and payments into its multiemployer pension plans, governance issues, entering into new markets or exiting existing markets, making certain acquisitions or dispositions, and other material strategic transactions, which in each case could create the potential risk of creating operational issues and/or impasses on decisions or decisions at the AVAIL JV-level not in our best interest.  Additionally, investments in joint ventures or partnerships, such as the AVAIL JV, may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present when a third-party is not involved, including the possibility that joint venture partners may become bankrupt, fail to fund their share of required capital contributions to various parties, or otherwise struggle operationally or financially.  Disputes between AZZ Inc, and our joint venture partner could result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expense and distract our executive officers and directors from focusing their time and efforts on AZZ Inc.'s business and could result in subjecting the AIS Business to additional risk. Any of the foregoing operational risks could materially reduce the expected return of our prior investment in the AVAIL JV and materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and the trading price of our securities. Adverse changes in the value of assets or obligations associated with our defined benefit pension plan could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.We have a defined benefit pension plan which is frozen with respect to benefits and the addition of participants. The funded status and our ability to satisfy the future obligations of the plan is affected by, among other things, changes in interest rates, returns from plan asset investments, and actuarial assumptions including the life expectancies of the plan’s participants. As of February 29, 2024, the plan was underfunded, and we have a liability of $31.1 million on our consolidated balance sheet.  Our ability to adequately fund or meet our future obligations with respect to the plan could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.  A change in a customer’s creditworthiness could result in significant accounts receivable write-offs.As a normal course of business, we extend credit to certain of our customers.  The amount of credit extended to customers is based upon the due diligence performed, including, but not limited to, the review of the potential customer’s financial statements and banking information.  The Company may perform various credit checks and evaluate the customer's previous payment history.  While we do not believe we have significant concentration of sales with any one customer, we have certain larger customers, which could result in a significant amount of credit exposure if there is a sudden or severe change in the customer’s creditworthiness.  We monitor our outstanding receivables on a regular basis; however, if a customer with large 16Table of Contentscredit exposure is unable to make payment on its outstanding receivables, we could experience a significant write-off of accounts receivable, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.If our goodwill, definite-lived intangible assets or other indefinite-lived intangible assets were to become impaired, our net income and results of operations could be negatively affected.Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Indefinite-lived intangibles are comprised of certain trade names.  We test goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life for potential impairment annually, in the fourth quarter, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of the goodwill below its carrying amount.  Factors that could indicate that our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, lower than projected operating results and cash flows and economic downturns or slower growth rates in our industry, market downturns or major events like a global pandemic.  Our stock price historically has shown volatility and often fluctuates significantly in response to market and other factors.  Declines in our stock price, lower operating results and any decline in industry conditions in the future could increase the risk of impairment.  The evaluation for impairment includes our estimates of future operating results and cash flows, estimates of allocations of certain assets and cash flows among reporting segments, estimates of future growth rates, and our judgment regarding the applicable discount rates used on estimated operating results and cash flows.Intangible assets on the consolidated balance sheets are comprised of customer relationships, non-compete agreements, trademarks, technology and certifications. Intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by a comparison of their carrying amount to the estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated by those assets. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount, we record impairment losses for the excess of their carrying value over the estimated fair value.Should a review indicate impairment, a write-down of the carrying value of the goodwill or intangible asset would occur, resulting in a non-cash charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements, impact our credibility with our shareholders, or impact our relationships with our customers, suppliers or supporting banks. We are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations in the international markets in which we operate.We operate in the United States and Canada and anticipate that there will be instances in which sales and costs will not be exactly matched with respect to foreign currency denomination.  Gains and losses from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities that are receivable or payable in currencies other than our subsidiaries’ functional currency are included in our consolidated statements of income.  In addition, currency fluctuations cause the U.S. dollar value of our Canadian results of operations and net assets to vary with exchange rate fluctuations.  A decrease in the value of the Canadian currency relative to the U.S. dollar could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. As we continue to expand geographically, we could experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings or net assets solely as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.Our operations entail inherent risks that may result in substantial liability.  We do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities.Our manufacturing processes and services provided to our customers entail inherent risks, including defects.  The insurance we carry to mitigate many of these risks may not be adequate to cover future claims or losses.  In addition, we are substantially self-insured for workers’ compensation, employer’s liability, property, general liability and employee group health claims in view of the relatively high per-incident deductibles we absorb under our insurance arrangements for these risks.  Further, insurance covering the risks we expect to face or in the amounts we desire may not be available in the future or, if available, the premiums may not be commercially justifiable.  If we were to incur substantial liability and such damages were not covered by insurance or were in excess of policy limits, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.Tax legislation and administrative initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We operate in locations throughout the U.S. and Canada and, as a result, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of U.S. federal, state, and local governments and the Canadian government. From time to time, various legislative or administrative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions.  In addition, U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations.  Moreover, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving any future tax disputes favorably more difficult. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be 17Table of Contentssuccessful in any such challenge.  Changes to our tax positions resulting from future tax legislation and administrative initiatives or challenges from taxing authorities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.The insurance coverage that we maintain may not fully cover all operational risks.We maintain property, business interruption, casualty and cyber/information security insurance but such insurance may not cover all of the risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered. We may incur losses beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of our insurance policies, including liabilities for environmental remediation. In the future, the types of insurance we obtain and the level of coverage we maintain may be inadequate or we may be unable to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost.The Series A Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference and redemption amount significantly in excess of the carrying amount of the Series A Preferred Stock. The 6.0% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred Stock”) has a liquidation preference equal to the greater of (i) the aggregate principal amount of $240.0 million (the “Series A Base Amount”) plus accrued but unpaid dividends and (ii) the amount that would have been received had the shares of Series A Preferred Stock been converted immediately prior to liquidation (or other event giving rise to the payment). As of February 29, 2024, the holders of the shares of Series A preferred stock were entitled to a liquidation preference of approximately $312.5 million, in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company as of such year end.  If the Company undergoes a change of control, bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or de-listing of the Company’s common stock (a “Fundamental Change Event”), holders of Series A Preferred Stock may elect to (i) receive the as-converted value of the Company’s common stock at the then-current Conversion Price, (ii) require the Company to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock in cash for the Redemption Amount (as defined below) or (iii) if a non-cash change of control, retain their shares of Series A Preferred Stock.The Company will have the right to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock at a price equal to the greater of (i) the Series A Base Amount plus accrued but unpaid dividends; (ii) the initial Series A Base Amount (excluding any prior PIK dividends) multiplied by the Return Factor less all dividends paid through the redemption date; or (iii) the amount the holder of such share of convertible preferred stock would have received had such holder, immediately prior to such redemption date, converted such shares of convertible preferred stock into common shares (such greater amount, the “Redemption Amount”).  The redemption price under option (ii) contains a ""Return Factor,"" which will be equal to 1.4 until May 13, 2024  and, (a) in each of the three years thereafter, will increase by 0.15, (b) will increase by an additional 0.15 after May 13, 2024 (the second anniversary of the issuance date of the Series A Preferred Stock) if (i) the Company’s ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) (as defined in the May 13, 2022 Credit Agreement) on the second anniversary of the issuance date of the Series A Preferred Stock is greater than 3.5-to-1 and (ii) prior to May 13, 2024, the Company has not consummated dispositions of assets that, in the aggregate, resulted in proceeds in excess of $200.0 million and (c) will increase by an additional 0.20 on May 13, 2028, (the sixth anniversary of the issuance date of the Series A Preferred Stock) and each anniversary thereafter.  The redemption price under option (iii) is subject to provisions of the Certificate of Designation that limits the Company’s right to redeem to the period following the two year anniversary of the initial issuance, limits the quarterly conversion to up to 25% of the number of shares of convertible preferred stock outstanding, and requires the Company’s market price per share of common stock to exceed 185% of the conversion price.As of February 29, 2024, the Redemption Amount for the Series A Preferred stock was $312.5 million.  Should the Company exercise its right to redeem the Series A Preferred stock, net income and net income per share available to common shareholders would be reduced, as the excess of the Redemption Amount over the carrying value of the Series A Preferred Stock would be paid to the Series A Preferred stockholders as an additional dividend, which would result in decreased net income available to common stockholders and earnings per share.Shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of our Series A Preferred Stock will be dilutive to our existing shareholders upon conversion and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.As of February 29, 2024, we had outstanding 240,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately $312.5 million. As of February 29, 2024, shares of Series A Preferred Stock are convertible into 4.1 million shares of common stock. The issuance of common stock upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock would result in immediate dilution to existing holders of our common stock. 18Table of ContentsFurther, the Series A Preferred Stock ranks senior to our common stock, which could affect the value of the common stock on liquidation or on a change in control transaction. Blackstone may sell shares of our common stock in the public market, which may cause the market price of our common stock to decrease, and therefore make it more difficult to raise equity financing or issue equity as consideration in an acquisition.Our registration rights agreement with Blackstone requires us to register all shares of common stock held by Blackstone and its permitted transferees issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock under the Securities Act, which we completed on November 4, 2022. The registration rights for Blackstone allow Blackstone to sell its shares without compliance with the volume and manner of sale limitations under Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, and facilitates the resale of such securities into the public market. The market value of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by Blackstone from time to time. In particular, the future sale of a substantial number of the shares of our common stock by Blackstone within a short period of time, or the perception that such sale might occur, could cause our stock price to decrease, make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of our common stock or acquire other businesses in the future using our common stock as consideration for the purchase price.Interest Rate RiskAn increase in interest rates would increase interest costs on variable-rate debt and could adversely impact the ability to refinance existing debt. As of February 29, 2024, we have $1.0 billion of gross debt outstanding that bears interest at variable rates that reset periodically and are generally based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR"") or Base Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement. We utilize interest rate swaps to mitigate the interest rate risk, and we have hedged approximately one-half of our gross debt outstanding. However, approximately one-half of our gross debt outstanding is unhedged. If interest rates increase, so will our interest costs, which could adversely affect cash flow and the ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and the ability to make distributions to shareholders. In addition, rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures. An increase in interest rates could also affect our ability to make new investments on favorable terms or at all.We may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future, which could affect our financial condition, may decrease our profitability or could dilute our shareholders.We may increase our debt or raise additional equity capital in the future, subject to restrictions in our debt agreements, whether in a private offering or pursuant to our effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which we filed on January 10, 2024. If our cash flow from operations is less than we anticipate, or if our cash requirements are more than we expect, we may require more financing. However, debt or equity financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of additional shares of common stock or other equity-linked securities, the terms of the debt or any shares of common stock or other equity-linked securities issued may give the holders rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, particularly in the event of liquidation. The terms of any new debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have. If we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity, our current shareholders’ ownership in the Company would be diluted. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, it could affect our financial flexibility, which could negatively affect our shareholders.General Risks FactorsThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.The market price of our stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:•the inability to meet the financial estimates of analysts who follow our common stock;•investor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our Company relative to other investment alternatives;•strategic actions by us or our competitors;•announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;•variations in our quarterly operating results and those of our competitors;•general economic and stock market conditions;19Table of Contents•risks relating to our business and our industry, including those discussed above;•changes in conditions or trends in our industry, markets or customers;•cyber-attacks, terrorist acts or armed hostilities;•future sales of our common stock or other securities;•repurchases of our outstanding shares; and•material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance"
6,AZZ,AZZ INC,2023-04-25,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
Our business is subject to a variety of risks, including, but not limited to, the risks described below, which we believe are the most significant risks and uncertainties facing our business.  Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or not described below may also impair our business operations in the future.  If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations and future growth could be negatively or materially impacted.Risks Related to OperationsOur business segments operate in highly competitive markets.Competition is based on a number of factors, including price. Certain competitors may have lower cost structures or larger economies of scale on raw materials and may, therefore, be able to provide their products and services at lower prices than we are able to provide.  If our response to competitor pricing actions is not timely, we could be impacted by loss of market share.  We cannot be certain that our competitors will not develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services or products that are superior in price, delivery time or quality in the future.  Similarly, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position within our industries, maintain our customer base at current levels or increase our customer base.Our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.Our quarterly results may be materially and adversely affected by: •changes in political landscapes across the globe;•unstable political economic conditions and public health issues delaying customer operations;•timing and volume of work under new or existing agreements;•general economic conditions;•fluctuations in the budgetary spending of customers, including seasonality;•increases in manufacturing or transportation costs;•variations in margins, due to sales price or manufacturing complexities, of projects performed during any particular quarter;•losses experienced in our operations not otherwise covered by insurance; •delays of raw materials or component suppliers;•a change in the demand or production of our products and our services caused by severe weather conditions;•a change in the mix of our customers, contracts and business;•modifications or changes in customer delivery schedules;•ability or willingness of customers to timely pay their invoices when owed to us; and9Table of Contents•changes in interest rates.Accordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results expected for any other quarter or for the entire year.Our business requires skilled labor, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees.Our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability could be limited by an inability to employ, train and retain skilled personnel necessary to meet our labor requirements.  We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an adequately skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy or that our labor costs will not increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel.  Labor shortages or increased labor-related costs could impair our ability to maintain our profit margins or impact our ability to sustain and grow our sales.Technological innovations by competitors may make existing products and production methods obsolete.The manufactured products and services we sell require evolving technologies for success in the markets we serve.  The competitive environments can be highly sensitive to technological innovation.  It is possible for our competitors, or new market place entrants, both foreign and domestic, to develop new products, production methods or technology which could make existing products, services or methods obsolete or at least hasten their obsolescence or materially reduce our competitive advantage in the markets that we serve.Our business segments are cyclical and are sensitive to economic downturns.Our business often aligns with the economic environments that we operate within, and, especially in our Precoat Metals segment, is subject to seasonality within the annual operating cycle of the business.  Our customers may delay or cancel new or previously planned projects.  If there is a downturn in the general economies in which we operate, there could be a material adverse effect on price levels and the quantity of goods and services purchased by our customers, which could adversely impact our sales, consolidated results from operations and cash flows.  A number of factors, including financing conditions and potential bankruptcies in the industries we serve, could adversely affect our customers and their ability or willingness to fund their internal projects in the future and pay for services or equipment.  Certain economic conditions may also impact the financial condition of one or more of our key suppliers, which could affect our ability to secure raw materials and components to meet our customers’ demand for our products in the future.  Other various factors impact demand for our products and services, including the price of commodities (such as zinc, natural gas or other commodities), paint, economic forecasts and financial markets.  Uncertainty in the global economy and financial markets could impact our customers and could, in turn, severely impact the demand for corporate infrastructure projects that would result in a reduction in orders for our products and services.  All of these factors combined together could materially impact our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and potentially impact the trading price of our common stock.International events and political issues may adversely affect our AZZ Metal Coatings segments.A portion of the sales from our AZZ Metal Coatings and AZZ Infrastructure Solutions segments are from markets outside the U.S.  The occurrence of any of the risks described below could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition: •political and economic instability in the country, Canada, we conduct business;•social unrest, acts of war and terrorism, natural disasters, and global outbreaks of contagious diseases;•inflation, or hyper-inflation;•significant currency fluctuations, currency devaluations or restrictions on currency conversions;•governmental activities that limit or disrupt markets, restrict payments or limit the movement of funds;•trade restrictions, tariffs and economic embargoes by the United States or other countries; and•travel restrictions placed upon personnel.Catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.The occurrence of catastrophic events ranging from acts of war and terrorism, natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, or the outbreaks of epidemic, pandemic or contagious diseases could potentially cause future disruption in our business.  At this time, the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has not materially impacted our operations.  Any disruption of our customers or suppliers and their respective contract manufacturers could likely impact our future sales and operating results.  In addition, the spread of contagious diseases, could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, and result in an economic downturn that could affect the demand for our products and services.  These 10Table of Contentssituations are outside of the Company’s control and any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.Fluctuations in the price and supply of raw materials and natural gas for our business segments may adversely affect our operations.Within our AZZ Metal Coatings segment, zinc and natural gas represent a large portion of our cost of sales.  In our AZZ Precoat Metals segment, natural gas represents a large portion of our cost of sales.  The prices of zinc and natural gas are subject to volatility and we have experienced commodity price escalation over the past year.  Unanticipated commodity price increases could significantly increase production costs and potentially adversely affect profitability.  The following factors, which are beyond our control, affect the price of natural gas for the AZZ Metal Coatings segment: •supply and demand; •freight costs and transportation availability; •trade duties and taxes; and •labor disputes. We seek to maintain our operating margins by increasing the price of our products and services in response to increased costs, but may not be successful in passing these increased costs of operation through to our customers.A failure in our operational information systems or cyber security attacks on any of our facilities, or those of third parties, may adversely affect our financial results.Our business is heavily supported by operational systems to process large amounts of data and support complex transactions.  If significant financial, operational, or other data processing systems fail, are attacked by intruders or have other significant shortcomings, our financial results could be adversely affected.  Our financial results could also be adversely affected if an employee causes our operational systems to fail, either as a result of inadvertent error or by deliberately tampering with or manipulating our financial or operational systems.  Due to increased technology advances, we are more reliant on technologies to support our operations.  We use computer software and programs to run our financial and operational information, and this may subject our business to increased risks.  Cyber-attacks are an ever-increasing risk to companies. Any significant cyber security attacks that affect our facilities, our customers, our key suppliers, or material financial data could have a material adverse effect on our business.  In addition, cyber-attacks on our customers, suppliers and employee data may result in a financial loss, including potential fines for failure to safeguard data, and may negatively impact our reputation.  Third-party systems on which we rely could also suffer operational system failure.  Any of these occurrences could disrupt our business, result in potential liability or reputational damage or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial results.If we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, we may lose some of our competitive advantage. We possess intellectual property, which is instrumental in our ability to compete and grow our business.  If our intellectual property rights are not adequately protected, we could lose our competitive advantage.  There can be no assurance that our patent applications will result in patents being issued or that current or additional patents will afford protection against competitors.  We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret protection and contractual rights to establish and protect our intellectual property.  Failure of our patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret protection, non-disclosure agreements and other measures to provide protection of our technology and our intellectual property rights could enable our competitors to more effectively compete with us and could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, our trade secrets and proprietary know-how may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by others.  No guarantee can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or manufacturing and service know-how and techniques, or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology.Product defects could increase our warranty costs and could result in product liability claims.Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of our products and the products of third-party vendors which we use or resell.  Widespread product recalls could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, penalties, and lost sales due to the unavailability of a product for a period of time. We may also be liable if the use of any of our products causes harm and could suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us in excess of its insurance limits.  We may not be able to obtain indemnity or reimbursement from our suppliers or other third parties for the warranty costs or liabilities associated with our supplier products.  A significant product recall, warranty claim, or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our business reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our products.11Table of ContentsRisks Related to StrategyOur acquisition strategy involves a number of risks.We intend to pursue continued growth through acquiring the assets of target companies that will enable us to (i) expand our product and service offerings and (ii) increase our geographic footprint.  We routinely review potential acquisitions.  However, we may be unable to implement this growth strategy if we are not able to reach agreement on mutually acceptable terms.  Moreover, our acquisition strategy involves certain risks, including: •risks and liabilities from our acquisitions that may not be discovered during the pre-acquisition due diligence process;•difficulties in the post-acquisition integration of operations and systems;•the termination of relationships with key personnel and customers of the acquired company;•the potential failure to add additional employees to manage the increased volume of business;•additional post-acquisition challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, financial reporting and legal compliance;•a disruption of our ongoing business or an inability of our ongoing business to receive sufficient management attention; and•a failure to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated prior to acquisition.Future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available to us, and may increase our leverage ratios.We may be unsuccessful at implementing and generating internal growth from our Strategic Growth Initiatives.Our ability to generate internal growth will be affected by, among other factors, our ability to: •attract new customers, internationally and domestically;•integrate regulatory changes;•increase the number or size of projects performed for existing customers;•hire and retain employees; and•increase volume utilizing existing facilities.Many of the factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth through our initiatives may be beyond our control, and we cannot be certain that our strategies will be successful or that we will be able to generate cash flow sufficient to fund our operations and to support internal growth.  If we are unsuccessful, we may not be able to achieve internal growth, expand our operations or grow our business.The departure of key personnel could disrupt our business.We depend on the continued efforts of our executive officers and senior management team.  We cannot be certain that any individual will continue in such capacity for any particular period of time.  The future loss of key personnel, or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees, could negatively impact our ability to manage our business.Risks Related to Legal Liability and Regulations Actual and potential claims, lawsuits, and proceedings could ultimately reduce our profitability and liquidity and negatively impact our financial condition.The Company could be named as a defendant in legal proceedings claiming damages from us in connection with the operation of our business.  Most actions filed against our Company typically arise out of the normal course of business related to commercial disputes regarding equipment we manufacture or services we provide.  We could potentially be a plaintiff in legal proceedings against our customers, in which we seek to recover payments of contractual amounts we believe are due to us, and indemnity claims for increased costs or damages incurred by our Company.  Under applicable accounting literature, and when appropriate, we establish financial provisions for certain legal exposures meeting the criteria of being both probable and reasonably estimable. Where material, we may adjust any such financial provisions from time to time depending on developments related to each case.  If our assumptions and estimates related to such exposures prove to be inadequate or incorrect, or we have material adverse claims or lawsuits, they could harm our business reputation, divert management resources away from operating our business, and result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.12Table of ContentsOur operations could be adversely impacted by the effects of future changes to the law and government regulations regarding emissions, the global environment and other sustainability matters.Various regulations have been implemented regarding emissions, the global environment and other sustainability matters.  We cannot predict future changes in the law and government regulations regarding emissions, the global environment and other sustainability matters, or what actions may be taken by our customers or other industry participants in response to any future legislation.  While the Company actively is engaged in building our environmental, social and governance programs, changes in laws or governmental regulations could negatively impact our business or the demand for our products and services by customers, other industry related participants, or our investors, and could result in a negative impact to our operations, profitability, or our ability to perform projects in the future.Changes to U.S. trade policy, tariff and import/export regulations and foreign government regulations could adversely affect our business, operating results, foreign operations, sourcing and financial condition.Changes in U.S. or international social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories or countries where we currently manufacture, distribute and/or sell our products or conduct our business, as well as any negative sentiment toward the U.S. as a result of such changes, could adversely affect our business.  New tariffs, changes in existing tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy have the potential to adversely impact the economies in which we operate or certain sectors thereof, our industry and the global demand for our products, and as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.  In addition, we cannot predict the full impact trade policy changes that have been asserted by the U.S. presidential administration and Congress, including anticipated changes to current trade policies will be maintained or modified or whether the entry into new bilateral or multilateral trade agreements will occur, nor can we accurately predict the effects that any changes will have on our future business.Our business is also subject to risks associated with U.S. and foreign legislation and regulations relating to imports, including quotas, duties, tariffs or taxes, and other charges or restrictions on imports, which could adversely affect our operations and our ability to import or export products at current or increased levels, and substantially all of our import operations are subject to customs duties on imported products imposed by the governments where our production facilities are located, including raw materials.  We cannot predict whether additional U.S. and foreign customs quotas, duties (including antidumping or countervailing duties), tariffs, taxes or other charges or restrictions, requirements as to where raw materials must be purchased, reporting obligations pertaining to ""conflict minerals"" mined from certain countries, additional workplace regulations, or other restrictions on our imports will be imposed upon the importation or exportation of our products in the future or adversely modified, or what effect such actions would have on our costs of operations.  Future quotas, duties, or tariffs may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  Future trade agreements could also provide our competitors with an advantage over us, or increase our costs, either of which could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Regulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business.Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, which established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for publicly-traded companies that use tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold (collectively, ""conflict minerals"") mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in their products, we are subject to certain annual disclosures and audit requirements.  There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including costs for due diligence to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes, or sources of supply.  Despite our continued due diligence efforts, in the future we may be unable to verify the origin of all conflict minerals used in our component products.  As a result, we could potentially face reputational and other challenges with our customers that require that all of the components incorporated in our products be certified as conflict-free.Adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations could make it easier for our employees to obtain union representation and our business could be adversely impacted.As of February 28, 2023, approximately 668 of our full-time employees were represented by unions.  Our U.S.-based employees have the right at any time under the National Labor Relations Act to form or affiliate with a union.  If a large portion of our workforce were to become unionized and the terms of the collective bargaining agreement were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements, it could increase our operating costs and adversely impact our profitability.  Any changes in regulations, the imposition of new regulations, or the enactment of new legislation could have an adverse impact on our business to the extent it becomes easier for workers to obtain union representation.13Table of ContentsChanges in labor or employment laws, including minimum wage rules, could increase our costs and may adversely affect our business.Various federal, state and international labor and employment laws govern our relationship with employees and affect operating costs.  These laws include minimum wage requirements, overtime, unemployment tax rates, workers’ compensation rates, leaves of absence, mandated health and other benefits, and citizenship requirements.  Significant additional government-imposed increases or new requirements in these areas could materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows.Risks Related to Environmental ConditionsClimate change could impact our business.Climate changes could result in an adverse impact on our operations, particularly in hurricane prone or low-lying areas near the ocean or heavy snowfall and ice regions.  We cannot predict the potential timing or impact from potential global warming, winter storms and other natural disasters.  We carry certain limits of insurance to mitigate the potential effects of events that could impact our businesses, as well as disaster recovery plans related to any potential natural disasters that might occur within regions in which we have operations, or at any of the Company locations.Changes in environmental laws and regulations and heightened focus on corporate sustainability initiatives and practices are under increased scrutiny by both governmental and non-governmental bodies, which could cause a change in our business practices by increasing capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs, which could impact our future operating results.Over the past year there has been a heightened focus by both governmental and non-governmental bodies requesting disclosure of information relating to our corporate sustainable practices as well as customers are increasingly preferring to source from suppliers who have implemented effective sustainability initiatives.  International agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions and require companies to more efficiently use energy, water and reduce waste, are in various stages of discussion and/or implementation across the globe.  These laws, regulations and policies, as well other sustainability demands made by governmental and non-governmental bodies may result in the need for future capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs.  We cannot predict the level of expenditures or potential impact to the Company that may be required to comply with these evolving environmental and sustainability laws and regulations due to the uncertainties on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction in which we operate, and our activities in each one of these jurisdictions.The financial impact of the heightened focus on sustainability practices for all companies to increase efficiencies in consumption of resources and future regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions will depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to:•the sectors covered;•future permitted levels for greenhouse gas emissions;•the extent to which we would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to invest in additional compliance equipment or compliance instruments, either on the open market or through auctions; •the price and availability of emission allowances and credits; and •the impact of legislation or other regulation on our ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of our products and services.Risks Related to Financial MattersThe Company’s flexibility to operate its business could be impacted by provisions in its debt obligations.The Company’s debt instruments, consisting of a term loan and a revolving credit facility, contain covenants which restrict or prohibit certain actions (""negative covenants""), including, but not limited to, the Company's ability to incur debt, restrict or limit certain liens, capital spending limits, engage in certain merger, acquisition, or divestiture actions, or increase dividends beyond a specific level.  The Company’s debt instruments also contain covenants requiring the Company to, among other things, maintain specified financial ratios (""affirmative covenants"").  Failure to comply with these negative covenants and affirmative covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could restrict the Company’s access to liquidity and have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business or prospects.  If the Company does not have enough cash to service its debt or fund other liquidity needs, the Company may be required to take actions such as requesting a waiver from lenders, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing all or part of the existing 14Table of Contentsdebt, or seeking additional equity capital.  The Company cannot assure that any of these remedies can be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all.Our substantial indebtedness and restrictive debt covenants could materially adversely affect our financial condition, our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, our ability to operate our business, our ability to react to changes in he economy or our industry, our ability to meet our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments.Our consolidated indebtedness increased substantially following the completion of the Precoat Acquisition.  This increased level of indebtedness could adversely affect us, including by decreasing our business flexibility.  Our Credit Agreement contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These covenants may limit our ability to optimally operate our business. In addition, our Credit Agreement requires that we meet certain financial tests, including a leverage ratio test.  Our increased indebtedness and these restrictive covenants could adversely affect our ability to:•finance our operations;•make needed capital expenditures;•make strategic acquisitions or investments or enter into joint ventures;•withstand a future downturn in our business, the industry or the economy in general;•engage in business activities, including future opportunities, that may be in our best interest; and•plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies.The covenant restrictions related to our indebtedness could impact our ability to expand our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result of these restrictions, we could be limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.  The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants. Our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above and/or the terms of any future indebtedness from time to time could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date and the termination of future funding commitments by our lenders.  If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or cannot refinance these borrowings, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. The Credit Agreement contains cross-default provisions that could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness. A breach of the covenants under our Credit Agreement could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness to which across-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under the Credit Agreement would permit the lenders under the Credit Agreement to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay amounts due and payable under the Credit Agreement, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the event our lenders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our guarantors may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. Additionally, we may not be able to borrow money from other lenders to enable us to refinance our indebtedness.  Increased levels of indebtedness could also create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels. Our investment in the AIS Joint Venture could be materially and adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority over the majority of the strategic and operational decisions of the business, corporate governance matters, and our reliance on our AIS Joint Venture partner's financial condition. On September 30, 2022, we completed a disposition of 60% of the equity of AIS Investment Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the ""AIS JV""), which consists of our former AZZ Infrastructure Solutions Segment (excluding AZZ Crowley Tubing) (the ""AIS Business""), with Fernweh AIS Acquisition LP, a Delaware limited partnership. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, AZZ no longer has a controlling interest in the AIS JV, and therefore the AIS JV is operating and will continue to operate independently.  As the non-controlling interest holder in the AIS JV, our influence on all aspects of the AIS Business will continue to diminish.  Accordingly, we might not be able to prevent the AIS JV from taking actions adverse to our interests in the AIS JV.  We cannot exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the AIS Business, including, but not limited to, hiring and retaining employees and executive officers, management of and payments into its multiemployer pension plans, governance issues, entering into new markets or exiting existing markets, making certain acquisitions or dispositions, and other material strategic transactions, which in each case could create the potential risk of creating operational issues and/or impasses on decisions or decisions at the AIS JV-level not in our best interest.  Additionally, investments in joint ventures or partnerships, such as the AIS JV, may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present when a third-party is not involved, including the possibility that joint venture partners may become bankrupt, fail to fund their share of required capital contributions to various parties, or otherwise struggle operationally or financially.  Disputes between AZZ Inc, and our joint venture partner could result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expense and distract our 15Table of Contentsexecutive officers and directors from focusing their time and efforts on AZZ Inc.'s business and could result in subjecting the AIS Business to additional risk. Any of the foregoing operational risks could materially reduce the expected return of our prior investment in the AIS JV and materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and the trading price of our securities. Adverse changes in the value of assets or obligations associated with our defined benefit pension plan could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.We have a defined benefit pension plan which is frozen with respect to benefits and the addition of participants. The funded status and our ability to satisfy the future obligations of the plan is affected by, among other things, changes in interest rates, returns from plan asset investments, and actuarial assumptions including the life expectancies of the plan’s participants. Our ability to adequately fund or meet our future obligations with respect to the plan could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.A change in a customer’s creditworthiness could result in significant accounts receivable write-offs.As a normal course of business, we extend credit to certain of our customers.  The amount of credit extended to customers is based upon the due diligence performed, including, but not limited to, the review of the potential customer’s financial statements and banking information.  The Company may perform various credit checks and evaluate the customer's previous payment history.  While we do not believe we have significant concentration of sales with any one customer, we have certain larger customers, which could result in a significant amount of credit exposure if there is a sudden or severe change in the customer’s creditworthiness.  We monitor our outstanding receivables on a regular basis; however, if a customer with large credit exposure is unable to make payment on its outstanding receivables, we could experience a significant write-off of accounts receivable.If our goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets were to become impaired, our net income and results of operations could be negatively affected.As of February 28, 2023, we had goodwill totaling $702.5 million and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaling $1.5 million on our consolidated balance sheet. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Indefinite-lived intangibles are comprised of certain tradenames.  We test goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life for potential impairment annually, in the fourth quarter, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of the Company below its carrying amount.  Factors that could indicate that our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, lower than projected operating results and cash flows and economic downturns or slower growth rates in our industry, market downturns or major events like a global pandemic.  Our stock price historically has shown volatility and often fluctuates significantly in response to market and other factors.  Declines in our stock price, lower operating results and any decline in industry conditions in the future could increase the risk of impairment.  The evaluation for impairment includes our estimates of future operating results and cash flows, estimates of allocations of certain assets and cash flows among reporting segments, estimates of future growth rates, and our judgment regarding the applicable discount rates used on estimated operating results and cash flows.Should a review indicate impairment, a write-down of the carrying value of the goodwill or intangible asset would occur, resulting in a non-cash charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements, impact our creditability with our shareholders, or impact our relationships with our customers, suppliers or supporting banks. We are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations in the international markets in which we operate.We operate in the United States and Canada and anticipate that there will be instances in which sales and costs will not be exactly matched with respect to foreign currency denomination.  Gains and losses from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities that are receivable or payable in currencies other than our subsidiaries’ functional currency are included in our consolidated statements of income.  In addition, currency fluctuations cause the U.S. dollar value of our Canadian results of operations and net assets to vary with exchange rate fluctuations.  A decrease in the value of the Canadian currency relative to the U.S. dollar could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. As we continue to expand geographically, we could experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings or net assets solely as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.  In the future, we may utilize derivative instruments to manage the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that could potentially impact our future earnings and forecasted cash flows. However, the markets in which we operate could restrict the removal or conversion of the local or foreign currency, resulting in our inability to hedge against some or all of these risks or increase our cost of conversion of local currency to U.S. dollar.16Table of ContentsOur operations entail inherent risks that may result in substantial liability.  We do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities.Our manufacturing processes and services provided to our customers entail inherent risks, including equipment defects, malfunctions and failures.  The insurance we carry to mitigate many of these risks may not be adequate to cover future claims or losses.  In addition, we are substantially self-insured for workers’ compensation, employer’s liability, property, general liability and employee group health claims in view of the relatively high per-incident deductibles we absorb under our insurance arrangements for these risks.  Further, insurance covering the risks we expect to face or in the amounts we desire may not be available in the future or, if available, the premiums may not be commercially justifiable.  If we were to incur substantial liability and such damages were not covered by insurance or were in excess of policy limits, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.Tax legislation and administrative initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We operate in locations throughout the U.S. and Canada and, as a result, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of U.S. federal, state, local and the Canadian governments. From time to time, various legislative or administrative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions.  In addition, U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations.  Moreover, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving any future tax disputes favorably more difficult. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.  Changes to our tax positions resulting from future tax legislation and administrative initiatives or challenges from taxing authorities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Interest Rate RiskAn increase in interest rates would increase interest costs on variable-rate debt and could adversely impact the ability to refinance existing debt. We currently have $1.13 billion of gross debt outstanding that bears interest at variable rates that reset periodically and are generally based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR"") or Base Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement. We utilize interest rate swaps to mitigate the interest rate risk, and we have hedged approximately one-half of our gross debt outstanding. However, approximately one-half of our gross debt outstanding is unhedged. If interest rates increase, so will the interest costs, which could adversely affect cash flow and the ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and the ability to make distributions to shareholders. In addition, rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures. An increase in interest rates could also affect our ability to make new investments on favorable terms or at all.We may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future, which could affect our financial condition, may decrease our profitability or could dilute our shareholders.We may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future, subject to restrictions in our debt agreements.  If our cash flow from operations is less than we anticipate, or if our cash requirements are more than we expect, we may require more financing.  However, debt or equity financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.  If we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of preferred stock, the terms of the debt or preferred stock issued may give the holders rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, particularly in the event of liquidation.  The terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have.  If we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity, our shareholders’ ownership in us would be diluted.  If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, it could affect our financial health, which could negatively affect our shareholders.General Risks FactorsThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.The market price of our stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:•the inability to meet the financial estimates of analysts who follow our common stock;•strategic actions by us or our competitors;•announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;•variations in our quarterly operating results and those of our competitors;17Table of Contents•general economic and stock market conditions;•risks relating to our business and our industry, including those discussed above;•changes in conditions or trends in our industry, markets or customers;•cyber-attacks, terrorist acts or armed hostilities;•future sales of our common stock or other securities;•repurchases of our outstanding shares;•material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting; and•investor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our Company relative to other investment alternatives.These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.  In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our common stock is low. 18Table of Contents"
8,AZZ,AZZ INC,2022-04-22,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
Our business is subject to a variety of risks, including, but not limited to, the risks described below, which we believe are the most significant risks and uncertainties facing our business. Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or not described below may also impair our business operations in the future. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations and future growth could be negatively or materially impacted.Risks Related to OperationsThe duration of the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain and may have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products and services or with our supply chain.The continued uncertainty associated with COVID-19, and any of the ongoing variants, did not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the year ended February 28, 2022.  While we continue to support our customers, there remains uncertainties regarding the duration and, to what extent, if any, that the COVID-19 pandemic, or newly identified variants, or additional regulatory requirements, will ultimately have on the demand for our products and services or with our supply chain or our employees. The impact of COVID-19 to the Company's personnel and operations has been limited.  During fiscal 2022, the Company continued to see improvement in sales and operating income in both of its operating segments. We cannot reasonably estimate the severity of this pandemic or the government's mandates regarding the same, or the extent to which the disruption may materially impact our consolidated balance sheets, statements of income or statements of cash flows for fiscal year 2023 or beyond. Catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.The occurrence of catastrophic events ranging from acts of war and terrorism, natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, or the outbreaks of epidemic, pandemic or contagious diseases such as COVID-19, could potentially cause future disruption in our business. At this time, the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has not materially impacted our operations, especially in Poland, which borders Ukraine. The Company continues to closely monitor the situation with our Poland-based employees and operations. These disruptions could include the temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers or suppliers and their contract manufacturers, which could restrict our ability to complete projects on schedule.  Any disruption of our customers or suppliers and their respective contract manufacturers could likely impact our future sales and operating results.  In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic, or the spread of any other contagious diseases, could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, and result in an economic downturn that could affect the demand for our products and services.  These situations are outside of the Company’s control and any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.Our business segments operate in highly competitive markets.Many of our competitors, primarily in our Infrastructure Solutions segment, are much larger and have substantially more resources than AZZ. Competition is based on a number of factors, including price. Certain competitors may have lower cost structures or larger economies of scale on raw materials and may, therefore, be able to provide their products and services at lower prices than we are able to provide. If our response to competitor pricing actions is not timely, we could be impacted by loss of market share.  We cannot be certain that our competitors will not develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services or products that are superior in price, delivery time or quality in the future. Similarly, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position within our industries, maintain our customer base at current levels or increase our customer base.Our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.Our quarterly results may be materially and adversely affected by: •changes in political landscapes across the globe;•unstable political economic conditions and public health issues delaying customer operations;•timing and volume of work under new or existing agreements;•general economic conditions;•fluctuations in the budgetary spending of customers, including seasonality;•increases in design, manufacturing or transportation costs;11Table of Contents•variations in margins, due to sales price or manufacturing complexities, of projects performed during any particular quarter;•losses experienced in our operations not otherwise covered by insurance; •delays of raw materials or component suppliers;•a change in the demand or production of our products and our services caused by severe weather conditions;•a change in the mix of our customers, contracts and business;•modifications or changes in customer delivery schedules; and•ability or willingness of customers to timely pay their invoices when owed to us.Accordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results expected for any other quarter or for the entire year.Our business requires skilled labor, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees.Our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability could be limited by an inability to employ, train and retain skilled personnel necessary to meet our labor requirements. We have experienced a constrained labor market during the COVID-19 pandemic and we could experience additional shortages of qualified or trained personnel. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an adequately skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy or that our labor costs will not increase as a result of shortage in the supply of skilled personnel. Labor shortages or increased labor-related costs could impair our ability to maintain our profit margins or impact our ability to sustain and grow our sales.Technological innovations by competitors may make existing products and production methods obsolete.The manufactured products and services we sell require evolving technologies for success in the markets we serve. The competitive environments can be highly sensitive to technological innovation. It is possible for our competitors, or new market place entrants, both foreign and domestic, to develop new products, production methods or technology which could make existing products, services or methods obsolete or at least hasten their obsolescence or materially reduce our competitive advantage in the markets that we serve.Our business segments are cyclical and are sensitive to economic downturns.Our business often aligns with the economic environments that we operate within, and, especially in our specialty welding business, is subjected to refinery turnaround or utility outages which cause cyclicality within the annual operating cycle of the business.  Our customers may delay or cancel new or previously planned projects. If there is a reduction in demand for our products or services, as a result of a downturn in the general economies in which we operate, there could be a material adverse effect on price levels and the quantity of goods and services purchased by our customers, which could adversely impact our sales, consolidated results from operations and cash flows. A number of factors, including financing conditions and potential bankruptcies in the industries we serve, could adversely affect our customers and their ability or willingness to fund their internal projects in the future and pay for services or equipment. Certain economic conditions may also impact the financial condition of one or more of our key suppliers, which could affect our ability to secure raw materials and components to meet our customers’ demand for our products in the future. Other various factors impact demand for our products and services, including the price of commodities (such as oil, electricity or other commodities), economic forecasts and financial markets. Uncertainty in the global economy and financial markets could impact our customers and could, in turn, severely impact the demand for corporate infrastructure projects that would result in a reduction in orders for our products and services. All of these factors combined together could materially impact our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and potentially impact the trading price of our common stock.Volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices could impact demand or pricing for products or services in segments of our Infrastructure Solutions segment and, as a result, adversely affect our business.Our results of operations depend upon the level of activity in the global energy market, including oil and natural gas development, and production. Oil and natural gas exploration and development activity and the number of well completions typically decline when there is a sustained reduction in oil or natural gas prices or significant instability in energy markets. Even the perception of longer-term lower oil or natural gas prices by oil and natural gas exploration, development and production companies can result in their decision to cancel, reduce or postpone major expenditures or to reduce or shut in well production, which can impact our businesses that provide equipment into these markets, or service downstream refineries and energy plants.Oil and natural gas prices and the level of drilling and exploration activity can be volatile. In periods of volatile commodity prices, the timing of any change in activity levels by our customers is difficult to predict. As a result, our ability to 12Table of Contentsproject the anticipated activity level for our business, and particularly our Infrastructure Solutions welding-service sales may be limited.During periods of lower oil or natural gas prices, our customers typically decrease their capital expenditures, which generally results in lower activity levels. A reduction in demand for our products, solutions and services could force us to reduce our pricing substantially, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.During periods of higher oil or natural gas prices, our customers may increase their capital expenditures, or they may determine pricing and utilization is critical and reduce the typical turnaround activities to keep their facilities running during periods with higher prices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, customer cash flows and returns on capital drive customer investment priorities. Industry observers believe shareholders are encouraging management teams of energy companies to focus operational and compensation strategies on returns and free cash flow generation rather than solely on growth. To accomplish these strategies, energy companies may need to better prioritize or reduce capital spending, which could impact resource allocation and production, ultimately constraining the number of new projects by our customers.If our customers seek to preserve capital by canceling contracts, canceling or delaying scheduled maintenance of their existing equipment, or canceling or delaying orders with us, the demand for our products, solutions and services could be materially and adversely affected. Such a drop in demand could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.International events and political issues may adversely affect our Infrastructure Solutions and Metal Coatings segments.A portion of the sales from our Infrastructure Solutions and Metal Coatings segments are from markets outside the U.S. The occurrence of any of the risks described below could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition: •political and economic instability in the countries we conduct business;•social unrest, acts of war and terrorism, natural disasters, and global outbreaks of contagious diseases;•inflation, or hyper-inflation;•significant currency fluctuations, currency devaluations or restrictions on currency conversions;•governmental activities that limit or disrupt markets, restrict payments or limit the movement of funds;•trade restrictions, tariffs and economic embargoes by the United States or other countries; and•travel restrictions placed upon personnel, limiting travel to install equipment or perform services for our customers.Fluctuations in the price and supply of raw materials and natural gas for our business segments may adversely affect our operations.Primarily in our Metal Coatings segment, zinc and natural gas represent a large portion of our cost of sales. The prices of zinc and natural gas are subject to volatility and we have experienced commodity price escalation over the past year. We purchase a wide variety of raw materials for our Infrastructure Solutions segment to manufacture our products, including copper, aluminum, steel and nickel. Unanticipated increases in raw material requirements or commodity price increases could significantly increase production costs and potentially adversely affect profitability. The following factors, which are beyond our control, affect the price of raw materials and natural gas for our business segments: •supply and demand; •freight costs and transportation availability; •trade duties and taxes; and •labor disputes. We seek to maintain our operating margins by increasing the price of our products and services in response to increased costs, but may not be successful in passing these increased costs of operation through to our customers.A failure in our operational information systems or cyber security attacks on any of our facilities, or those of third parties, may adversely affect our financial results.Our business is heavily supported by operational systems to process large amounts of data and support complex transactions. If significant financial, operational, or other data processing systems fail, are attacked by intruders or have other 13Table of Contentssignificant shortcomings, our financial results could be adversely affected. Our financial results could also be adversely affected if an employee causes our operational systems to fail, either as a result of inadvertent error or by deliberately tampering with or manipulating our financial or operational systems. Due to increased technology advances, we are more reliant on technologies to support our operations. We use computer software and programs to run our financial and operational information, and this may subject our business to increased risks. Cyber-attacks are an ever-increasing risk to companies. Any significant cyber security attacks that affect our facilities, our customers, our key suppliers, or material financial data could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, cyber-attacks on our customers, suppliers and employee data may result in a financial loss, including potential fines for failure to safeguard data, and may negatively impact our reputation. Third-party systems on which we rely could also suffer operational system failure. Any of these occurrences could disrupt our business, result in potential liability or reputational damage or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial results.If we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, we may lose some of our competitive advantage. We possess intellectual property, which is instrumental in our ability to compete and grow our business. If our intellectual property rights are not adequately protected, we could lose our competitive advantage. There can be no assurance that our patent applications will result in patents being issued or that current or additional patents will afford protection against competitors. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret protection and contractual rights to establish and protect our intellectual property. Failure of our patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret protection, non-disclosure agreements and other measures to provide protection of our technology and our intellectual property rights could enable our competitors to more effectively compete with us and could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our trade secrets and proprietary know-how may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by others. No guarantee can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or manufacturing and service know-how and techniques, or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology.Product defects could increase our warranty costs and could result in product liability claims.Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of our products and the products of third-party vendors which we use or resell.  Many of our products and solutions can be complex and include sophisticated and potentially sensitive electronic components. We have increasingly manufactured certain of those components and products in our own facilities.  Widespread product recalls could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, penalties, and lost sales due to the unavailability of a product for a period of time. We may also be liable if the use of any of our products causes harm and could suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us in excess of its insurance limits. We may not be able to obtain indemnity or reimbursement from our suppliers or other third parties for the warranty costs or liabilities associated with our supplier products. A significant product recall, warranty claim, or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our business reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our products.Risks Related to StrategyOur acquisition strategy involves a number of risks.We intend to pursue continued growth through acquiring the assets of target companies that will enable us to (i) expand our product and service offerings and (ii) increase our geographic footprint. We routinely review potential acquisitions. However, we may be unable to implement this growth strategy if we are not able to reach agreement on mutually acceptable terms. Moreover, our acquisition strategy involves certain risks, including: •risks and liabilities from our acquisitions that may not be discovered during the pre-acquisition due diligence process;•difficulties in the post-acquisition integration of operations and systems;•the termination of relationships with key personnel and customers of the acquired company;•the potential failure to add additional employees to manage the increased volume of business;•additional post-acquisition challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, financial reporting and legal compliance;•a disruption of our ongoing business or an inability of our ongoing business to receive sufficient management attention; and•a failure to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated prior to acquisition.Future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available to us, and may increase our leverage ratios.14Table of ContentsWe may be unsuccessful at implementing and generating internal growth from our Strategic Growth Initiatives.Our ability to generate internal growth will be affected by, among other factors, our ability to: •attract new customers, internationally and domestically;•integrate regulatory changes;•increase the number or size of projects performed for existing customers;•hire and retain employees; and•increase volume utilizing existing facilities.Many of the factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth through our initiatives may be beyond our control, and we cannot be certain that our strategies will be successful or that we will be able to generate cash flow sufficient to fund our operations and to support internal growth. If we are unsuccessful, we may not be able to achieve internal growth, expand our operations or grow our business.The departure of key personnel could disrupt our business.We depend on the continued efforts of our executive officers and senior management team. We cannot be certain that any individual will continue in such capacity for any particular period of time. The future loss of key personnel, or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees, could negatively impact our ability to manage our business.Risks Related to Legal Liability and Regulations Actual and potential claims, lawsuits, and proceedings could ultimately reduce our profitability and liquidity and negatively impact our financial condition.The Company could be named as a defendant in legal proceedings claiming damages from us in connection with the operation of our business. Most actions filed against our Company typically arise out of the normal course of business related to commercial disputes regarding equipment we manufacture or services we provide. We could potentially be a plaintiff in legal proceedings against our customers, in which we seek to recover payments of contractual amounts we believe are due to us, and indemnity claims for increased costs or damages incurred by our Company. Under applicable accounting literature, and when appropriate, we establish financial provisions for certain legal exposures meeting the criteria of being both probable and reasonably estimable. Where material, we may adjust any such financial provisions from time to time depending on developments related to each case. If our assumptions and estimates related to such exposures prove to be inadequate or incorrect, or we have material adverse claims or lawsuits, they could harm our business reputation, divert management resources away from operating our business, and result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.Our operations could be adversely impacted by the effects of future changes to the law and government regulations regarding emissions, the global environment and other sustainability matters.Various regulations have been implemented regarding emissions, the global environment and other sustainability matters. We cannot predict future changes in the law and government regulations regarding emissions, the global environment and other sustainability matters, or what actions may be taken by our customers or other industry participants in response to any future legislation. While the Company actively is engaged in building our environmental, social and governance programs, changes in laws or governmental regulations could negatively impact our business or the demand for our products and services by customers, other industry related participants, or our investors, and could result in a negative impact to our operations, profitability, or our ability to perform projects in the future.Changes to U.S. trade policy, tariff and import/export regulations and foreign government regulations could adversely affect our business, operating results, foreign operations, sourcing and financial condition.Changes in U.S. or international social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories or countries where we currently manufacture, distribute and/or sell our products or conduct our business, as well as any negative sentiment toward the U.S. as a result of such changes, could adversely affect our business. New tariffs, changes in existing tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy have the potential to adversely impact the economies in which we operate or certain sectors thereof, our industry and the global demand for our products, and as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.  In addition, we cannot predict the full impact trade policy changes that have been asserted by the U.S. presidential administration and Congress, including anticipated changes to current trade policies will be maintained or modified or whether 15Table of Contentsthe entry into new bilateral or multilateral trade agreements will occur, nor can we accurately predict the effects that any changes will have on our future business.Our business is also subject to risks associated with U.S. and foreign legislation and regulations relating to imports, including quotas, duties, tariffs or taxes, and other charges or restrictions on imports, which could adversely affect our operations and our ability to import or export products at current or increased levels, and substantially all of our import operations are subject to customs duties on imported products imposed by the governments where our production facilities are located, including raw materials. We cannot predict whether additional U.S. and foreign customs quotas, duties (including antidumping or countervailing duties), tariffs, taxes or other charges or restrictions, requirements as to where raw materials must be purchased, reporting obligations pertaining to “conflict minerals” mined from certain countries, additional workplace regulations, or other restrictions on our imports will be imposed upon the importation or exportation of our products in the future or adversely modified, or what effect such actions would have on our costs of operations. Future quotas, duties, or tariffs may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Future trade agreements could also provide our competitors with an advantage over us, or increase our costs, either of which could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Regulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business.Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, which established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for publicly-traded companies that use tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold (collectively, “conflict minerals”) mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in their products, we are subject to certain annual disclosures and audit requirements. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including costs for due diligence to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes, or sources of supply. Despite our continued due diligence efforts, in the future we may be unable to verify the origin of all conflict minerals used in our component products. As a result, we could potentially face reputational and other challenges with our customers that require that all of the components incorporated in our products be certified as conflict-free.Adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations could make it easier for our employees to obtain union representation and our business could be adversely impacted.As of February 28, 2022, approximately 795 of our variable workforce employees and 278 of our full-time employees were represented by unions. Our U.S.-based employees have the right at any time under the National Labor Relations Act to form or affiliate with a union. If a large portion of our workforce were to become unionized and the terms of the collective bargaining agreement were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements, it could increase our operating costs and adversely impact our profitability. Any changes in regulations, the imposition of new regulations, or the enactment of new legislation could have an adverse impact on our business to the extent it becomes easier for workers to obtain union representation.Changes in labor or employment laws, including minimum wage rules or COVID-19 benefits, could increase our costs and may adversely affect our business.Various federal, state and international labor and employment laws govern our relationship with employees and affect operating costs.  These laws include minimum wage requirements, overtime, unemployment tax rates, workers’ compensation rates, leaves of absence, mandated health and other benefits, and citizenship requirements.  Significant additional government-imposed increases or new requirements in these areas could materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows.Risks Related to Environmental ConditionsClimate change could impact our business.Climate changes could result in an adverse impact on our operations, particularly in hurricane prone or low-lying areas near the ocean or heavy snowfall and ice regions. We cannot predict the potential timing or impact from potential global warming, winter storms and other natural disasters.  We carry certain limits of insurance to mitigate the potential effects of events that could impact our businesses, as well as disaster recovery plans related to any potential natural disasters that might occur within regions in which we have operations, or at any of the Company locations.Changes in environmental laws and regulations and heightened focus on corporate sustainability initiatives and practices are under increased scrutiny by both governmental and non-governmental bodies, which could cause a change in our business practices by increasing capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs, which could impact our future operating results.16Table of ContentsOver the past year there has been a heightened focus by both governmental and non-governmental bodies requesting disclosure of information relating to our corporate sustainable practices as well as customers are increasingly preferring to source from suppliers who have implemented effective sustainability initiatives. International agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions and require companies to more efficiently use energy, water and reduce waste, are in various stages of discussion and/or implementation across the globe. These laws, regulations and policies, as well other sustainability demands made by governmental and non-governmental bodies may result in the need for future capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs. We cannot predict the level of expenditures or potential impact to the Company that may be required to comply with these evolving environmental and sustainability laws and regulations due to the uncertainties on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction in which we operate, and our activities in each one of these jurisdictions.The financial impact of the heightened focus on sustainability practices for all companies to increase efficiencies in consumption of resources and future regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions will depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to:•the sectors covered;•future permitted levels for greenhouse gas emissions;•the extent to which we would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to invest in additional compliance equipment or compliance instruments, either on the open market or through auctions; •the price and availability of emission allowances and credits; and •the impact of legislation or other regulation on our ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of our products and services.Risks Related to Financial MattersOur use of over time revenue accounting in the Infrastructure Solutions segment could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits.As discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,” in our Critical Audit Matters in our financial statements, and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, portions of our sales are recognized over time. Over time revenue recognition causes us to recognize contract sales and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs. The earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract sales, costs and profitability. Contract losses are recognized in full at the time a recognized project loss is expected, and contract profit estimates are adjusted based on ongoing reviews of contract profitability. Actual collection of contract amounts, including the impacts of change orders, could differ from originally estimated amounts and could result in adjustments to sales, earnings, or both. In certain circumstances, it is possible that such adjustments could be significant.Our volume of fixed-price contracts for our Infrastructure Solutions segment could adversely affect our business.We currently generate, and expect to continue to generate, a significant portion of our sales under fixed-price contracts. In these types of contractual arrangements, we estimate the costs of completing a particular project in order to make our fixed-price proposal under these type of contracts. The actual cost of labor and materials, however, are likely to vary from originally estimated project expenditures. Based upon the size of a particular project, variations from estimated cost to actually incurred costs could have a significant impact on our operating results in a given quarter or year.We may not be able to fully realize the sales value reported in our backlog for our Infrastructure Solutions segment. Due to the lead time required to design, procure and manufacture products or provide forward-looking services, primarily in our Infrastructure Solutions segment, we receive orders and maintain a backlog of future work.  Orders included in our backlog are supported by customer purchase orders or contracts, often supported under Master Service Agreements, which we believe to be firm orders.  Backlog develops as a result of new business secured, which represents the contractual value of new project commitments received by us during a given period. Backlog consists of orders which have either (1) not been started or (2) are in progress and are not yet complete. In the latter case, the revenue value reported in backlog is the remaining value associated with work that has not yet been completed, which can vary depending on whether the contract is over-time, or at a point in time. Orders recorded as new business or new backlog can sometimes be cancelled. In the event of cancellation, we are often reimbursed for incurred costs plus a margin on those costs, but typically have no contractual right to the total sales reflected in our backlog. In addition to being unable to recover certain direct costs, we could also incur additional costs resulting from underutilized facilities if orders are cancelled.17Table of ContentsThe Company’s flexibility to operate its business could be impacted by provisions in its debt obligations.The Company’s debt instruments, consisting of senior notes and a revolving credit facility, contain covenants which restrict or prohibit certain actions (“negative covenants”), including, but not limited to, the Company's ability to incur debt, restrict or limit certain liens, capital spending limits, engage in certain merger, acquisition, or divestiture actions, or increase dividends beyond a specific level. The Company’s debt instruments also contain covenants requiring the Company to, among other things, maintain specified financial ratios (“affirmative covenants”). Failure to comply with these negative covenants and affirmative covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could restrict the Company’s access to liquidity and have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business or prospects. If the Company does not have enough cash to service its debt or fund other liquidity needs, the Company may be required to take actions such as requesting a waiver from lenders, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing all or part of the existing debt, or seeking additional equity capital.  The Company cannot assure that any of these remedies can be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all.We could face significant liabilities for withdrawal from Multiemployer Pension Plans.The Company is a participating employer in a number of trustee-managed multiemployer defined benefit pension plans for employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In the event of our withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan, we may incur costs associated with our obligations for unfunded vested benefits at the time of the withdrawal. Depending on various factors, a future withdrawal could have a material adverse effect on results of operations or cash flows for a particular reporting period.A change in a customer’s creditworthiness could result in significant accounts receivable write-offs.As a normal course of business, we extend credit to certain of our customers. The amount of credit extended to customers is based upon the due diligence performed, including, but not limited to, the review of the potential customer’s financial statements and banking information.  The Company may perform various credit checks and evaluate the customer's previous payment history.  While we do not believe we have significant concentration of sales with any one customer, we have certain larger customers, which could result in a significant amount of credit exposure if there is a sudden or severe change in the customer’s creditworthiness. We monitor our outstanding receivables on a regular basis; however, if a customer with large credit exposure is unable to make payment on its outstanding receivables, we could experience a significant write-off of accounts receivable.If our goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets were to become impaired, our net income and results of operations could be negatively affected.Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Indefinite-lived intangibles are comprised of certain tradenames, customer relationships, and other intangible assets. We test goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life for potential impairment annually, in the fourth quarter, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the Company below its carrying amount.  Factors that could indicate that our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, lower than projected operating results and cash flows and economic downturns or slower growth rates in our industry, market downturns or major events like a global pandemic. Our stock price historically has shown volatility and often fluctuates significantly in response to market and other factors. Declines in our stock price, lower operating results and any decline in industry conditions in the future could increase the risk of impairment. The evaluation for impairment includes our estimates of future operating results and cash flows, estimates of allocations of certain assets and cash flows among reporting segments, estimates of future growth rates, and our judgment regarding the applicable discount rates used on estimated operating results and cash flows.Should a review indicate impairment, a write-down of the carrying value of the goodwill or intangible asset would occur, resulting in a non-cash charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements, impact our creditability with our shareholders, or impact our relationships with our customers, suppliers or supporting banks. We are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations in the international markets in which we operate.We operate in international countries and anticipate that there will be instances in which sales and costs will not be exactly matched with respect to foreign currency denomination. Gains and losses from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities that are receivable or payable in currencies other than our subsidiaries’ functional currency are included in our consolidated statements of income. In addition, currency fluctuations cause the U.S. dollar value of our international results of operations and net assets to vary with exchange rate fluctuations. A decrease in the value of any of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. As we continue to expand 18Table of Contentsgeographically, we could experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings or net assets solely as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In the future, we may utilize derivative instruments to manage the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that could potentially impact our future earnings and forecasted cash flows. However, the markets in which we operate could restrict the removal or conversion of the local or foreign currency, resulting in our inability to hedge against some or all of these risks or increase our cost of conversion of local currency to U.S. dollar.Our operations entail inherent risks that may result in substantial liability. We do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities.Our manufacturing processes and services provided to our customers entail inherent risks, including equipment defects, malfunctions and failures.  The insurance we carry to mitigate many of these risks may not be adequate to cover future claims or losses. In addition, we are substantially self-insured for workers’ compensation, employer’s liability, property, general liability and employee group health claims in view of the relatively high per-incident deductibles we absorb under our insurance arrangements for these risks. Further, insurance covering the risks we expect to face or in the amounts we desire may not be available in the future or, if available, the premiums may not be commercially justifiable. If we were to incur substantial liability and such damages were not covered by insurance or were in excess of policy limits, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.Tax legislation and administrative initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We operate in locations throughout the U.S. and internationally and, as a result, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign governments. From time to time, various legislative or administrative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions. In addition, U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Moreover, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving any future tax disputes favorably more difficult. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge. Changes to our tax positions resulting from future tax legislation and administrative initiatives or challenges from taxing authorities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Changes in the method pursuant to which the LIBOR rates are determined and potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may adversely affect our results of operations.LIBOR and certain other “benchmarks” are the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. In particular, on July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee consisting of large U.S. financial institutions convened by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has recommended replacing LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), an index supported by short-term Treasury repurchase agreements. On November 30, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration (“IBA”), the administrator of USD LIBOR announced that it does not intend to cease publication of the remaining USD LIBOR tenors until June 30, 2023, providing additional time for existing contracts that are dependent on LIBOR to mature. It is unclear whether, at that time, LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established. As of February 28, 2022, $77.0 million of the borrowings under our revolving credit facility had interest rate payments determined directly or indirectly based on LIBOR. Any uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate could adversely affect the performance of LIBOR relative to its historic values. If the methods of calculating LIBOR change from current methods for any reason, or if LIBOR ceases to perform as it has historically, our interest expense associated with our outstanding indebtedness or any future indebtedness we incur may increase. Further, when LIBOR ceases to exist, we may be forced to substitute an alternative reference rate under our revolving credit facility or rely on base rate borrowings in lieu of LIBOR-based borrowings. Although SOFR appears to be the preferred replacement rate for USD LIBOR, it is unclear if other benchmarks may emerge or if other rates will be adopted outside of the U.S. Any such alternative reference rate may increase the interest expense associated with our existing or future indebtedness. Any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our borrowing costs, business and results of operations.We may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future, which could affect our financial condition, may decrease our profitability or could dilute our shareholders.We may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future, subject to restrictions in our debt agreements. If our cash flow from operations is less than we anticipate, or if our cash requirements are more than we expect, we may require more financing. However, debt or equity financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we incur additional 19Table of Contentsdebt or raise equity through the issuance of preferred stock, the terms of the debt or preferred stock issued may give the holders rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, particularly in the event of liquidation. The terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have. If we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity, our shareholders’ ownership in us would be diluted. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, it could affect our financial health, which could negatively affect our shareholders.General Risks FactorsThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.The market price of our stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:•the inability to meet the financial estimates of analysts who follow our common stock;•strategic actions by us or our competitors;•announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;•variations in our quarterly operating results and those of our competitors;•general economic and stock market conditions;•risks relating to our business and our industry, including those discussed above;•changes in conditions or trends in our industry, markets or customers;•cyber-attacks, terrorist acts or armed hostilities;•future sales of our common stock or other securities;•repurchases of our outstanding shares;•material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting; and•investor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our Company relative to other investment alternatives.These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our common stock is low. Risks Related to the Precoat AcquisitionOn March 7, 2022, the Company and Sequa, a portfolio company of global investment firm Carlyle, jointly announced the signing of a definitive agreement whereby the Company intends to acquire Sequa's Precoat Metals business division (the ""Precoat Acquisition"").  The Precoat Acquisition, which is subject to certain normal and customary closing conditions, is expected to close during the first quarter of the Company's fiscal year 2023.  We have identified the risks described below, that are specific to this transaction.We expect to incur material expenses and indebtedness related to the Precoat Acquisition.We expect to incur material expenses and indebtedness in completing the Precoat Acquisition and integrating the business, operations, people, practices, policies and procedures of Precoat. While we have assumed that a certain level of transaction and integration expenses would be incurred, there are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of integration expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time. We also intend to finance a portion of the consideration for the Precoat Acquisition through the incurrence of indebtedness, which would increase our debt service obligations.  The Company has obtained financing commitments required to complete the transaction, consisting of a $400.0 million revolving credit facility, and a $1.525 billion senior secured term loan facility.  As part of the transaction, we also expect to repay our current 2020 Senior Notes, which will include an early termination premium. Our new financing will have interest rates that are higher than our current notes, resulting in higher interest expense, and may have more restrictive covenant compliance requirements than our existing credit facility.  The new debt will also significantly increase the Company's leverage. These additional expenses, indebtedness and leverage may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.20Table of ContentsWe may not realize the anticipated benefits from the pending Precoat Acquisition.The Precoat Acquisition involves the combination of two companies that currently operate as independent companies. While we and Precoat will continue to operate independently until the completion of the Precoat Acquisition, the success of the Precoat Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from successfully combining our and Precoat’s businesses after closing. We plan on devoting substantial management attention and resources to integrating our and Precoat’s business practices so that we can fully realize the anticipated benefits of the Precoat Acquisition. Nonetheless, the business and assets acquired may not be successful or continue to grow at the same rate as when operated independently or may require greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. The Precoat Acquisition could also result in the assumption of unknown or contingent liabilities.Potential difficulties we may encounter following closing include the following:•the inability to successfully combine our and Precoat’s businesses in a manner that permits us to realize the anticipated benefits of the Precoat Acquisition in the time frame currently anticipated, or at all;•the failure to integrate internal systems, programs and controls, or decisions by our management to apply different accounting policies, assumptions or judgments to Precoat’s operational results than Precoat applied in the past;•loss of sales and other commercial relationships;•the complexities associated with managing the combined company;•the failure to retain key employees of either of the two companies that may be difficult to replace;•the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in services, standards, controls, procedures and policies;•potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the Precoat Acquisition; and•performance shortfalls at one or both of the two companies as a result of the diversion of management’s attention caused by completing the Precoat Acquisition and integrating our and Precoat’s operations.The pending Precoat Acquisition may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or terms, or at all.Consummation of the Precoat Acquisition is conditioned on, among other things, the receipt of certain consents and other approvals under the competition laws of various jurisdictions. Neither we nor Sequa can provide assurance that the conditions to completing the Precoat Acquisition will be satisfied or waived, and accordingly, that the Precoat Acquisition will be completed on the terms or timeline that the parties anticipate or at all. If any condition to the Precoat Acquisition is not satisfied, it could delay or prevent the Precoat Acquisition from occurring, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.Failure to complete the pending Precoat Acquisition could have an adverse effect on us.If the Precoat Acquisition is not completed, our business may be subject to a number of risks, including the following:•the market price of our securities could decline;•we will be required to pay certain costs relating to the Precoat Acquisition, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor, filing, printing and mailing fees and integration costs that have already been incurred or will continue to be incurred until the closing of the Precoat Acquisition, whether or not the Precoat Acquisition is completed;•if the agreement with Sequa is terminated, our stockholders cannot be certain that we will be able to find another acquisition opportunity as attractive to us as the Precoat Acquisition;•we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Precoat Acquisition or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the Purchase Agreement;•we will not realize the benefit of the time and resources, financial and otherwise, committed by our management to matters relating to the Precoat Acquisition that could have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities;•we may experience reputational harm due to the adverse perception of any failure to successfully complete the Precoat Acquisition or negative reactions from the financial markets or from our customers, vendors, employees and other commercial relationships.21Table of Contents"
4,AZZ,AZZ INC,2021-04-23,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
Our business is subject to a variety of risks, including, but not limited to the risks described below, which we believe are the most significant risks and uncertainties facing our business. Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or not described below may also impair our business operations in the future. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations and future growth could be negatively or materially impacted.Risks Related to OperationsThe duration of the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain and may have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products and services or with our supply chain.In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the viral strain of coronavirus (""COVID-19"") a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. The spread of COVID-19 has resulted in most governments issuing restrictive orders, including “shelter in place” orders around the globe to assist in mitigating the spread of the virus.Subsequently, in March 2020, the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) department issued guidance clarifying that critical infrastructure industries have a responsibility to maintain operations while these restrictive measures are in place. Based on input from the government, as well as our customers, we continued our operations under the CISA guidelines in an effort to support critical infrastructure in the areas where we were either required to do so, or where we are able.While we continue to support our customers, there remains uncertainty regarding the duration and, to what extent, if any, the COVID-19 pandemic, or newly identified variants, will ultimately have on the demand for our products and services or our supply chain. We continue to closely monitor the situation as information becomes readily available, take on actions to provide for the safety of our personnel, and to abide by the requirements under CISA.Our operations remain open globally and the impact of COVID-19 on our personnel and operations has been somewhat limited during the year. The most significant impact to us has been in our ability to serve customers at their respective business and project locations.  We have experienced some customer order deferrals, but there have been few customer order cancellations. While governments have taken actions, including the dissemination of vaccines to limit the impacts of COVID-19, we cannot reasonably estimate the length or severity of this ongoing pandemic, or the extent to which the disruption may materially impact our consolidated balance sheet, statements of income or statements of cash flows for fiscal year 2022.Catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.The occurrence of catastrophic events ranging from acts of war and terrorism, natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, or the outbreaks of epidemic, pandemic or contagious diseases such as COVID-19, could potentially cause future disruption in our business. These disruptions could include the temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers or suppliers and their contract manufacturers, which could restrict our ability to complete projects on schedule.  Any disruption of our customers or suppliers and their respective contract manufacturers could likely impact our future sales and operating results.  In addition, continued pandemic, or the spread of any other contagious diseases could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, and result in an economic downturn that could affect the demand for our products and services.  These situations are outside of the Company’s control and any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.Our business segments operate in highly competitive markets.Many of our competitors, primarily in our Infrastructure Solutions segment, are significantly larger and have substantially more resources than AZZ. Competition is based on a number of factors, including price. Certain competitors may have lower cost structures or larger economies of scale on raw materials and may, therefore, be able to provide their products and services at lower prices than we are able to provide. If our response to competitor pricing actions is not timely, we could be impacted by loss of market share.  We cannot be certain that our competitors will not develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services or products that are superior in price, delivery time or quality in the future. Similarly, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position within our industries, maintain our customer base at current levels or increase our customer base.11Table of ContentsOur operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.Our quarterly results may be materially and adversely affected by: •changes in political landscapes across the globe;•unstable political economic conditions and public health issues delaying customer operations;•timing and volume of work under new or existing agreements;•general economic conditions;•fluctuations in the budgetary spending of customers, including seasonality;•increases in design, manufacturing or transportation costs;•variations in margins, due to sales price or manufacturing complexities, of projects performed during any particular quarter;•losses experienced in our operations not otherwise covered by insurance; •delays of raw materials or component suppliers;•a change in the demand or production of our products and our services caused by severe weather conditions;•a change in the mix of our customers, contracts and business;•modifications or changes in customer delivery schedules; and•ability or willingness of customers to timely pay their invoices when owed to us.Accordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results expected for any other quarter or for the entire year.Our business requires skilled labor, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees.Our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability could be limited by an inability to employ, train and retain skilled personnel necessary to meet our labor requirements. As governmental stimulus benefits continue to be paid and other mega employers increase their minimal paid wages, we could experience future shortages of qualified or trained personnel. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an adequately skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy or that our labor costs will not increase as a result of shortage in the supply of skilled personnel. Labor shortages or increased labor-related costs could impair our ability to maintain our profit margins or impact our ability to sustain and grow our sales.Technological innovations by competitors may make existing products and production methods obsolete.The manufactured products and services we sell require evolving technologies for success in the markets we serve. The competitive environments can be highly sensitive to technological innovation. It is possible for our competitors, or new market place entrants, both foreign and domestic, to develop new products, production methods or technology which could make existing products, services or methods obsolete or at least hasten their obsolescence or materially reduce our competitive advantage in the markets that we serve.Our business segments are cyclical and are sensitive to economic downturns.Our business often aligns with the economic environments that we operate within, and, especially in our specialty welding business, is subjected to refinery turnaround or utility outages which cause cyclicality within the annual operating cycle of the business.  Our customers may delay or cancel new or previously planned projects. If there is a reduction in demand for our products or services, as a result of a downturn in the general economies in which we operate, there could be material adverse effect on price levels and the quantity of goods and services purchased by our customers, therefore adversely impact our sales, consolidated results from operations and cash flows. A number of factors, including financing conditions and potential bankruptcies in the industries we serve, could adversely affect our customers and their ability or willingness to fund their internal projects in the future and pay for services or equipment. Certain economic conditions may also impact the financial condition of one or more of our key suppliers, which could affect our ability to secure raw materials and components to meet our customers’ demand for our products in the future. Other various factors impact demand for our products and services, including the price of commodities (such as oil, electricity or other commodities), economic forecasts and financial markets. Uncertainty in the global economy and financial markets could impact our customers and could in turn severely impact the demand for corporate infrastructure projects that would result in a reduction in orders for our products and services. All of these factors combined together could materially impact our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and potentially impact the trading price of our common stock.12Table of ContentsLow oil and natural gas prices could depress or reduce demand or pricing for products or services in segments of our Infrastructure Solutions segment and, as a result, adversely affect our business.Our results of operations depend upon the level of activity in the global energy market, including oil and natural gas development, and production. Oil and natural gas exploration and development activity and the number of well completions typically decline when there is a sustained reduction in oil or natural gas prices or significant instability in energy markets. Even the perception of longer-term lower oil or natural gas prices by oil and natural gas exploration, development and production companies can result in their decision to cancel, reduce or postpone major expenditures or to reduce or shut in well production which can impact our businesses which provide equipment into these markets, or service downstream refineries and energy plants.Oil and natural gas prices and the level of drilling and exploration activity can be volatile. In periods of volatile commodity prices, the timing of any change in activity levels by our customers is difficult to predict. As a result, our ability to project the anticipated activity level for our business, and particularly our Infrastructure Solutions welding-service sales may be limited.During periods of lower oil or natural gas prices, our customers typically decrease their capital expenditures, which generally results in lower activity levels. A reduction in demand for our products, solutions and services could force us to reduce our pricing substantially, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.In addition, customer cash flows and returns on capital drive customer investment priorities. Industry observers believe shareholders are encouraging management teams of energy companies to focus operational and compensation strategies on returns and free cash flow generation rather than solely on growth. To accomplish these strategies, energy companies may need to better prioritize or reduce capital spending, which could impact resource allocation and production, ultimately constraining the amount of new projects by our customers.If our customers seek to preserve capital by canceling contracts, canceling or delaying scheduled maintenance of their existing equipment, or cancel or delay orders with us, the demand for our products, solutions and services could be materially and adversely affected. Such a drop in demand could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.International events and political issues may adversely affect our Infrastructure Solutions and Metal Coatings segments.A portion of the sales from our Infrastructure Solutions and Metal Coatings segments are from markets outside the U.S. The occurrence of any of the risks described below could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition: •political and economic instability in the countries we conduct business;•social unrest, acts of war and terrorism, natural disasters, and global outbreaks of contagious diseases;•inflation, or hyper-inflation;•significant currency fluctuations, currency devaluations or restrictions on currency conversions;•governmental activities that limit or disrupt markets, restrict payments or limit the movement of funds;•trade restrictions, tariffs and economic embargoes by the United States or other countries; and•travel restrictions placed upon personnel, limiting travel to install equipment or perform services for our customers.Fluctuations in the price and supply of raw materials and natural gas for our business segments may adversely affect our operations.Primarily in our Metal Coatings segment, zinc and natural gas represent a large portion of our cost of sales. The prices of zinc and natural gas are subject to volatility. We purchase a wide variety of raw materials for our Infrastructure Solutions segment to manufacture our products, including copper, aluminum, steel and nickel. Unanticipated increases in raw material requirements or commodity price increases could significantly increase production costs and potentially adversely affect profitability. The following factors, which are beyond our control, affect the price of raw materials and natural gas for our business segments: •supply and demand; •freight costs and transportation availability; •trade duties and taxes; and •labor disputes. 13Table of ContentsWe seek to maintain our operating margins by increasing the price of our products and services in response to increased costs, but may not be successful in passing these increased costs of operation through to our customers.A failure in our operational information systems or cyber security attacks on any of our facilities, or those of third parties, may adversely affect our financial results.Our business is heavily supported by operational systems to process large amounts of data and support complex transactions. If significant financial, operational, or other data processing systems fail, are attacked by intruders or have other significant shortcomings, our financial results could be adversely affected. Our financial results could also be adversely affected if an employee causes our operational systems to fail, either as a result of inadvertent error or by deliberately tampering with or manipulating our financial or operational systems. Due to increased technology advances, we are more reliant on technologies to support our operations. We use computer software and programs to run our financial and operational information, and this may subject our business to increased risks. Cyber-attacks are an ever increasing risk to companies. Any significant cyber security attacks that affect our facilities, our customers, or our key suppliers, or material financial data could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, cyber-attacks on our customers, suppliers and employee data may result in a financial loss, including potential fines for failure to safeguard data, and may negatively impact our reputation. Third-party systems on which we rely could also suffer operational system failure. Any of these occurrences could disrupt our business, result in potential liability or reputational damage or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial results.If we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, we may lose some of our competitive advantage. We possess intellectual property, which is instrumental in our ability to compete and grow our business. If our intellectual property rights are not adequately protected, we could lose our competitive advantage. There can be no assurance that our patent applications will result in patents being issued or that current or additional patents will afford protection against competitors. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret protection and contractual rights to establish and protect our intellectual property. Failure of our patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret protection, non-disclosure agreements and other measures to provide protection of our technology and our intellectual property rights could enable our competitors to more effectively compete with us and could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our trade secrets and proprietary know-how may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by others. No guarantee can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or manufacturing and service know-how and techniques, or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology.Product defects could increase our warranty costs, and could result in product liability claims.Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of our products and the products of third-party vendors which we use or resell.  Many of our products and solutions can be complex and include sophisticated and potentially sensitive electronic components. We have increasingly manufactured certain of those components and products in our own facilities.  Widespread product recalls could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, penalties, and lost sales due to the unavailability of a product for a period of time. We may also be liable if the use of any of our products causes harm and could suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us in excess of its insurance limits. We may not be able to obtain indemnity or reimbursement from our suppliers or other third parties for the warranty costs or liabilities associated with our supplier products. A significant product recall, warranty claim, or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our business reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our products.Risks Related to StrategyOur acquisition strategy involves a number of risks.We intend to pursue continued growth through acquiring the assets of target companies that will enable us to (i) expand our product and service offerings and (ii) increase our geographic footprint. We routinely review potential acquisitions. However, we may be unable to implement this growth strategy if we are not able to reach agreement on mutually acceptable terms. Moreover, our acquisition strategy involves certain risks, including: •risks and liabilities from our acquisitions that may not be discovered during the pre-acquisition due diligence process;•difficulties in the post acquisition integration of operations and systems;•the termination of relationships with key personnel and customers of the acquired company;•the potential failure to add additional employees to manage the increased volume of business;•additional post acquisition challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, financial reporting and legal compliance;14Table of Contents•a disruption of our ongoing business or an inability of our ongoing business to receive sufficient management attention; and•a failure to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated prior to acquisition.Future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available to us.We may be unsuccessful at implementing and generating internal growth from our Strategic Growth Initiatives.Our ability to generate internal growth will be affected by, among other factors, our ability to: •attract new customers, internationally and domestically;•integrate regulatory changes;•increase the number or size of projects performed for existing customers;•hire and retain employees; and•increase volume utilizing existing facilities.Many of the factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth through our initiatives may be beyond our control, and we cannot be certain that our strategies will be successful or that we will be able to generate cash flow sufficient to fund our operations and to support internal growth. If we are unsuccessful, we may not be able to achieve internal growth, expand our operations or grow our business.The departure of key personnel could disrupt our business.We depend on the continued efforts of our executive officers and senior management team. We cannot be certain that any individual will continue in such capacity for any particular period of time. The future loss of key personnel, or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees, could negatively impact our ability to manage our business.Risks Related to Legal Liability and Regulations Actual and potential claims, lawsuits, and proceedings could ultimately reduce our profitability and liquidity and negatively impact our financial condition.The Company could be named as a defendant in legal proceedings claiming damages from us in connection with the operation of our business. Most actions filed against our Company typically arise out of the normal course of business related to commercial disputes regarding equipment we manufacture or services we provide. We could potentially be a plaintiff in legal proceedings against our customers, in which we seek to recover payments of contractual amounts we believe are due to us, and indemnity claims for increased costs or damages incurred by our Company. Under applicable accounting literature, and when appropriate, we establish financial provisions for certain legal exposures meeting the criteria of being both probable and reasonably estimable. Where material, we may adjust any such financial provisions from time to time depending on developments related to each case. If our assumptions and estimates related to such exposures prove to be inadequate or incorrect, or we have material adverse claims or lawsuits, they could harm our business reputation, divert management resources away from operating our business, and result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.Our operations could be adversely impacted by the effects of future changes to the law and government regulations regarding emissions, the global environment and other sustainability matters.Various regulations have been implemented regarding emissions, the global environment and other sustainability matters. We cannot predict future changes in the law and government regulations regarding emissions, the global environment and other sustainability matters, or what actions may be taken by our customers or other industry participants in response to any future legislation. While the Company actively is engaged in building our environmental, social and governance programs, changes in laws or governmental regulations could negatively impact our business or the demand for our products and services by customers, other industry related participants, or our investors, and could result in a negative impact to our operations, profitability, or our ability to perform projects in the future.Changes to U.S. trade policy, tariff and import/export regulations and foreign government regulations could adversely affect our business, operating results, foreign operations, sourcing and financial condition.Changes in U.S. or international social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories or countries where we currently manufacture, distribute and/or sell our products or conduct our business, as well as any negative sentiment toward the U.S. as a result of such 15Table of Contentschanges, could adversely affect our business. New tariffs, changes in existing tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy have the potential to adversely impact the economies in which we operate or certain sectors thereof, our industry and the global demand for our products, and as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.  In addition, we cannot predict the full impact trade policy changes that have been asserted by the new U.S. presidential administration and Congress, including anticipated changes to current trade policies will be maintained or modified or whether the entry into new bilateral or multilateral trade agreements will occur, nor can we accurately predict the effects that any changes will have on our future business.Our business is also subject to risks associated with U.S. and foreign legislation and regulations relating to imports, including quotas, duties, tariffs or taxes, and other charges or restrictions on imports, which could adversely affect our operations and our ability to import or export products at current or increased levels, and substantially all of our import operations are subject to customs duties on imported products imposed by the governments where our production facilities are located, including raw materials. With the recent change in administration, we cannot predict whether additional U.S. and foreign customs quotas, duties (including antidumping or countervailing duties), tariffs, taxes or other charges or restrictions, requirements as to where raw materials must be purchased, reporting obligations pertaining to “conflict minerals” mined from certain countries, additional workplace regulations, or other restrictions on our imports will be imposed upon the importation or exportation of our products in the future or adversely modified, or what effect such actions would have on our costs of operations. Future quotas, duties, or tariffs may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Future trade agreements could also provide our competitors with an advantage over us, or increase our costs, either of which could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Regulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business.Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, which established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for publicly-traded companies that use tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold (collectively, “conflict minerals”) mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in their products, we are subject to certain annual disclosures and audit requirements. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including costs for due diligence to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes, or sources of supply. Despite our continued due diligence efforts, in the future we may be unable to verify the origin of all conflict minerals used in our component products. As a result, we could potentially face reputational and other challenges with our customers that require that all of the components incorporated in our products be certified as conflict-free.Adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations could make it easier for our employees to obtain union representation and our business could be adversely impacted.As of February 28, 2021, approximately 868 of our variable workforce employees were represented by unions. Our U.S. based employees have the right at any time under the National Labor Relations Act to form or affiliate with a union. If a large portion of our workforce were to become unionized and the terms of the collective bargaining agreement were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements, it could increase our operating costs and adversely impact our profitability. Any changes in regulations, the imposition of new regulations, or the enactment of new legislation could have an adverse impact on our business to the extent it becomes easier for workers to obtain union representation.Changes in labor or employment laws, including minimum wage rules or COVID-19 benefits, could increase our costs and may adversely affect our business.Various federal, state and international labor and employment laws govern our relationship with employees and affect operating costs.  These laws include minimum wage requirements, overtime, unemployment tax rates, workers’ compensation rates, leaves of absence, mandated health and other benefits, and citizenship requirements.  Significant additional government-imposed increases or new requirements in these areas could materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows.Risks Related to Environmental ConditionsClimate change could impact our business.Climate changes could result in an adverse impact on our operations, particularly in hurricane prone or low lying areas near the ocean or heavy snowfall and ice regions. We cannot predict the potential timing or impact from potential global warming, winter storms and other natural disasters.  We carry certain limits of insurance to mitigate the potential effects of events that could impact our businesses, as well as disaster recovery plans related to any potential natural disasters that might occur within regions in which we have operations, or at any of the Company locations.16Table of ContentsChanges in environmental laws and regulations and heightened focus on corporate sustainability initiatives and practices are under increased scrutiny by both governmental and non-governmental bodies, which could cause a change in our business practices by increasing capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs, which could impact our future operating results.Over the past year there has been a heightened focus by both governmental and non-governmental bodies requesting disclosure of information relating to our corporate sustainable practices as well as customers are increasingly preferring to source from suppliers who have implemented effective sustainability initiatives. International agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions and require companies to more efficiently use energy, water and reduce waste, are in various stages of discussion and/or implementation across the globe. These laws, regulations and policies, as well other sustainability demands made by governmental and non-governmental bodies may result in the need for future capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs. We cannot predict the level of expenditures or potential impact to the Company that may be required to comply with these evolving environmental and sustainability laws and regulations due to the uncertainties on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction in which we operate, and our activities in each one of these jurisdictions.The financial impact of the heightened focus on sustainability practices for all companies to increase efficiencies in consumption of resources and future regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions will depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to:•the sectors covered;•future permitted levels for greenhouse gas emissions;•the extent to which we would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to invest in additional compliance equipment or compliance instruments, either on the open market or through auctions; •the price and availability of emission allowances and credits; and •the impact of legislation or other regulation on our ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of our products and services.Risks Related to Financial MattersOur use of over time revenue accounting in the Infrastructure Solutions segment could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits.As discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,” in our Critical Audit Matters in our financial statements, and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, portions of our sales are recognized over time. Over time revenue recognition causes us to recognize contract sales and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs. The earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract sales, costs and profitability. Contract losses are recognized in full at the time a recognized project loss is expected, and contract profit estimates are adjusted based on ongoing reviews of contract profitability. Actual collection of contract amounts, including the impacts of change orders, could differ from originally estimated amounts and could result in adjustments to sales, earnings, or both. In certain circumstances, it is possible that such adjustments could be significant.Our volume of fixed-price contracts for our Infrastructure Solutions segment could adversely affect our business.We currently generate, and expect to continue to generate, a significant portion of our sales under fixed price contracts. In these types of contractual arrangements, we estimate the costs of completing a particular project in order to make our fixed-price proposal under these type of contracts. The actual cost of labor and materials, however, are likely to vary from originally estimated project expenditures. Based upon the size of a particular project, variations from estimated cost to actually incurred costs could have a significant impact on our operating results in a given quarter or year.We may not be able to fully realize the sales value reported in our backlog for our Infrastructure Solutions segment. Due to the lead time required to design, procure and manufacture products or provide forward-looking services, primarily in our Infrastructure Solutions segment, we receive orders and maintain a backlog of future work.  Orders included in our backlog are supported by customer purchase orders or contracts, often supported under Master Service Agreements, which we believe to be firm orders.  Backlog develops as a result of new business secured, which represents the contractual value of new project commitments received by us during a given period. Backlog consists of orders which have either (1) not been started or (2) are in progress and are not yet complete. In the latter case, the revenue value reported in backlog is the remaining value associated with work that has not yet been completed, which can vary depending on whether the contract is over-time, or at a 17Table of Contentspoint in time. Orders recorded as new business or new backlog can sometimes be cancelled. In the event of cancellation, we are often reimbursed for incurred costs plus a margin on those costs, but typically have no contractual right to the total sales reflected in our backlog. In addition to being unable to recover certain direct costs, we could also incur additional costs resulting from underutilized facilities if orders are cancelled.The Company’s flexibility to operate its business could be impacted by provisions in its debt obligations.The Company’s debt instruments, consisting of senior notes and a revolving credit facility, contain covenants which restrict or prohibit certain actions (“negative covenants”), including, but not limited to, the Company's ability to incur debt, restrict or limit certain liens, capital spending limits, engage in certain merger, acquisition, or divestiture actions, or increase dividends beyond a specific level. The Company’s  debt instruments also contain covenants requiring the Company to, among other things, maintain specified financial ratios (“affirmative covenants”). Failure to comply with these negative covenants and affirmative covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could restrict the Company’s access to liquidity and have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business or prospects. If the Company does not have enough cash to service its debt or fund other liquidity needs, the Company may be required to take actions such as requesting a waiver from lenders, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing all or part of the existing debt, or seeking additional equity capital.  The Company cannot assure that any of these remedies can be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all.We could face significant liabilities for withdrawal from Multiemployer Pension Plans.The Company is a participating employer in a number of trustee-managed multiemployer defined benefit pension plans for employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In the event of our withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan, we may incur costs associated with our obligations for unfunded vested benefits at the time of the withdrawal. Depending on various factors, a future withdrawal could have a material adverse effect on results of operations or cash flows for a particular reporting period.A change in a customer’s creditworthiness could result in significant accounts receivable write-offs.As a normal course of business, we extend credit to certain of our customers. The amount of credit extended to customers is based upon the due diligence performed, including, but not limited to, the review of the potential customer’s financial statements and banking information.  The Company may perform various credit checks, and evaluate previous payment history.  While we do not believe we have significant concentration of sales with any one customer, we have certain larger customers, which could result in a significant amount of credit exposure if there is a sudden or severe change in the customer’s creditworthiness. We monitor our outstanding receivables on a regular basis; however, if a customer with large credit exposure is unable to make payment on its outstanding receivables, we could experience a significant write-off of accounts receivable.If our goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets were to become impaired, our net income and results of operations could be negatively affected.Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Indefinite-lived intangibles are comprised of certain tradenames, customer relationships, and other intangible assets. We test goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life for potential impairment annually, in the fourth quarter, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the Company below its carrying amount.  Factors that could indicate that our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, lower than projected operating results and cash flows and economic downturns or slower growth rates in our industry, market downturns or major events like a global pandemic. Our stock price historically has shown volatility and often fluctuates significantly in response to market and other factors. Declines in our stock price, lower operating results and any decline in industry conditions in the future could increase the risk of impairment. The evaluation for impairment includes our estimates of future operating results and cash flows, estimates of allocations of certain assets and cash flows among reporting segments, estimates of future growth rates, and our judgment regarding the applicable discount rates used on estimated operating results and cash flows.Should a review indicate impairment, a write-down of the carrying value of the goodwill or intangible asset would occur, resulting in a non-cash charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements, impact our creditability with our shareholders, or impact our relationships with our customers, suppliers or supporting banks. We are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations in the international markets in which we operate.We operate in international countries and anticipate that there will be instances in which sales and costs will not be exactly matched with respect to foreign currency denomination. Gains and losses from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities that 18Table of Contentsare receivable or payable in currencies other than our subsidiaries’ functional currency are included in our consolidated statements of income. In addition, currency fluctuations cause the U.S. dollar value of our international results of operations and net assets to vary with exchange rate fluctuations. A decrease in the value of any of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. As we continue to expand geographically, we could experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings or net assets solely as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In the future, we may utilize derivative instruments to manage the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that could potentially impact our future earnings and forecasted cash flows. However, the markets in which we operate could restrict the removal or conversion of the local or foreign currency, resulting in our inability to hedge against some or all of these risks or increase our cost of conversion of local currency to U.S. dollar.Our operations entail inherent risks that may result in substantial liability. We do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities.Our manufacturing processes and services provided to our customers entail inherent risks, including equipment defects, malfunctions and failures.  The insurance we carry to mitigate many of these risks may not be adequate to cover future claims or losses. In addition, we are substantially self-insured for workers’ compensation, employer’s liability, property, general liability and employee group health claims in view of the relatively high per-incident deductibles we absorb under our insurance arrangements for these risks. Further, insurance covering the risks we expect to face or in the amounts we desire may not be available in the future or, if available, the premiums may not be commercially justifiable. If we were to incur substantial liability and such damages were not covered by insurance or were in excess of policy limits, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.Tax legislation and administrative initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We operate in locations throughout the U.S. and internationally and, as a result, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign governments. From time to time, various legislative or administrative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions. In addition, U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Moreover, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving any future tax disputes favorably more difficult. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge. Changes to our tax positions resulting from future tax legislation and administrative initiatives or challenges from taxing authorities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Changes in the method pursuant to which the LIBOR rates are determined and potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may adversely affect our results of operations.LIBOR and certain other “benchmarks” are the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. In particular, on July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee consisting of large U.S. financial institutions convened by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has recommended replacing LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), an index supported by short-term Treasury repurchase agreements. On November 30, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration (“IBA”), the administrator of USD LIBOR announced that it does not intend to cease publication of the remaining USD LIBOR tenors until June 30, 2023, providing additional time for existing contracts that are dependent on LIBOR to mature. It is unclear whether, at that time, LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established. As of February 28, 2021, $29.0 million of the borrowings under our revolving credit facility had interest rate payments determined directly or indirectly based on LIBOR. Any uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate could adversely affect the performance of LIBOR relative to its historic values. If the methods of calculating LIBOR change from current methods for any reason, or if LIBOR ceases to perform as it has historically, our interest expense associated with our outstanding indebtedness or any future indebtedness we incur may increase. Further, when LIBOR ceases to exist, we may be forced to substitute an alternative reference rate under our revolving credit facility or rely on base rate borrowings in lieu of LIBOR-based borrowings. Although SOFR appears to be the preferred replacement rate for USD LIBOR, it is unclear if other benchmarks may emerge or if other rates will be adopted outside of the U.S. Any such alternative reference rate may increase the interest expense associated with our existing or future indebtedness. Any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our borrowing costs, business and results of operations.19Table of ContentsWe may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future, which could affect our financial condition, may decrease our profitability or could dilute our shareholders.We may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future, subject to restrictions in our debt agreements. If our cash flow from operations is less than we anticipate, or if our cash requirements are more than we expect, we may require more financing. However, debt or equity financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of preferred stock, the terms of the debt or preferred stock issued may give the holders rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, particularly in the event of liquidation. The terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have. If we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity, our shareholders’ ownership in us would be diluted. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, it could affect our financial health, which could negatively affect our shareholders.General Risks FactorsThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.The market price of our stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:•the inability to meet the financial estimates of analysts who follow our common stock;•strategic actions by us or our competitors;•announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;•variations in our quarterly operating results and those of our competitors;•general economic and stock market conditions;•risks relating to our business and our industry, including those discussed above;•changes in conditions or trends in our industry, markets or customers;•cyber-attacks, terrorist acts or armed hostilities;•future sales of our common stock or other securities;•repurchases of our outstanding shares;•material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting; and•investor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our Company relative to other investment alternatives.These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our common stock is low. 20Table of Contents"
16,AZZ,AZZ INC,2020-04-29,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
Our business is subject to a variety of risks, including but not limited to the risks described below, which we believe are the most significant risks and uncertainties facing our business. Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or not described below may also impair our business operations in the future. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations and future growth could be negatively or materially impacted.Our business segments operate in highly competitive markets.Many of our competitors, primarily in our Energy Segment, are significantly larger and have substantially more resources than AZZ. Competition is based on a number of factors, including price. Certain of our competitors may have lower cost structures and may, therefore, be able to provide their products and services at lower prices than we are able to provide. We cannot be certain that our competitors will not develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services or products that are superior in price, delivery time or quality in the future. Similarly, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position within our industries, maintain our customer base at current levels or increase our customer base.Our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.Our quarterly results may be materially and adversely affected by: •the timing and volume of work under new or existing agreements;•general economic conditions;•fluctuations in the budgetary spending of customers, including seasonality;•variations in the margins of projects performed during any particular quarter;•losses experienced in our operations not otherwise covered by insurance;•delays of raw materials or component suppliers;•a change in the demand or production of our products and our services caused by severe weather conditions;•a change in the mix of our customers, contracts and business;•changes in customer delivery schedules;•unstable political economic conditions and public health issues delaying customer operations;•increases in design, manufacturing or transportation costs; and•the ability of customers to pay their invoices when owed to us.Accordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results expected for any other quarter or for the entire year.We may be unsuccessful at implementing and generating internal growth from our Strategic Growth Initiatives.Our ability to generate internal growth will be affected by, among other factors, our ability to: •attract new customers, internationally and domestically;•integrate regulatory changes;•increase the number or size of projects performed for existing customers;•hire and retain employees; and•increase volume utilizing our existing facilities.Many of the factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth through our initiatives may be beyond our control, and we cannot be certain that our strategies will be successful or that we will be able to generate cash flow sufficient to fund our operations and to support internal growth. If we are unsuccessful, we may not be able to achieve internal growth, expand our operations or grow our business.The departure of key personnel could disrupt our business.We depend on the continued efforts of our executive officers and senior management team. We cannot be certain that any individual will continue in such capacity for any particular period of time. The future loss of key personnel, or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees, could negatively impact our ability to manage our business.8Table of ContentsOur business requires skilled labor, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees.Our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability could be limited by an inability to employ, train and retain skilled personnel necessary to meet our labor requirements. We may experience shortages of qualified personnel. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an adequately skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy or that our labor expense will not increase as a result of shortage in the supply of skilled personnel. Labor shortages or increased labor costs could impair our ability to maintain our profit margins or sustain and grow our revenues.Actual and potential claims, lawsuits, and proceedings could ultimately reduce our profitability and liquidity and negatively impact our financial condition.In the future, the Company could be named as a defendant in legal proceedings claiming damages from us in connection with the operation of our business. Most of the actions against us arise out of the normal course of business related to commercial disputes regarding the equipment we manufacture or the services we provide. We could potentially be a plaintiff in legal proceedings against customers, in which we seek to recover payments of contractual amounts due to us, and indemnity claims for increased costs or damages incurred by our Company. When appropriate, we establish provisions against certain legal exposures, and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to ongoing developments related to each case. If in the future our assumptions and estimates related to such exposures prove to be inadequate or incorrect, or we have material adverse claims or lawsuits, they could harm our business reputation, divert management resources away from operating our business, and result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.Technological innovations by competitors may make existing products and production methods obsolete.All of the manufactured products and services sold by the Company depend upon the best available technology for success in the marketplace. The competitive environment is highly sensitive to technological innovation in both segments of our business. It is possible for our competitors, both foreign and domestic, to develop new products, production methods or technology which would make our current products, services or methods obsolete or at least hasten their obsolescence or materially reduce our competitive advantage in the markets that we serve.Catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.The occurrence of catastrophic events ranging from acts of war and terrorism, natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, or the outbreaks of epidemic, pandemic or contagious diseases such as the recent novel coronavirus, could potentially cause disruptions in our business. These disruptions could include the temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers or suppliers and their contract manufacturers, which could restrict to our ability to complete projects on schedule.  Any disruption of our customers or suppliers and their contract manufacturers could likely impact our sales and operating results.  In addition, continued pandemic, or the spread of any other contagious diseases could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, and result in an economic downturn that could affect the demand for our products and services.  These situations are outside of the Company’s control and any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.Our operations could be adversely impacted by the effects of future changes to the law and government regulations regarding emissions, the global environment and other sustainability matters.Various regulations have been implemented regarding emissions, the global environment and other sustainability matters. We cannot predict future changes in the law and government regulations regarding emissions, the global environment and other sustainability matters, ,  or what actions may be taken by our customers or other industry participants in response to any future legislation. Such changes in the laws,  governmental regulations could negatively impact our business or the demand for our products and services by customers and other industry related participants, and could result in a negative impact to our operations, or profitability, or our ability to perform projects in any respective  regions.  Federal, state and local governments have a major impact on the framework and economics of the US nuclear power industry.  Changes in laws or regulations regarding the operations of current nuclear facilities could have an impact on the demand for our products and services, which would have a negative impact on our operations. These same risks are also associated with foreign nuclear power industries.9Table of ContentsNew regulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business.In August 2012, the SEC adopted a rule pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act which established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for publicly-traded companies that use tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold (collectively, “conflict minerals”) mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in their products. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including costs for due diligence to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes, or sources of supply. Despite our continued due diligence efforts, in the future we may be unable to verify the origin of all conflict minerals used in our component products. As a result, we could potentially face reputational and other challenges with customers that require that all of the components incorporated in our products be certified as conflict-free.Our acquisition strategy involves a number of risks.We intend to pursue continued growth through acquiring the assets of target companies that will enable us to (i) expand our product and service offerings and (ii) increase our geographic footprint. We routinely review potential acquisitions. However, we may be unable to implement this growth strategy if we are not able to reach agreement on mutually acceptable terms. Moreover, our acquisition strategy involves certain risks, including: •risks and liabilities from our acquisitions that may not be discovered during the preacquisition due diligence process;•difficulties in the post acquisition integration of operations and systems;•the termination of relationships with key personnel and customers of the acquired company;•the potential failure to add additional employees to manage the increased volume of business;•additional post acquisition challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, financial reporting and legal compliance;•a disruption of our ongoing business or an inability of our ongoing business to receive sufficient management attention; and•a failure to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated or modeled prior to acquisition.Future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available to us.Our business segments are sensitive to economic downturns.If the general level of economic activity deteriorates from current levels, our customers may delay or cancel new projects. If there is a reduction in demand for our products or services, as a result of a downturn in the general economy, there could be a material adverse effect on price levels and the quantity of goods and services purchased, therefore adversely impacting our revenues, consolidated results from operations and cash flows. A number of factors, including financing conditions and potential bankruptcies in the industries we serve, could adversely affect our customers and their ability or willingness to fund capital expenditures in the future and pay for services or equipment. Certain economic conditions may also impact the financial condition of one or more of our key suppliers, which could affect our ability to secure raw materials and components to meet our customers’ demand for our products in the future. Other various factors drive demand for our products and services, including the price of oil, economic forecasts and financial markets. Uncertainty in the global economy and financial markets could impact our customers and could in turn severely impact the demand for corporate infrastructure projects that would result in a reduction in orders for our products and services. All of these factors combined together could materially impact our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and potentially impact the trading price of our common stock.International events and political issues may adversely affect our Energy and Metal Coatings segments.A portion of the revenues from our Energy and Metal Coatings segments are from international markets. The occurrence of any of the risks described below could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition: •political and economic instability in the countries we conduct business;•social unrest, acts of war and terrorism, natural disasters, and global outbreaks of contagious diseases;•inflation;•currency fluctuation, devaluations and conversion restrictions;•governmental activities that limit or disrupt markets, restrict payments or limit the movement of funds;•trade restrictions, tariffs and economic embargoes by the United States or other countries; and•travel restrictions placed upon personnel, limiting travel to install equipment or perform services for our customers10Table of ContentsFluctuations in the price and supply of raw materials and natural gas for our business segments may adversely affect our operations.In our Metal Coatings segment, zinc and natural gas represent a large portion of our cost of sales. The prices of zinc and natural gas are subject to volatility. We purchase a wide variety of raw materials for our Energy segment to manufacture our products, including copper, aluminum, steel and nickel. Unanticipated increases in raw material requirements or price increases could increase production costs and adversely affect profitability. The following factors, which are beyond our control, affect the price of raw materials and natural gas for our business segments: supply and demand; freight costs and transportation availability; trade duties and taxes; and labor disputes. We seek to maintain operating margins by attempting to increase the price of our products and services in response to increased costs, but may not be successful in passing these price increases through to our customersClimate change could impact our business.Climate changes could result in an adverse impact on our operations, particularly in hurricane prone or low lying areas near the ocean. At this time, the Company is not able to speculate as to the potential timing or impact from potential global warming and other natural disasters, however the Company believes that it currently has adequate insurance coverage and disaster recovery plans related to any potential natural disasters that might occur at any of the Company’s sites.Changes in greenhouse gas regulations could impact our operating results.International agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are currently in various stages of discussion or implementation. These and other greenhouse gas emissions-related laws, policies and regulations may result in substantial capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs. The level of expenditure required to comply with these laws and regulations is uncertain and is expected to vary depending on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction, our activities in the particular jurisdiction, and market conditions.The effect of regulation on our financial performance will depend on a number of factors including, not limited to, the sectors covered, the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required by law, the extent to which we would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits and the impact of legislation or other regulation on our ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of our products and services.Our volume of fixed-price contracts for our Energy segment could adversely affect our business.We currently generate, and expect to continue to generate, a significant portion of our revenues under fixed price contracts. We must estimate the costs of completing a particular project to bid for fixed-price contracts. The actual cost of labor and materials, however, may vary from the costs we originally estimated. Depending on the size of a particular project, variations from estimated cost could have a significant impact on our operating results for any fiscal year.Our use of over time revenue accounting in the Energy segment could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits.As discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, a portion of our revenues is recognized over time. Over time revenue recognition causes us to recognize contract revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs. The earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenues, costs and profitability. Contract losses are recognized in full when determined, and contract profit estimates are adjusted based on ongoing reviews of contract profitability. Actual collection of contract amounts or change orders could differ from original estimated amounts and could result in a reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings. In certain circumstances, it is possible that such adjustments could be significant.We may not be able to fully realize the revenue value reported in our backlog for our Energy segment.We maintain a backlog of work in our Energy segment due to the lead time required to design, procure and manufacture our Energy products or services. Orders included in our backlog are represented by customer purchase orders and contracts, which we believe to be firm. Backlog develops as a result of new business secured, which represents the contractual value of new project commitments received by us during a given period. Backlog consists of orders which have either (1) not been started or (2) are in progress and are not yet complete. In the latter case, the revenue value reported in backlog is the remaining value associated with work that has not yet been completed. From time to time, orders recorded as new business or new backlog are cancelled. In the event cancellation, we are often reimbursed for certain costs and the margin on those costs, but typically have no contractual right to the total revenue reflected in our backlog. In addition to being unable to recover certain direct costs, we may also incur additional costs resulting from underutilized assets if orders are cancelled.11Table of ContentsAdoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations could make it easier for our employees to obtain union representation and our business could be adversely impacted.Other than a nominal number of employees at four of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, none of our employees are currently represented by unions. However, our U.S. based employees have the right at any time under the National Labor Relations Act to form or affiliate with a union. If a large portion of our workforce were to become unionized and the terms of the collective bargaining agreement were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements, it could increase our operating costs and adversely impact our profitability. Any changes in regulations, the imposition of new regulations, or the enactment of new legislation could have an adverse impact on our business; to the extent it becomes easier for workers to obtain union representation.AZZ’s flexibility to operate its business could be impacted by provisions in its debt obligations.AZZ’s debt instruments contain covenants which restrict or prohibit certain actions (“negative covenants”), including, but not limited to, the Company's ability to incur debt, create or suffer to exist liens, capital spending limits, engage in certain merger, acquisition, or divestiture actions, or increase dividends beyond a specific level. AZZ’s debt instruments also contain covenants requiring AZZ to, among other things, maintain specified financial ratios (“affirmative covenants”). Failure to comply with these negative covenants and affirmative covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could restrict the Company’s access to liquidity and have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business or prospects. If the Company does not have  enough cash to service its debt or fund other liquidity needs, AZZ may be required to take actions such as requesting a waiver from lenders, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing all or part of the existing debt, or seeking additional equity capital. AZZ cannot assure that any of these remedies can be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all.A failure in our operational systems or cyber security attacks on any of our facilities, or those of third parties, mayaffect adversely our financial results. Our business is dependent upon our operational systems to process a large amount of data and complex transactions. If any of our financial, operational, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, our financial results could be adversely affected. Our financial results could also be adversely affected if an employee causes our operational systems to fail, either as a result of inadvertent error or by deliberately tampering with or manipulating our operational systems. Due to increased technology advances, we have become more reliant on technology to help increase efficiency in our business. We use computer programs to help run our financial and operations sectors, and this may subject our business to increased risks. Any future cyber security attacks that affect our facilities, our customers and any financial data could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, cyber attacks on our customers, suppliers and employee data may result in a financial loss, including potential fines for failure to safeguard data, and may negatively impact our reputation. Third-party systems on which we rely could also suffer operational system failure. Any of these occurrences could disrupt our business, result in potential liability or reputational damage or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial results.We could face significant liabilities for withdrawal from Multiemployer Pension Plans.We are a participating employer in a number of trustee-managed multiemployer defined benefit pension plans for employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In the event of our withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan, we may incur expenses associated with our obligations for unfunded vested benefits at the time of the withdrawal. Depending on various factors, a future withdrawal could have a material adverse effect on results of operations or cash flows for a particular reporting period. We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, adversely affect investor confidence in our company, the value of our common stock and our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner. Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting and to provide a report of management’s assessment of the effectiveness of such controls. The Company had a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting as of February 29, 2020 related to the accounting for income taxes. Although we are working to fully remediate this material weakness, there can be no assurance as to when the remediation plan will be fully implemented and executed. Any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that has not been remediated or that may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our consolidated financial statements, restatements of those financial statements, a decline in our stock price, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. 12Table of Contents"
2,AZZ,AZZ INC,2019-05-17,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
Our business is subject to a variety of risks, including but not limited to the risks described below, which we believe are the most significant risks and uncertainties facing our business. Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or not described below may also impair our business operations in the future. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations and future growth could be negatively impacted.Our business segments operate in highly competitive markets.Many of our competitors, primarily in our Energy Segment, are significantly larger and have substantially more resources than AZZ. Competition is based on a number of factors, including price. Certain of our competitors may have lower cost structures and may, therefore, be able to provide their products and services at lower prices than we are able to provide. We cannot be certain that our competitors will not develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both price and quality in the future. Similarly, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position within our industries, maintain our customer base at current levels or increase our customer base.Climate change could impact our business.Climate changes could result in an adverse impact on AZZ's operations, particularly in hurricane prone or low lying areas near the ocean. At this time, the Company is not able to speculate as to the potential timing or impact from potential global warming and other natural disasters, however the Company believes that it currently has adequate insurance coverage and disaster recovery plans related to any potential natural disasters that might occur at any of the Company’s sites.Changes in greenhouse gas regulations could impact our operating results.International agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are currently in various stages of discussion or implementation. These and other greenhouse gas emissions-related laws, policies and regulations may result in substantial capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs. The level of expenditure required to comply with these laws and regulations is uncertain and is expected to vary depending on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction, our activities in the particular jurisdiction, and market conditions.The effect of regulation on our financial performance will depend on a number of factors including, not limited to, the sectors covered, the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required by law, the extent to which we would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits and the impact of legislation or other regulation on our ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of our products and services.Our business segments are sensitive to economic downturns.If the general level of economic activity deteriorates from current levels, our customers may delay or cancel new projects. If there is a reduction in demand for our products or services, as a result of a downturn in the general economy, there could be a material adverse effect on price levels and the quantity of goods and services purchased, therefore adversely impacting revenues and results from operations. A number of factors, including financing conditions and potential bankruptcies in the industries we serve, could adversely affect our customers and their ability or willingness to fund capital expenditures in the future and pay for past services. Certain economic conditions may also impact the financial condition of one or more of our key suppliers, which could affect our ability to secure raw materials and components to meet our customers’ demand for our products in the future. Other various factors drive demand for our products and services, including the price of oil, economic forecasts and financial markets. Uncertainty in the global economy and financial markets could continue to impact our customers and could in turn severely impact the demand for spending projects that would result in a reduction in orders for our products and services. All of these factors combined together could materially impact our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and potentially impact the trading price of our common stock.International and political events may adversely affect our Energy and Metal Coatings Segments.A portion of the revenues from our Energy and Metal Coatings Segments are from international markets. The occurrence of any of the risks described below could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition: •political and economic instability, such as is occurring in Northern Africa, Europe and the Middle East;•social unrest, acts of terrorism, force majeure, war or other armed conflict;•inflation;•currency fluctuation, devaluations and conversion restrictions;7Table of Contents•governmental activities that limit or disrupt markets, restrict payments or limit the movement of funds; and•trade restrictions and economic embargoes by the United States or other countries.Fluctuations in the price and supply of raw materials and natural gas for our business segments may adversely affect our operations.We purchase a wide variety of raw materials for our Energy Segment to manufacture our products, including copper, aluminum, steel and nickel. Unanticipated increases in raw material requirements or price increases could increase production costs and adversely affect profitability. In our Metal Coatings Segment, zinc and natural gas represent a large portion of our cost of sales. The prices of zinc and natural gas are subject to volatility. The following factors, which are beyond our control, affect the price of raw materials and natural gas for our business segments: supply and demand; freight costs and transportation availability; trade duties and taxes; and labor disputes. We seek to maintain operating margins by attempting to increase the price of our products and services in response to increased costs, but may not be successful in passing these price increases through to our customers.Our volume of fixed-price contracts for our Energy Segment could adversely affect our business.We currently generate, and expect to continue to generate, a significant portion of our revenues under fixed price contracts. We must estimate the costs of completing a particular project to bid for fixed-price contracts. The actual cost of labor and materials, however, may vary from the costs we originally estimated. Depending on the size of a particular project, variations from estimated cost could have a significant impact on our operating results for any fiscal year.Our operations could be adversely impacted by the continuing effects from government regulations. Various regulations have been implemented related to new safety and certification requirements applicable to oil and gas drilling and production activities. While certain new drilling plans and drilling permits have been approved, we cannot predict whether operators will be able to satisfy these requirements. Further, we cannot predict what the continuing effects of government regulations on offshore deepwater drilling projects may have on offshore oil and gas exploration and development activity, or what actions may be taken by our customers or other industry participants in response to these regulations. Changes in laws or regulations regarding offshore oil and gas exploration and development activities and decisions by customers and other industry participants could reduce demand for our services, which would have a negative impact on our operations. Similarly, we cannot accurately predict future regulations by the government in any country in which we operate and how those regulations may affect our ability to perform projects in those regions. Federal, state and local governments have a major impact on the framework and economics of the US nuclear power industry.  Changes in laws or regulations regarding the operations of current nuclear facilities could have an impact on the demand for our products and services, which would have a negative impact on our operations. These same risks are also associated with foreign nuclear power industries.New regulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business.On August 22, 2012, the SEC adopted a rule pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act which established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for publicly-traded companies that use tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold (collectively, “conflict minerals”) mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in their products. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including costs for due diligence to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes, or sources of supply. Despite our due diligence efforts, we may be unable to verify the origin of all conflict minerals used in our component products. As a result, we may face reputational and other challenges with customers that require that all of the components incorporated in our products be certified as conflict-free.Our acquisition strategy involves a number of risks.We intend to pursue continued growth through opportunities to acquire companies or assets that will enable us to expand our product and service offerings and to increase our geographic footprint. We routinely review potential acquisitions. However, we may be unable to implement this growth strategy if we cannot reach agreement on potential strategic acquisitions on acceptable terms or for other reasons. Moreover, our acquisition strategy involves certain risks, including: •difficulties in the post acquisition integration of operations and systems;•the termination of relationships with key personnel and customers of the acquired company;•a failure to add additional employees to manage the increased volume of business;•additional post acquisition challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, financial reporting and legal compliance;8Table of Contents•risks and liabilities from our acquisitions, some of which may not be discovered during the preacquisition due diligence process;•a disruption of our ongoing business or an inability of our ongoing business to receive sufficient management attention; and•a failure to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated prior to acquisition.Future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on current attractive market terms.Our use of over time revenue accounting in the Energy Segment could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits.As discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, a portion of our revenues is recognized over time. Over time revenue recognition causes us to recognize contract revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs. The earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenues, costs and profitability. Contract losses are recognized in full when determined, and contract profit estimates are adjusted based on ongoing reviews of contract profitability. Actual collection of contract amounts or change orders could differ from original estimated amounts and could result in a reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings. In certain circumstances, it is possible that such adjustments could be significant.We may not be able to fully realize the revenue value reported in our backlog for our Energy Segment.We have a backlog of work in our Energy Segment. Orders included in our backlog are represented by customer purchase orders and contracts, which we believe to be firm. Backlog develops as a result of new business secured, which represents the revenue value of new project commitments received by us during a given period. Backlog consists of projects which have either (1) not been started or (2) are in progress and are not yet complete. In the latter case, the revenue value reported in backlog is the remaining value associated with work that has not yet been completed. From time to time, projects that were recorded as new business are cancelled. In the event of a project cancellation, we may be reimbursed for certain costs but typically have no contractual right to the total revenue reflected in our backlog. In addition to being unable to recover certain direct costs, we may also incur additional costs resulting from underutilized assets if projects are cancelled.Our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.Our quarterly results may be materially and adversely affected by: •the timing and volume of work under new agreements;•general economic conditions;•the budgetary spending patterns of customers;•variations in the margins of projects performed during any particular quarter;•losses experienced in our operations not otherwise covered by insurance;•a change in the demand or production of our products and our services caused by severe weather conditions;•a change in the mix of our customers, contracts and business;•a change in customer delivery schedule;•increases in design and manufacturing costs; and•abilities of customers to pay their invoices owed to us.Accordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results expected for any other quarter or for the entire year.We may be unsuccessful at generating internal growth.Our ability to generate internal growth will be affected by, among other factors, our ability to: •attract new customers, internationally and domestically;•integrate regulatory changes;•increase the number or size of projects performed for existing customers;•hire and retain employees; and•increase volume utilizing our existing facilities.9Table of ContentsMany of the factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth may be beyond our control, and we cannot be certain that our strategies will be successful or that we will be able to generate cash flow sufficient to fund our operations and to support internal growth. If we are unsuccessful, we may not be able to achieve internal growth, expand our operations or grow our business.The departure of key personnel could disrupt our business.We depend on the continued efforts of our executive officers and senior management. We cannot be certain that any individual will continue in such capacity for any particular period of time. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees, could negatively impact our ability to manage our business.Our business requires skilled labor, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees.Our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability could be limited by an inability to employ, train and retain skilled personnel necessary to meet our requirements. We may experience shortages of qualified personnel. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an adequately skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy or that our labor expense will not increase as a result of shortage in the supply of skilled personnel. Labor shortages or increased labor costs could impair our ability to maintain our business or grow our revenues.Actual and potential claims, lawsuits, and proceedings could ultimately reduce our profitability and liquidity and weaken our financial condition.In the future, the Company could be named as a defendant in legal proceedings claiming damages from us in connection with the operation of our business. Most of the actions against us arise out of the normal course of our performing services or with respect to the equipment we manufacture. We could potentially be a plaintiff in legal proceedings against customers, in which we seek to recover payments of contractual amounts due to us, and claims for increased costs incurred by us. When appropriate, we establish provisions against certain legal exposures, and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to ongoing developments related to each exposure. If in the future our assumptions and estimates related to such exposures prove to be inadequate or incorrect, our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, claims, lawsuits and proceedings may harm our reputation and possibly divert management resources away from operating our business.Technological innovations by competitors may make existing products and production methods obsolete.All of the products manufactured and sold by the Company depend upon the best available technology for success in the marketplace. The competitive environment is highly sensitive to technological innovation in both segments of our business. It is possible for our competitors, both foreign and domestic, to develop new products or production methods, which will make current products or methods obsolete or at least hasten their obsolescence.Catastrophic events could disrupt our business.The occurrence of catastrophic events ranging from natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis or hurricanes to epidemics such as health epidemics to acts of war and terrorism could disrupt or delay our ability to complete projects and could potentially expose the Company to third-party liability claims. Such events may or may not be fully covered by our various insurance policies or may be subject to deductibles. In addition, such events could impact our customers and suppliers, resulting in temporary or long-term delays and/or cancellations of orders or raw materials used in normal business operations. These situations are outside the Company’s control and could have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations.Adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations could make it easier for our employees to obtain union representation and our business could be adversely impacted.Other than a nominal number of employees at four of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, none of our employees are currently represented by unions. However, our U.S. based employees have the right at any time under the National Labor Relations Act to form or affiliate with a union. If some or our entire workforce were to become unionized and the terms of the collective bargaining agreement were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements, it could increase our costs and adversely impact our profitability. Any changes in regulations, the imposition of new regulations, or the enactment of new legislation could have an adverse impact on our business; to the extent it becomes easier for workers to obtain union representation.10Table of ContentsAZZ’s flexibility to operate its business could be impacted by provisions in its debt obligations.AZZ’s debt instruments contain covenants which restrict or prohibit certain actions (“negative covenants”), including, but not limited to, AZZ’s ability to incur debt, create or suffer to exist liens, capital spending limits, engage in certain merger, acquisition, or divestiture actions, or increase dividends beyond a specific level. AZZ’s debt instruments also contain covenants requiring AZZ to, among other things, maintain specified financial ratios (“affirmative covenants”). Failure to comply with these negative covenants and affirmative covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could restrict the Company’s access to liquidity and have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business or prospects. If the Company does not have  enough cash to service its debt or fund other liquidity needs, AZZ may be required to take actions such as requesting a waiver from lenders, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing all or part of the existing debt, or seeking additional equity capital. AZZ cannot assure that any of these remedies can be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all.A failure in our operational systems or cyber security attacks on any of our facilities, or those of third parties, mayaffect adversely our financial results. Our business is dependent upon our operational systems to process a large amount of data and complex transactions. If any of our financial, operational, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, our financial results could be adversely affected. Our financial results could also be adversely affected if an employee causes our operational systems to fail, either as a result of inadvertent error or by deliberately tampering with or manipulating our operational systems. Due to increased technology advances, we have become more reliant on technology to help increase efficiency in our business. We use computer programs to help run our financial and operations sectors, and this may subject our business to increased risks. Any future cyber security attacks that affect our facilities, our customers and any financial data could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, cyber attacks on our customer and employee data may result in a financial loss, including potential fines for failure to safeguard data, and may negatively impact our reputation. Third-party systems on which we rely could also suffer operational system failure. Any of these occurrences could disrupt our business, result in potential liability or reputational damage or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial results.We could face significant liabilities for withdrawal from Multiemployer Pension Plans.We are a participating employer in a number of trustee-managed multiemployer defined benefit pension plans for employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In the event of our withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan, we may incur expenses associated with our obligations for unfunded vested benefits at the time of the withdrawal. Depending on various factors, a future withdrawal could have a material adverse effect on results of operations or cash flows for a particular reporting period. Uncertainties in the interpretation and application of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate. The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “U.S. Tax Act”) requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the U.S. Tax Act, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant.  The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies will continue to interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the U.S. Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered.  As future guidance is issued, we may make adjustments to amounts that we have previously recorded that may materially impact our financial statements in the period in which the adjustments are made.We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, adversely affect investor confidence in our company, the value of our common stock and our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner. Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting and to provide a report of management’s assessment of the effectiveness of such controls. The Company had a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting as of February 28, 2019 related to revenue accounting reconciliations. Although we are working to fully remediate this material weakness identified as of February 28, 2019, there can be no assurance as to when the remediation plan will be fully implemented and executed. Any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that has not been remediated or that may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our consolidated financial statements, restatements of those financial statements, a decline in our stock price, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. 11Table of Contents"
15,AZZ,AZZ INC,2018-05-15,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
Our business is subject to a variety of risks, including but not limited to the risks described below, which we believe are the most significant risks and uncertainties facing our business. Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or not described below may also impair our business operations in the future. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations and future growth could be negatively impacted.Our business segments operate in highly competitive markets.Many of our competitors, primarily in our Energy Segment, are significantly larger and have substantially more resources than AZZ. Competition is based on a number of factors, including price. Certain of our competitors may have lower cost structures and may, therefore, be able to provide their products and services at lower prices than we are able to provide. We cannot be certain that our competitors will not develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both price and quality in the future. Similarly, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position within our industries, maintain our customer base at current levels or increase our customer base.Climate change could impact our business.Climate changes could result in an adverse impact on AZZ's operations, particularly in hurricane prone or low lying areas near the ocean. At this time, the Company is not able to speculate as to the potential timing or impact from potential global warming and other natural disasters, however the Company believes that it currently has adequate insurance coverage and disaster recovery plans related to any potential natural disasters that might occur at any of the Company’s sites.Changes in greenhouse gas regulations could impact our operating results.International agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are currently in various stages of discussion or implementation. These and other greenhouse gas emissions-related laws, policies and regulations may result in substantial capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs. The level of expenditure required to comply with these laws and regulations is uncertain and is expected to vary depending on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction, our activities in the particular jurisdiction, and market conditions.The effect of regulation on our financial performance will depend on a number of factors including, not limited to, the sectors covered, the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required by law, the extent to which we would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits and the impact of legislation or other regulation on our ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of our products and services.Our business segments are sensitive to economic downturns.If the general level of economic activity deteriorates from current levels, our customers may delay or cancel new projects. If there is a reduction in demand for our products or services, as a result of a downturn in the general economy, there could be a material adverse effect on price levels and the quantity of goods and services purchased, therefore adversely impacting revenues and results from operations. A number of factors, including financing conditions and potential bankruptcies in the industries we serve, could adversely affect our customers and their ability or willingness to fund capital expenditures in the future and pay for past services. Certain economic conditions may also impact the financial condition of one or more of our key suppliers, which could affect our ability to secure raw materials and components to meet our customers’ demand for our products in the future. Other various factors drive demand for our products and services, including the price of oil, economic forecasts and financial markets. Uncertainty in the global economy and financial markets could continue to impact our customers and could in turn severely impact the demand for spending projects that would result in a reduction in orders for our products and services. All of these factors combined together could materially impact our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and potentially impact the trading price of our common stock.International and political events may adversely affect our Energy and Metal Coatings Segments.A portion of the revenues from our Energy and Metal Coatings Segments are from international markets. The occurrence of any of the risks described below could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition: •political and economic instability, such as is occurring in Northern Africa, Europe and the Middle East;•social unrest, acts of terrorism, force majeure, war or other armed conflict;•inflation;•currency fluctuation, devaluations and conversion restrictions;7Table of Contents•governmental activities that limit or disrupt markets, restrict payments or limit the movement of funds; and•trade restrictions and economic embargoes by the United States or other countries.Fluctuations in the price and supply of raw materials and natural gas for our business segments may adversely affect our operations.We purchase a wide variety of raw materials for our Energy Segment to manufacture our products, including copper, aluminum, steel and nickel. Unanticipated increases in raw material requirements or price increases could increase production costs and adversely affect profitability. In our Metal Coatings Segment, zinc and natural gas represent a large portion of our cost of sales. The prices of zinc and natural gas are subject to volatility. The following factors, which are beyond our control, affect the price of raw materials and natural gas for our business segments: supply and demand; freight costs and transportation availability; trade duties and taxes; and labor disputes. We seek to maintain operating margins by attempting to increase the price of our products and services in response to increased costs, but may not be successful in passing these price increases through to our customers.Our volume of fixed-price contracts for our Energy Segment could adversely affect our business.We currently generate, and expect to continue to generate, a significant portion of our revenues under fixed price contracts. We must estimate the costs of completing a particular project to bid for fixed-price contracts. The actual cost of labor and materials, however, may vary from the costs we originally estimated. Depending on the size of a particular project, variations from estimated cost could have a significant impact on our operating results for any fiscal year.Our operations could be adversely impacted by the continuing effects from government regulations. Various regulations have been implemented related to new safety and certification requirements applicable to oil and gas drilling and production activities. While certain new drilling plans and drilling permits have been approved, we cannot predict whether operators will be able to satisfy these requirements. Further, we cannot predict what the continuing effects of government regulations on offshore deepwater drilling projects may have on offshore oil and gas exploration and development activity, or what actions may be taken by our customers or other industry participants in response to these regulations. Changes in laws or regulations regarding offshore oil and gas exploration and development activities and decisions by customers and other industry participants could reduce demand for our services, which would have a negative impact on our operations. Similarly, we cannot accurately predict future regulations by the government in any country in which we operate and how those regulations may affect our ability to perform projects in those regions. Federal, state and local governments have a major impact on the framework and economics of the US nuclear power industry.  Changes in laws or regulations regarding the operations of current nuclear facilities could have an impact on the demand for our products and services, which would have a negative impact on our operations. These same risks are also associated with foreign nuclear power industries.New regulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business.On August 22, 2012, the SEC adopted a rule pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act which established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for publicly-traded companies that use tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold (collectively, “conflict minerals”) mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in their products. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including costs for due diligence to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes, or sources of supply. Despite our due diligence efforts, we may be unable to verify the origin of all conflict minerals used in our component products. As a result, we may face reputational and other challenges with customers that require that all of the components incorporated in our products be certified as conflict-free.Our acquisition strategy involves a number of risks.We intend to pursue continued growth through opportunities to acquire companies or assets that will enable us to expand our product and service offerings and to increase our geographic footprint. We routinely review potential acquisitions. However, we may be unable to implement this growth strategy if we cannot reach agreement on potential strategic acquisitions on acceptable terms or for other reasons. Moreover, our acquisition strategy involves certain risks, including: •difficulties in the post acquisition integration of operations and systems;•the termination of relationships with key personnel and customers of the acquired company;•a failure to add additional employees to manage the increased volume of business;•additional post acquisition challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, financial reporting and legal compliance;8Table of Contents•risks and liabilities from our acquisitions, some of which may not be discovered during the preacquisition due diligence process;•a disruption of our ongoing business or an inability of our ongoing business to receive sufficient management attention; and•a failure to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated prior to acquisition.Future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on current attractive market terms.Our use of percentage-of-completion accounting in the Energy Segment could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits.As discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, a portion of our revenues is recognized on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. The percentage-of-completion accounting practice causes us to recognize contract revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs. The earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenues, costs and profitability. Contract losses are recognized in full when determined, and contract profit estimates are adjusted based on ongoing reviews of contract profitability. Actual collection of contract amounts or change orders could differ from original estimated amounts and could result in a reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings. In certain circumstances, it is possible that such adjustments could be significant.We may not be able to fully realize the revenue value reported in our backlog for our Energy Segment.We have a backlog of work in our Energy Segment. Orders included in our backlog are represented by customer purchase orders and contracts, which we believe to be firm. Backlog develops as a result of new business secured, which represents the revenue value of new project commitments received by us during a given period. Backlog consists of projects which have either (1) not been started or (2) are in progress and are not yet complete. In the latter case, the revenue value reported in backlog is the remaining value associated with work that has not yet been completed. From time to time, projects that were recorded as new business are cancelled. In the event of a project cancellation, we may be reimbursed for certain costs but typically have no contractual right to the total revenue reflected in our backlog. In addition to being unable to recover certain direct costs, we may also incur additional costs resulting from underutilized assets if projects are cancelled.Our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.Our quarterly results may be materially and adversely affected by: •the timing and volume of work under new agreements;•general economic conditions;•the budgetary spending patterns of customers;•variations in the margins of projects performed during any particular quarter;•losses experienced in our operations not otherwise covered by insurance;•a change in the demand or production of our products and our services caused by severe weather conditions;•a change in the mix of our customers, contracts and business;•a change in customer delivery schedule;•increases in design and manufacturing costs; and•abilities of customers to pay their invoices owed to us.Accordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results expected for any other quarter or for the entire year.We may be unsuccessful at generating internal growth.Our ability to generate internal growth will be affected by, among other factors, our ability to: •attract new customers, internationally and domestically;•integrate regulatory changes;•increase the number or size of projects performed for existing customers;•hire and retain employees; and•increase volume utilizing our existing facilities.9Table of ContentsMany of the factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth may be beyond our control, and we cannot be certain that our strategies will be successful or that we will be able to generate cash flow sufficient to fund our operations and to support internal growth. If we are unsuccessful, we may not be able to achieve internal growth, expand our operations or grow our business.The departure of key personnel could disrupt our business.We depend on the continued efforts of our executive officers and senior management. We cannot be certain that any individual will continue in such capacity for any particular period of time. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees, could negatively impact our ability to manage our business.Our business requires skilled labor, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees.Our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability could be limited by an inability to employ, train and retain skilled personnel necessary to meet our requirements. We may experience shortages of qualified personnel. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an adequately skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy or that our labor expense will not increase as a result of shortage in the supply of skilled personnel. Labor shortages or increased labor costs could impair our ability to maintain our business or grow our revenues.Actual and potential claims, lawsuits, and proceedings could ultimately reduce our profitability and liquidity and weaken our financial condition.In the future, the Company could be named as a defendant in legal proceedings claiming damages from us in connection with the operation of our business. Most of the actions against us arise out of the normal course of our performing services or with respect to the equipment we manufacture. We could potentially be a plaintiff in legal proceedings against customers, in which we seek to recover payments of contractual amounts due to us, and claims for increased costs incurred by us. When appropriate, we establish provisions against certain legal exposures, and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to ongoing developments related to each exposure. If in the future our assumptions and estimates related to such exposures prove to be inadequate or incorrect, our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, claims, lawsuits and proceedings may harm our reputation and possibly divert management resources away from operating our business.Technological innovations by competitors may make existing products and production methods obsolete.All of the products manufactured and sold by the Company depend upon the best available technology for success in the marketplace. The competitive environment is highly sensitive to technological innovation in both segments of our business. It is possible for our competitors, both foreign and domestic, to develop new products or production methods, which will make current products or methods obsolete or at least hasten their obsolescence.Catastrophic events could disrupt our business.The occurrence of catastrophic events ranging from natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis or hurricanes to epidemics such as health epidemics to acts of war and terrorism could disrupt or delay our ability to complete projects and could potentially expose the Company to third-party liability claims. Such events may or may not be fully covered by our various insurance policies or may be subject to deductibles. In addition, such events could impact our customers and suppliers, resulting in temporary or long-term delays and/or cancellations of orders or raw materials used in normal business operations. These situations are outside the Company’s control and could have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations.Adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations could make it easier for our employees to obtain union representation and our business could be adversely impacted.Other than a nominal number of employees at four of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, none of our employees are currently represented by unions. However, our U.S. based employees have the right at any time under the National Labor Relations Act to form or affiliate with a union. If some or our entire workforce were to become unionized and the terms of the collective bargaining agreement were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements, it could increase our costs and adversely impact our profitability. Any changes in regulations, the imposition of new regulations, or the enactment of new legislation could have an adverse impact on our business; to the extent it becomes easier for workers to obtain union representation.10Table of ContentsAZZ’s flexibility to operate its business could be impacted by provisions in its debt obligations.AZZ’s debt instruments contain covenants which restrict or prohibit certain actions (“negative covenants”), including, but not limited to, AZZ’s ability to incur debt, create or suffer to exist liens, capital spending limits, engage in certain merger, acquisition, or divestiture actions, or increase dividends beyond a specific level. AZZ’s debt instruments also contain covenants requiring AZZ to, among other things, maintain specified financial ratios (“affirmative covenants”). Failure to comply with these negative covenants and affirmative covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could restrict the Company’s access to liquidity and have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business or prospects. If the Company does not have  enough cash to service its debt or fund other liquidity needs, AZZ may be required to take actions such as requesting a waiver from lenders, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing all or part of the existing debt, or seeking additional equity capital. AZZ cannot assure that any of these remedies can be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all.A failure in our operational systems or cyber security attacks on any of our facilities, or those of third parties, mayaffect adversely our financial results. Our business is dependent upon our operational systems to process a large amount of data and complex transactions. If any of our financial, operational, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, our financial results could be adversely affected. Our financial results could also be adversely affected if an employee causes our operational systems to fail, either as a result of inadvertent error or by deliberately tampering with or manipulating our operational systems. Due to increased technology advances, we have become more reliant on technology to help increase efficiency in our business. We use computer programs to help run our financial and operations sectors, and this may subject our business to increased risks. Any future cyber security attacks that affect our facilities, our customers and any financial data could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, cyber attacks on our customer and employee data may result in a financial loss, including potential fines for failure to safeguard data, and may negatively impact our reputation. Third-party systems on which we rely could also suffer operational system failure. Any of these occurrences could disrupt our business, result in potential liability or reputational damage or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial results.Uncertainties in the interpretation and application of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate. We are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the U.S. and internationally. Many of these jurisdictions have made changes to their tax policies, including tax reform in the U.S. that was enacted in December 2017.  In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was signed into law revising the U.S. corporate income tax. Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the elimination of certain deductions and imposing a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Act also includes international provisions, which generally establish a territorial-style system for taxing foreign source income of domestic multinational corporations. The most significant change was for the provisional benefit related to the remeasurement of deferred taxes at the lower corporate rate.The overall impact of the new federal tax law is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. Financial results for fiscal 2018 reflect provisional estimates based on our initial analysis and current interpretation of the legislation. Given the complexity of the legislation, anticipated guidance from the Internal Revenue Service, and the potential for additional guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Financial Accounting Standards Board, these provisional estimates may be adjusted during fiscal year 2019, which could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the newly enacted federal tax law"

Our business is subject to a variety of risks, including but not limited to the risks described below, which we believe are the most significant risks and uncertainties facing our business.  Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or not described below may also impair our business operations in the future. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations and future growth could be negatively impacted.Our business segments operate in highly competitive markets.Many of our competitors, primarily in our Energy Segment, are significantly larger and have substantially more resources than AZZ. Competition is based on a number of factors, including price. Certain of our competitors may have lower cost structures and may, therefore, be able to provide their products and services at lower prices than we are able to provide. We cannot be certain that our competitors will not develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both price and quality in the future. Similarly, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position within our industries, maintain our customer base at current levels or increase our customer base.Climate change could impact our business.Climate changes could result in an adverse impact on AZZ's operations, particularly in hurricane prone or low lying areas near the ocean.  At this time, the Company is not able to speculate as to the potential timing or impact from potential global warming and other natural disasters, however the Company believes that it currently has adequate insurance coverage and disaster recovery plans related to any potential natural disasters that might occur at any of the Company’s sites.Changes in greenhouse gas regulations could impact our operating results.International agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are currently in various stages of discussion or implementation. These and other greenhouse gas emissions-related laws, policies and regulations may result in substantial capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs. The level of expenditure required to comply with these laws and regulations is uncertain and is expected to vary depending on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction, our activities in the particular jurisdiction, and market conditions.The effect of regulation on our financial performance will depend on a number of factors including, not limited to, the sectors covered, the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required by law, the extent to which we would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits and the impact of legislation or other regulation on our ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of our products and services.Our business segments are sensitive to economic downturns.If the general level of economic activity deteriorates from current levels, our customers may delay or cancel new projects. If there is a reduction in demand for our products or services, as a result of a downturn in the general economy, there could be a material adverse effect on price levels and the quantity of goods and services purchased, therefore adversely impacting revenues and results from operations. A number of factors, including financing conditions and potential bankruptcies in the industries we serve, could adversely affect our customers and their ability or willingness to fund capital expenditures in the future and pay for past services. Certain economic conditions may also impact the financial condition of one or more of our key suppliers, which could affect our ability to secure raw materials and components to meet our customers’ demand for our products in the future. Other various factors drive demand for our products and services, including the price of oil, economic forecasts and financial markets. Uncertainty in the global economy and financial markets could continue to impact our customers and could in turn severely impact the demand for spending projects that would result in a reduction in orders for our products and services. All of these factors combined together could materially impact our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and potentially impact the trading price of our common stock.International and political events may adversely affect our Energy and Galvanizing Segments.A portion of the revenues from our Energy and Galvanizing Segments are from international markets. The occurrence of any of the risks described below could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition: •political and economic instability, such as is occurring in Northern Africa, Europe and the Middle East;•social unrest, acts of terrorism, force majeure, war or other armed conflict;•inflation;•currency fluctuation, devaluations and conversion restrictions;•governmental activities that limit or disrupt markets, restrict payments or limit the movement of funds; and•trade restrictions and economic embargoes by the United States or other countries.Fluctuations in the price and supply of raw materials and natural gas for our business segments may adversely affect our operations.We purchase a wide variety of raw materials for our Energy Segment to manufacture our products, including copper, aluminum, steel and nickel. Unanticipated increases in raw material requirements or price increases could increase production costs and adversely affect profitability. In our Galvanizing Segment, zinc and natural gas represent a large portion of our cost of sales. The prices of zinc and natural gas are subject to volatility. The following factors, which are beyond our control, affect the price of raw materials and natural gas for our business segments: supply and demand; freight costs and transportation availability; trade duties and taxes; and labor disputes. We seek to maintain operating margins by attempting to increase the price of our products and services in response to increased costs, but may not be successful in passing these price increases through to our customers.Our volume of fixed-price contracts for our Energy Segment could adversely affect our business.We currently generate, and expect to continue to generate, a significant portion of our revenues under fixed price contracts. We must estimate the costs of completing a particular project to bid for fixed-price contracts. The actual cost of labor and materials, however, may vary from the costs we originally estimated. Depending on the size of a particular project, variations from estimated cost could have a significant impact on our operating results for any fiscal year.Our operations could be adversely impacted by the continuing effects from government regulations. Various regulations have been implemented related to new safety and certification requirements applicable to oil and gas drilling and production activities.  While certain new drilling plans and drilling permits have been approved, we cannot predict whether operators will be able to satisfy these requirements.  Further, we cannot predict what the continuing effects of government regulations on offshore deepwater drilling projects may have on offshore oil and gas exploration and development activity, or what actions may be taken by our customers or other industry participants in response to these regulations.  Changes in laws or regulations regarding offshore oil and gas exploration and development activities and decisions by customers and other industry participants could reduce demand for our services, which would have a negative impact on our operations.  Similarly, we cannot accurately predict future regulations by the government in any country in which we operate and how those regulations may affect our ability to perform projects in those regions. Federal, state and local governments have a major impact on the framework and economics of the US nuclear power industry.  Changes in laws or regulations regarding the operations of current nuclear facilities could have an impact on the demand for our products and services, which would have a negative impact on our operations.  These same risks are also associated with foreign nuclear power industries.New regulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business.On August 22, 2012, the SEC adopted a rule pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act which established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for publicly-traded companies that use tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold (collectively, “conflict minerals”) mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in their products. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including costs for due diligence to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes, or sources of supply.  Despite our due diligence efforts, we may be unable to verify the origin of all conflict minerals used in our component products.  As a result, we may face reputational and other challenges with customers that require that all of the components incorporated in our products be certified as conflict-free.Our acquisition strategy involves a number of risks.We intend to pursue continued growth through opportunities to acquire companies or assets that will enable us to expand our product and service offerings and to increase our geographic footprint.

These and other greenhouse gas emissions-related laws, policies and regulations may result in substantial capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs. The level of expenditure required to comply with these laws and regulations is uncertain and is expected to vary depending on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction, our activities in the particular jurisdiction, and market conditions.The effect of regulation on our financial performance will depend on a number of factors including, not limited to, the sectors covered, the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required by law, the extent to which we would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits and the impact of legislation or other regulation on our ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of our products and services.Our business segments are sensitive to economic downturns.If the general level of economic activity deteriorates from current levels, our customers may delay or cancel new projects. If there is a reduction in demand for our products or services, as a result of a downturn in the general economy, there could be a material adverse effect on price levels and the quantity of goods and services purchased, therefore adversely impacting revenues and results from operations. A number of factors, including financing conditions and potential bankruptcies in the industries we serve, could adversely affect our customers and their ability or willingness to fund capital expenditures in the future and pay for past services. Certain economic conditions may also impact the financial condition of one or more of our key suppliers, which could affect our ability to secure raw materials and components to meet our customers’ demand for our products in the future. Other various factors drive demand for our products and services, including the price of oil, economic forecasts and financial markets. Uncertainty in the global economy and financial markets could continue to impact our customers and could in turn severely impact the demand for spending projects that would result in a reduction in orders for our products and services. All of these factors combined together could materially impact our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and potentially impact the trading price of our common stock.International and political events may adversely affect our Energy and Galvanizing Segments.A portion of the revenues from our Energy and Galvanizing Segments are from international markets. The occurrence of any of the risks described below could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition: •political and economic instability, such as is occurring in Northern Africa, Europe and the Middle East;•social unrest, acts of terrorism, force majeure, war or other armed conflict;•inflation;•currency fluctuation, devaluations and conversion restrictions;•governmental activities that limit or disrupt markets, restrict payments or limit the movement of funds; and•trade restrictions and economic embargoes by the United States or other countries.Fluctuations in the price and supply of raw materials and natural gas for our business segments may adversely affect our operations.We purchase a wide variety of raw materials for our Energy Segment to manufacture our products, including copper, aluminum, steel and nickel. Unanticipated increases in raw material requirements or price increases could increase production costs and adversely affect profitability. In our Galvanizing Segment, zinc and natural gas represent a large portion of our cost of sales. The prices of zinc and natural gas are subject to volatility. The following factors, which are beyond our control, affect the price of raw materials and natural gas for our business segments: supply and demand; freight costs and transportation availability; trade duties and taxes; and labor disputes. We seek to maintain operating margins by attempting to increase the price of our products and services in response to increased costs, but may not be successful in passing these price increases through to our customers.Our volume of fixed-price contracts for our Energy Segment could adversely affect our business.We currently generate, and expect to continue to generate, a significant portion of our revenues under fixed price contracts. We must estimate the costs of completing a particular project to bid for fixed-price contracts. The actual cost of labor and materials, however, may vary from the costs we originally estimated. Depending on the size of a particular project, variations from estimated cost could have a significant impact on our operating results for any fiscal year.Our operations could be adversely impacted by the continuing effects from government regulations. Various regulations have been implemented related to new safety and certification requirements applicable to oil and gas drilling and production activities.  While certain new drilling plans and drilling permits have been approved, we cannot predict whether operators will be able to satisfy these requirements.  Further, we cannot predict what the continuing effects of government regulations on offshore deepwater drilling projects may have on offshore oil and gas exploration and development activity, or what actions may be taken by our customers or other industry participants in response to these regulations.  Changes in laws or regulations regarding offshore oil and gas exploration and development activities and decisions by customers and other industry participants could reduce demand for our services, which would have a negative impact on our operations.  Similarly, we cannot accurately predict future regulations by the government in any country in which we operate and how those regulations may affect our ability to perform projects in those regions. Federal, state and local governments have a major impact on the framework and economics of the US nuclear power industry.  Changes in laws or regulations regarding the operations of current nuclear facilities could have an impact on the demand for our products and services, which would have a negative impact on our operations.  These same risks are also associated with foreign nuclear power industries.New regulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business.On August 22, 2012, the SEC adopted a rule pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act which established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for publicly-traded companies that use tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold (collectively, “conflict minerals”) mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in their products. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including costs for due diligence to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes, or sources of supply.  Despite our due diligence efforts, we may be unable to verify the origin of all conflict minerals used in our component products.  As a result, we may face reputational and other challenges with customers that require that all of the components incorporated in our products be certified as conflict-free.Our acquisition strategy involves a number of risks.We intend to pursue continued growth through the pursuit of opportunities to acquire companies or assets that will enable us to expand our product and service offerings and to increase our geographic footprint. We routinely review potential acquisitions. However, we may be unable to implement this growth strategy if we cannot reach agreement on potential strategic acquisitions on acceptable terms or for other reasons. Moreover, our acquisition strategy involves certain risks, including: •difficulties in the post acquisition integration of operations and systems;•the termination of relationships with key personnel and customers of the acquired company;•a failure to add additional employees to manage the increased volume of business;•additional post acquisition challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, financial reporting and legal compliance;•risks and liabilities from our acquisitions, some of which may not be discovered during the preacquisition due diligence process;•a disruption of our ongoing business or an inability of our ongoing business to receive sufficient management attention; and•a failure to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated prior to acquisition.Future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on current attractive market terms.Our use of percentage-of-completion accounting in the Energy Segment could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits.As discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, a portion of our revenues is recognized on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. The percentage-of-completion accounting practice causes us to recognize contract revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs. The earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenues, costs and profitability. Contract losses are recognized in full when determined, and contract profit estimates are adjusted based on ongoing reviews of contract profitability. Actual collection of contract amounts or change orders could differ from original estimated amounts and could result in a reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings. In certain circumstances, it is possible that such adjustments could be significant.We may not be able to fully realize the revenue value reported in our backlog for our Energy Segment.We have a backlog of work in our Energy Segment. Orders included in our backlog are represented by customer purchase orders and contracts, which we believe to be firm. Backlog develops as a result of new business secured, which represents the revenue value of new project commitments received by us during a given period. Backlog consists of projects which have either (1) not been started or (2) are in progress and are not yet complete. In the latter case, the revenue value reported in backlog is the remaining value associated with work that has not yet been completed. From time to time, projects that were recorded as new business are cancelled. In the event of a project cancellation, we may be reimbursed for certain costs but typically have no contractual right to the total revenue reflected in our backlog. In addition to being unable to recover certain direct costs, we may also incur additional costs resulting from underutilized assets if projects are cancelled.Our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.Our quarterly results may be materially and adversely affected by: •the timing and volume of work under new agreements;•general economic conditions;•the budgetary spending patterns of customers;•variations in the margins of projects performed during any particular quarter;•losses experienced in our operations not otherwise covered by insurance;•a change in the demand or production of our products and our services caused by severe weather conditions;•a change in the mix of our customers, contracts and business;•a change in customer delivery schedule;•increases in design and manufacturing costs; and•abilities of customers to pay their invoices owed to us.Accordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results expected for any other quarter or for the entire year.We may be unsuccessful at generating internal growth.Our ability to generate internal growth will be affected by, among other factors, our ability to: •attract new customers, internationally and domestically;•potential regulatory changes;•increase the number or size of projects performed for existing customers;•hire and retain employees; and•increase volume utilizing our existing facilities.Many of the factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth may be beyond our control, and we cannot be certain that our strategies will be successful or that we will be able to generate cash flow sufficient to fund our operations and to support internal growth. If we are unsuccessful, we may not be able to achieve internal growth, expand our operations or grow our business.The departure of key personnel could disrupt our business.We depend on the continued efforts of our executive officers and senior management. We cannot be certain that any individual will continue in such capacity for any particular period of time. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees, could negatively impact our ability to manage our business.Our business requires skilled labor, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees.Our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability could be limited by an inability to employ, train and retain skilled personnel necessary to meet our requirements. We may experience shortages of qualified personnel. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an adequately skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy or that our labor expense will not increase as a result of shortage in the supply of skilled personnel. Labor shortages or increased labor costs could impair our ability to maintain our business or grow our revenues.Actual and potential claims, lawsuits, and proceedings could ultimately reduce our profitability and liquidity and weaken our financial condition.In the future, the Company could be named as a defendant in legal proceedings claiming damages from us in connection with the operation of our business. Most of the actions against us arise out of the normal course of our performing services or with respect to the equipment we manufacture. We could potentially be a plaintiff in legal proceedings against customers, in which we seek to recover payments of contractual amounts due to us, and claims for increased costs incurred by us. When appropriate, we establish provisions against certain legal exposures, and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to ongoing developments related to each exposure. If in the future our assumptions and estimates related to such exposures prove to be inadequate or incorrect, our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, claims, lawsuits and proceedings may harm our reputation and possibly divert management resources away from operating our business.Technological innovations by competitors may make existing products and production methods obsolete.All of the products manufactured and sold by the Company depend upon the best available technology for success in the marketplace. The competitive environment is highly sensitive to technological innovation in both segments of our business. It is possible for our competitors, both foreign and domestic, to develop new products or production methods, which will make current products or methods obsolete or at least hasten their obsolescence.Catastrophic events could disrupt our business.The occurrence of catastrophic events ranging from natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis or hurricanes to epidemics such as health epidemics to acts of war and terrorism could disrupt or delay our ability to complete projects and could potentially expose the Company to third-party liability claims. Such events may or may not be fully covered by our various insurance policies or may be subject to deductibles. In addition, such events could impact our customers and suppliers, resulting in temporary or long-term delays and/or cancellations of orders or raw materials used in normal business operations. These situations are outside the Company’s control and could have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations.Adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations could make it easier for our employees to obtain union representation and our business could be adversely impacted.Other than an immaterial number of employees at four of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, none of our employees are currently represented by unions. However, our U.S. based employees have the right at any time under the National Labor Relations Act to form or affiliate with a union. If some or our entire workforce were to become unionized and the terms of the collective bargaining agreement were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements, it could increase our costs and adversely impact our profitability. Any changes in regulations, the imposition of new regulations, or the enactment of new legislation could have an adverse impact on our business; to the extent it becomes easier for workers to obtain union representation.AZZ’s flexibility to operate its business could be impacted by provisions in its debt obligations.AZZ’s debt instruments contain covenants which restrict or prohibit certain actions (“negative covenants”), including, but not limited to, AZZ’s ability to incur debt, create or suffer to exist liens, capital spending limits, engage in certain merger, acquisition, or divestiture actions, or increase dividends beyond a specific level.  AZZ’s debt instruments also contain covenants requiring AZZ to, among other things, maintain specified financial ratios (“affirmative covenants”). Failure to comply with these negative covenants and affirmative covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could restrict the Company’s access to liquidity and have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business or prospects.  If the Company does not have  enough cash to service its debt or fund other liquidity needs, AZZ may be required to take actions such as requesting a waiver from lenders, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing all or part of the existing debt, or seeking additional equity capital.  AZZ cannot assure that any of these remedies can be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all.A failure in our operational systems or cyber security attacks on any of our facilities, or those of third parties, mayaffect adversely our financial results. Our business is dependent upon our operational systems to process a large amount of data and complex transactions. If any of our financial, operational, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, our financial results could be adversely affected. Our financial results could also be adversely affected if an employee causes our operational systems to fail, either as a result of inadvertent error or by deliberately tampering with or manipulating our operational systems. Due to increased technology advances, we have become more reliant on technology to help increase efficiency in our business. We use computer programs to help run our financial and operations sectors, and this may subject our business to increased risks. Any future cyber security attacks that affect our facilities, our customers and any financial data could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, cyber attacks on our customer and employee data may result in a financial loss, including potential fines for failure to safeguard data, and may negatively impact our reputation. Third-party systems on which we rely could also suffer operational system failure. Any of these occurrences could disrupt our business, result in potential liability or reputational damage or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial results"

Our business is subject to a variety of risks, including the risks described below, which we believe are the most significant risks and uncertainties facing our business. However, they are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or not described below may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted and our future growth could be impacted as well.Our business segments operate in highly competitive markets.Many of our competitors, primarily in our Energy Segment, are significantly larger and have substantially more resources. Competition is based on a number of factors, including price. Certain of our competitors may have lower cost structures and may, therefore, be able to provide their products and services at lower prices than we are able to provide. We cannot be certain that our competitors will not develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both price and quality. Similarly, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position within our industries, maintain our customer base at current levels or increase our customer base.Climate change could impact our business.Climate changes could have an adverse impact on the Company, particularly in hurricane prone or low lying areas near the ocean.

At this time, the Company is not able to speculate as to the potential timing or impact from potential global warming and other natural disasters, however the Company believes that it currently has adequate insurance coverage related to natural disasters at the Company’s sites.International agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are currently in various stages of discussion or implementation. These and other greenhouse gas emissions-related laws, policies and regulations may result in substantial capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs. The level of expenditure required to comply with these laws and regulations is uncertain and is expected to vary depending on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction, our activities in the particular jurisdiction and market conditions.The effect of regulation on our financial performance will depend on a number of factors including, among others, the sectors covered, the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required by law, the extent to which we would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits and the impact of legislation or other regulation on our ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of our products and services.Our business segments are sensitive to economic downturns.If the general level of economic activity deteriorates from current levels, our customers may delay or cancel new projects. If there is a reduction in demand for our products or services, as a result of a downturn in the general economy, there could be a material adverse effect on price levels and the quantity of goods and services purchased, therefore adversely impacting revenues and results from operations. A number of factors, including financing conditions and potential bankruptcies in the industries we serve, could adversely affect our customers and their ability or willingness to fund capital expenditures in the future and pay for past services. Certain economic conditions may also impact the financial condition of one or more of our key suppliers, which could affect our ability to secure raw materials and components to meet our customers’ demand for our products. Other various factors drive demand for our products and services, including the price of oil, economic forecasts and financial markets. Uncertainty in the global economy and financial markets could continue to impact our customers and could in turn severely impact the demand for spending projects that would result in a reduction in orders for our products and services. All of these factors together could materially impact our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and potentially impact the trading price of our common stock.International and political events may adversely affect our Electrical and Industrial Products and Galvanizing Services Segments.A portion of the revenues from our Electrical and Industrial Products and Services and Galvanizing Services Segments are from international markets. The occurrence of any of the risks described below could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition: •political and economic instability, such as is occurring in Northern Africa, Europe and the Middle East;•social unrest, acts of terrorism, force majeure, war or other armed conflict;•inflation;•currency fluctuation, devaluations and conversion restrictions;•governmental activities that limit or disrupt markets, restrict payments or limit the movement of funds; and•trade restrictions and economic embargoes by the United States or other countries.Fluctuations in the price and supply of raw materials and natural gas for our business segments may adversely affect our operations.We purchase a wide variety of raw materials for our Electrical and Industrial Products and Services Segment to manufacture our products, including steel, aluminum and copper. Unanticipated increases in raw material requirements or price increases could increase production costs and adversely affect profitability. In our Galvanizing Services Segment, zinc and natural gas represent a large portion of our cost of sales. The prices of zinc and natural gas are subject to volatility. The following factors, which are beyond our control, affect the price of raw materials and natural gas for our business segments: supply and demand; freight costs and transportation availability; trade duties and taxes; and labor disputes. We seek to maintain operating margins by attempting to increase the price of our products and services in response to increased costs, but may not be successful in passing these price increases through to our customers.Our volume of fixed-price contracts for our Electrical and Industrial Products and Services Segment could adversely affect our business.We currently generate, and expect to continue to generate, a significant portion of our revenues under fixed price contracts. We must estimate the costs of completing a particular project to bid for fixed-price contracts. The actual cost of labor and materials, however, may vary from the costs we originally estimated. Depending on the size of a particular project, variations from estimated cost could have a significant impact on our operating results for any fiscal year.Our operations could be adversely impacted by the continuing effects from government regulations. Various regulations have been implemented related to new safety and certification requirements applicable to oil and gas drilling and production activities.  While certain new drilling plans and drilling permits have been approved, we cannot predict whether operators will be able to satisfy these requirements.  Further, we cannot predict what the continuing effects of government regulations on offshore deepwater drilling projects may have on offshore oil and gas exploration and development activity, or what actions may be taken by our customers or other industry participants in response to these regulations.  Changes in laws or regulations regarding offshore oil and gas exploration and development activities and decisions by customers and other industry participants could reduce demand for our services, which would have a negative impact on our operations.  Similarly, we cannot accurately predict future regulations by the government in any country in which we operate and how those regulations may affect our ability to perform projects in those regions. Our acquisition strategy involves a number of risks.We intend to pursue growth through the pursuit of opportunities to acquire companies or assets that will enable us to expand our product and service offerings and to increase our geographic footprint. We routinely review potential acquisitions. However, we may be unable to implement this growth strategy if we cannot reach agreement on potential strategic acquisitions on acceptable terms or for other reasons. Moreover, our acquisition strategy involves certain risks, including: •difficulties in the integration of operations and systems;•the termination of relationships by key personnel and customers of the acquired company;•a failure to add additional employees to handle the increased volume of business;•additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management and financial reporting;•risks and liabilities from our acquisitions, some of which may not be discovered during our due diligence;•a disruption of our ongoing business or an inability of our ongoing business to receive sufficient management attention; and•a failure to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated.Future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on attractive terms.Our use of percentage-of-completion accounting in the Electrical and Industrial Products and Services Segment could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits.As discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, a portion of our revenues is recognized on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. The percentage-of-completion accounting practice causes us to recognize contract revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs. The earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenues, costs and profitability. Contract losses are recognized in full when determined, and contract profit estimates are adjusted based on ongoing reviews of contract profitability. Actual collection of contract amounts or change orders could differ from estimated amounts and could result in a reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings. In certain circumstances, it is possible that such adjustments could be significant.We may not be able to fully realize the revenue value reported in our backlog for our Electrical and Industrial Products and Services Segment.We have a backlog of work in our Electrical and Industrial Products and Services Segment. Orders included in our backlog are represented by customer purchase orders and contracts, which we believe to be firm. Backlog develops as a result of new business secured, which represents the revenue value of new project commitments received by us during a given period. Backlog consists of projects which have either (1) not yet been started or (2) are in progress and are not yet complete. In the latter case, the revenue value reported in backlog is the remaining value associated with work that has not yet been completed. From time to time, projects that were recorded as new business are cancelled. In the event of a project cancellation, we may be reimbursed for certain costs but typically have no contractual right to the total revenue reflected in our backlog. In addition to being unable to recover certain direct costs, we may also incur additional costs resulting from underutilized assets if projects are cancelled.Our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.Our quarterly results may be materially and adversely affected by: •the timing and volume of work under new agreements;•general economic conditions;•inclement weather;•the budgetary spending patterns of customers;•variations in the margins of projects performed during any particular quarter;•losses experienced in our operations not otherwise covered by insurance;•a change in the demand or production of our products and our services caused by severe weather conditions;•a change in the mix of our customers, contracts and business;•a change in customer delivery schedule;•increases in design and manufacturing costs; and•abilities of customers to pay their invoices owed to us.Accordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results expected for any other quarter or for the entire year.We may be unsuccessful at generating internal growth.Our ability to generate internal growth will be affected by, among other factors, our ability to: •attract new customers, internationally and domestically;•potential regulatory changes;•increase the number or size of projects performed for existing customers;•hire and retain employees; and•increase volume utilizing our existing facilities.Many of the factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth may be beyond our control, and we cannot be certain that our strategies will be successful or that we will be able to generate cash flow sufficient to fund our operations and to support internal growth. If we are unsuccessful, we may not be able to achieve internal growth, expand our operations or grow our business.The departure of key personnel could disrupt our business.We depend on the continued efforts of our executive officers and senior management. We cannot be certain that any individual will continue in such capacity for any particular period of time. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees, could negatively impact our ability to manage our business.Our business requires skilled labor, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees.Our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability could be limited by an inability to employ, train and retain skilled personnel necessary to meet our requirements. We may experience shortages of qualified personnel. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an adequately skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy or that our labor expense will not increase as a result of shortage in the supply of skilled personnel. Labor shortages or increased labor costs could impair our ability to maintain our business or grow our revenues.Actual and potential claims, lawsuits, and proceedings could ultimately reduce our profitability and liquidity and weaken our financial condition.In the future, the Company could be named as a defendant in legal proceedings claiming damages from us in connection with the operation of our business. Most of the actions against us arise out of the normal course of our performing services or with respect to the equipment we manufacture. We could potentially be a plaintiff in legal proceedings against customers, in which we seek to recover payments of contractual amounts due to us, and claims for increased costs incurred by us. When appropriate, we establish provisions against certain legal exposures, and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to ongoing developments related to each exposure. If in the future our assumptions and estimates related to such exposures prove to be inadequate or incorrect, our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, claims, lawsuits and proceedings may harm our reputation and possibly divert management resources away from operating our business.Technological innovations by competitors may make existing products and production methods obsolete.All of the products manufactured and sold by the Company depend upon the best available technology for success in the marketplace. The competitive environment is highly sensitive to technological innovation in both segments of our business. It is possible for our competitors, both foreign and domestic, to develop new products or production methods, which will make current products or methods obsolete or at least hasten their obsolescence.Catastrophic events could disrupt our business.The occurrence of catastrophic events ranging from natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis or hurricanes to epidemics such as health epidemics to acts of war and terrorism could disrupt or delay our ability to complete projects and could potentially expose the Company to third-party liability claims. Such events may or may not be fully covered by our various insurance policies or may be subject to deductibles. In addition, such events could impact our customers and suppliers, resulting in temporary or long-term delays and/or cancellations of orders or raw materials used in normal business operations. These situations are outside the Company’s control and could have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations.We may incur additional healthcare costs arising from federal healthcare reform legislation.In March 2010, Congress passed, and the President signed, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. This legislation expands health care coverage to many uninsured individuals and expands coverage to those already insured, and this legislation is having a significant impact on health care providers, insurers and others associated with the health care industry. Federal and state governments may propose other health care initiatives and revisions to the health care and health insurance systems. We are currently evaluating the impact of this legislation on our business.  The changes required by this legislation could cause us to incur additional healthcare and other costs, but we do not expect any material short-term impact on our financial results as a result of the legislation and are currently assessing the extent of any long-term impact.Adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations could make it easier for our employees to obtain union representation and our business could be adversely impacted.Other than an immaterial number of employees at four of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, none of our employees are currently represented by unions. However, our employees have the right at any time under the National Labor Relations Act to form or affiliate with a union. If some or our entire workforce were to become unionized and the terms of the collective bargaining agreement were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements, it could increase our costs and adversely impact our profitability. Any changes in regulations, the imposition of new regulations, or the enactment of new legislation could have an adverse impact on our business; to the extent it becomes easier for workers to obtain union representation.AZZ’s flexibility to operate its business could be impacted by provisions in its debt obligations.AZZ’s debt instruments contain covenants which restrict or prohibit certain actions (“negative covenants”), including, but not limited to, AZZ’s ability to incur debt, create or suffer to exist liens, engage in certain merger, acquisition, or divestiture actions, or increase dividends beyond a specific level.  AZZ’s debt instruments also contain covenants requiring AZZ to, among other things, maintain specified financial ratios (“affirmative covenants”). Failure to comply with these negative covenants and affirmative covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could restrict the Company’s access to liquidity and have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business or prospects.  If the Company does not have  enough cash  to service its debt or fund other liquidity needs, AZZ may be required to take actions such as requesting a waiver from lenders, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing all or part of the existing debt, or seeking additional equity capital.  AZZ cannot assure that any of these remedies can be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all.A failure in our operational systems or cyber security attacks on any of our facilities, or those of third parties, mayaffect adversely our financial results. Our business is dependent upon our operational systems to process a large amount of data and complex transactions. If any of our financial, operational, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, our financial results could be adversely affected. Our financial results could also be adversely affected if an employee causes our operational systems to fail, either as a result of inadvertent error or by deliberately tampering with or manipulating our operational systems. Due to increased technology advances, we have become more reliant on technology to help increase efficiency in our business. We use computer programs to help run our financial and operations sectors, and this may subject our business to increased risks. Any future cyber security attacks that affect our facilities, our customers and any financial data could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, cyber attacks on our customer and employee data may result in a financial loss, including potential fines for failure to safeguard data, and may negatively impact our reputation. Third-party systems on which we rely could also suffer operational system failure. Any of these occurrences could disrupt our business, result in potential liability or reputational damage or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial results"

Our business is subject to a variety of risks, including the risks described below, which we believe are the most significant risks and uncertainties facing our business. However, they are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or not described below may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted and our future growth could be impacted as well.Our business segments operate in highly competitive markets.Many of our competitors, primarily in our Electrical and Industrial Products and Services Segment, are significantly larger and have substantially more resources. Competition is based on a number of factors, including price. Certain of our competitors may have lower cost structures and may, therefore, be able to provide their products and services at lower pricing than we are able to provide. We cannot be certain that our competitors will not develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both price and quality. Similarly, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position within our industries, maintain our customer base at current levels or increase our customer base.Climate change could impact our business.Climate changes could have an adverse impact on the Company, particularly in hurricane prone or low lying areas near the ocean.

Other various factors drive demand for our products and services, including the price of oil, economic forecasts and financial markets, including uncertainty regarding the ""sequester"" and related governmental spending and budget matters. Uncertainty in the global economy and financial markets could continue to impact our customers and could in turn severely impact the demand for spending projects that would result in a reduction in orders for our products and services. All of these factors together could materially impact our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and potentially impact the trading price of our common stock.International and political events may adversely affect our Electrical and Industrial Products and Galvanizing Services Segments.A portion of the revenues from our Electrical and Industrial Products and Galvanizing Services Segments are from international markets.

 Our business is subject to a variety of risks, including the risks described below, which we believe are the most significant risks anduncertainties facing our business. However, they are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or not described below may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted and our future growth could be impacted as well. Our business segments operate in highly competitive markets.  Many of our competitors, primarily in our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment, are significantly larger and have substantially more resources. Competition is based on a number of factors, includingprice. Certain of our competitors may have lower cost structures and may, therefore, be able to provide their products and services at lower pricing than we are able to provide. We cannot be certain that our competitors will not develop theexpertise, experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both price and quality. Similarly, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position within our industries, maintain our customerbase at current levels or increase our customer base.  Global warming could impact our business. Global warming could have an adverse impact on the Company, particularly in hurricane prone or low lying areas near the ocean. At thistime, the Company is not able to speculate as to the potential timing or impact from potential global warming, however the Company believes that it currently has adequate insurance coverage related to natural disasters at the Companys sites. International agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions arecurrently in various stages of discussion or implementation. These and other greenhouse gas emissions-related laws, policies and regulations may result in substantial capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs. The level of expenditurerequired to comply with these laws and regulations is uncertain and is expected to vary depending on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction, our activities in the particular jurisdiction and market conditions. The effect of regulation on our financial performance will depend on a number of factors including, among others, the sectors covered,the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required by law, the extent to which we would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price andavailability of emission allowances and credits and the impact of legislation or other regulation on our ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of our products and services.   6 Table of ContentsOur business segments are sensitive to economic downturns. If the general level of economic activity deteriorates from current levels, our customers may delay or cancel new projects. If there is areduction in demand for our products or services, as a result of a downturn in the general economy, there could be a material adverse effect on price levels and the quantity of goods and services purchased, therefore adversely impacting revenues andresults from operations. A number of factors, including financing conditions and potential bankruptcies in the industries we serve, could adversely affect our customers and their ability or willingness to fund capital expenditures in the future andpay for past services. Certain economic conditions may also impact the financial condition of one or more of our key suppliers, which could affect our ability to secure raw materials and components to meet our customers demand for ourproducts. Other various factors drive demand for our products and services, including the price of oil, economic forecasts and financial markets. Uncertainty in the global economy and financial markets could continue to impact our customers andcould in turn severely impact the demand for spending projects that would result in a reduction in orders for our products and services. All of these factors together could materially impact our business, financial condition, cash flows and resultsof operations and potentially impact the trading price of our common stock.  International and political events mayadversely affect our Electrical and Industrial Products and Galvanizing Services Segments.  A portion of the revenuesfrom our Electrical and Industrial Products and Galvanizing Services Segments are from international markets. The occurrence of any of the risks described below could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows andfinancial condition:      political and economic instability, such as is occurring in Northern Africa, Europe and the Middle East;    social unrest, acts of terrorism, force majeure, war or other armed conflict;    inflation;    currency fluctuation, devaluations and conversion restrictions;    governmental activities that limit or disrupt markets, restrict payments or limit the movement of funds; and    trade restrictions and economic embargoes by the United States or other countries. Fluctuations in the price and supply of raw materials and natural gas for our business segments may adversely affect ouroperations.  We purchase a wide variety of raw materials for our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment tomanufacture our products, including steel, aluminum and copper. Unanticipated increases in raw material requirements or price increases could increase production costs and adversely affect profitability. In our Galvanizing Services Segment, zinc andnatural gas represent a large portion of our cost of sales. The prices of zinc and natural gas are highly volatile. The following factors, which are beyond our control, affect the price of raw materials and natural gas for our business segments:supply and demand; freight costs and transportation availability; trade duties and taxes; and labor disputes. We seek to maintain operating margins by attempting to increase the price of our products and services in response to increased costs, butmay not be successful in passing these price increases through to our customers.  Our volume of fixed-price contractsfor our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment could adversely affect our business.  We currently generate, andexpect to continue to generate, a significant portion of our revenues under fixed price contracts. We must estimate the costs of completing a particular project to bid for fixed-price contracts. The actual cost of labor and materials, however, mayvary from the costs we originally estimated. Depending on the size of a particular project, variations from estimated cost could have a significant impact on our operating results for any fiscal year.   7 Table of ContentsOur compliance with various governmental regulations and environmental risks mayincrease our costs and potentially lower demand for our products.  In response to the Deepwater Horizon incident inthe U.S. Gulf of Mexico in April 2010, the U.S. government has implemented new safety and certification requirements applicable to drilling activities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, has imposed additional requirements with respect to development andproduction activities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and has delayed the approval of applications to drill in both deepwater and shallow-water areas. In addition, the U.S. government has announced that it intends to require that operators demonstratetheir compliance with new regulations before they resume deepwater drilling. While certain new drilling plans and drilling permits have been approved during 2011, we cannot predict when the pace at which operators in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico will beable to satisfy these requirements and return to previous levels of active drilling. Further, we cannot predict what the continuing effects from the U.S. government regulations on offshore deepwater drilling projects may have on offshore oil and gasexploration and development activity, or what actions may be taken by our customers or other industry participants in response to these regulations. Changes in laws or regulations regarding offshore oil and gas exploration and development activitiesand decisions by customers and other industry participants could reduce demand for our services, which would have a negative impact on our operations.  In addition, our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws andregulations may:      require the acquisition of a permit before operations can be commenced;     restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment;     require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former operations; and     impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. The recent trend toward stricter standards in environmental legislation and regulation is likely to continue. The enactment of stricterlegislation or the adoption of stricter regulations could have a significant impact on our operating costs.  Our acquisition strategyinvolves a number of risks.  We intend to pursue growth through the pursuit of opportunities to acquire companies orassets that will enable us to expand our product and service offerings and to increase our geographic footprint. We routinely review potential acquisitions. However, we may be unable to implement this growth strategy if we cannot reach agreement onpotential strategic acquisitions on acceptable terms or for other reasons. Moreover, our acquisition strategy involves certain risks, including:      difficulties in the integration of operations and systems;    the termination of relationships by key personnel and customers of the acquired company;    a failure to add additional employees to handle the increased volume of business;    additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management and financial reporting;   risks and liabilities from our acquisitions, some of which may not be discovered during our due diligence;    a disruption of our ongoing business or an inability of our ongoing business to receive sufficient management attention; and   a failure to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated.   8 Table of ContentsFuture acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which maynot be available on attractive terms.  Our use of percentage-of-completion accounting in the Electrical and IndustrialProducts Segment could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits.  As discussed inManagements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, a portion of our revenues is recognized onthe percentage-of-completion method of accounting. The percentage-of-completion accounting practice causes us to recognize contract revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs. The earningsor losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenues, costs and profitability. Contract losses are recognized in full when determined, and contract profit estimates are adjusted based on ongoing reviews ofcontract profitability. Actual collection of contract amounts or change orders could differ from estimated amounts and could result in a reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings. In certain circumstances, it is possible that suchadjustments could be significant.  We may not be able to fully realize the revenue value reported in our backlog for ourElectrical and Industrial Products Segment.  We have a backlog of work in our Electrical and Industrial ProductsSegment. Orders included in our backlog are represented by customer purchase orders and contracts, which we believe to be firm. Backlog develops as a result of new business secured, which represents the revenue value of new project commitmentsreceived by us during a given period. Backlog consists of projects which have either (1) not yet been started or (2) are in progress and are not yet complete. In the latter case, the revenue value reported in backlog is the remaining valueassociated with work that has not yet been completed. From time to time, projects that were recorded as new business are cancelled. In the event of a project cancellation, we may be reimbursed for certain costs but typically have no contractualright to the total revenue reflected in our backlog. In addition to being unable to recover certain direct costs, we may also incur additional costs resulting from underutilized assets if projects are cancelled. Our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Our quarterly results may be materially and adversely affected by:     the timing and volume of work under new agreements;    general economic conditions;    inclement weather, such as that which affected much of the continental United States during the fourth quarter of our fiscal 2011;   the budgetary spending patterns of customers;    variations in the margins of projects performed during any particular quarter;    losses experienced in our operations not otherwise covered by insurance;    a change in the demand or production of our products and our services caused by severe weather conditions;    a change in the mix of our customers, contracts and business;    a change in customer delivery schedule;    increases in design and manufacturing costs; and    abilities of customers to pay their invoices owed to us.  Accordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results expected for any other quarter or for the entire year.   9 Table of ContentsWe may be unsuccessful at generating internal growth. Our ability to generate internal growth will be affected by, among other factors, our ability to:     attract new customers, internationally and domestically;    potential regulatory changes;    increase the number or size of projects performed for existing customers;    hire and retain employees; and    increase volume utilizing our existing facilities.  Many of the factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth may be beyond our control, and we cannot be certain that our strategies will be successful or that we will be able to generate cashflow sufficient to fund our operations and to support internal growth. If we are unsuccessful, we may not be able to achieve internal growth, expand our operations or grow our business.  The departure of key personnel could disrupt our business.  Wedepend on the continued efforts of our executive officers and senior management. We cannot be certain that any individual will continue in such capacity for any particular period of time. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to hire andretain qualified employees, could negatively impact our ability to manage our business.  Our business requires skilled labor, and we maybe unable to attract and retain qualified employees.  Our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability willbe limited by our ability to employ, train and retain skilled personnel necessary to meet our requirements. We may experience shortages of qualified personnel. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an adequately skilled labor forcenecessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy or that our labor expense will not increase as a result of shortage in the supply of skilled personnel. Labor shortages or increased labor costs could impair our ability to maintainour business or grow our revenues.  Actual and potential claims, lawsuits, and proceedings could ultimately reduce ourprofitability and liquidity and weaken our financial condition.  In the future, the Company could be named as adefendant in legal proceedings claiming damages from us in connection with the operation of our business. Most of the actions against us arise out of the normal course of our performing services or with respect to the equipment we manufacture. Wecould potentially be a plaintiff in legal proceedings against customers, in which we seek to recover payments of contractual amounts due to us, as well as claims for increased costs incurred by us. When appropriate, we establish provisions againstcertain legal exposures, and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to ongoing developments related to each exposure. If in the future our assumptions and estimates related to such exposures prove to be inadequate or incorrect, ourconsolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, claims, lawsuits and proceedings may harm our reputation and possibly divert management resources away from operating our business. Technological innovations by competitors may make existing products and production methods obsolete. All of the products manufactured and sold by the Company depend upon the best available technology for success in the marketplace. Thecompetitive environment is highly sensitive to technological innovation in both segments of our business. It is possible for our competitors, both foreign and domestic, to develop new products or production methods, which will make current productsor methods obsolete or at least hasten their obsolescence.   10 Table of ContentsCatastrophic events could disrupt our business. The occurrence of catastrophic events ranging from natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis or hurricanes to epidemics such ashealth epidemics to acts of war and terrorism could disrupt or delay our ability to complete projects and could potentially expose the Company to third-party liability claims. Such events may or may not be fully covered by our various insurancepolicies or may be subject to deductibles. In addition, such events could impact our customers and suppliers, resulting in temporary or long-term delays and/or cancellations of orders or raw materials used in normal business operations. Thesesituations are outside the Companys control and could have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations.  We mayincur additional healthcare costs arising from federal healthcare reform legislation.  In March 2010, Congress passed,and the President signed, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. This legislation expands health care coverage to many uninsured individuals and expands coverage to those already insured. The changes required by this legislation could causeus to incur additional healthcare and other costs, but we do not expect any material short-term impact on our financial results as a result of the legislation and are currently assessing the extent of any long-term impact. Adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations could make it easier for our employees to obtain unionrepresentation and our business could be adversely impacted.  Other than an immaterial number of employees at three ofour wholly-owned subsidiaries, none of our employees are currently represented by unions. However, our employees have the right at any time under the National Labor Relations Act to form or affiliate with a union. If some or our entire workforcewere to become unionized and the terms of the collective bargaining agreement were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements, it could increase our costs and adversely impact our profitability. Any changes in regulations,the imposition of new regulations, or the enactment of new legislation could have an adverse impact on our business; to the extent it becomes easier for workers to obtain union representation"
5,AZZ,AZZ INC,2011-05-12,"                        Risk Factors
Our business is subject to a variety of risks, including the risks described below, which we believe are the most significant risks and uncertainties facing our business. However, they are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or not described below may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted and our future growth could be impacted as well.Our operations could be adversely impacted by the Macondo well incident, the continuing effects from the U.S. government moratorium on offshore deepwater drilling projects and related new regulations. On April 22, 2010, the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon, which was engaged in deepwater drilling operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, sank after an explosion and fire. The incident resulted in a significant and uncontrolled oil spill off the coast of Louisiana. On May 28, 2010, the U.S. government imposed a six-month moratorium on all offshore deepwater drilling projects. A preliminary injunction was issued blocking enforcement of the moratorium on June 22, 2010, and the U.S. government issued a new moratorium on deepwater drilling on July 12, 2010. On October 12, 2010, the U.S. government lifted the moratorium. The U.S. government has also implemented additional safety and certification requirements applicable to drilling activities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, has imposed additional requirements with respect to development and production activities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and has delayed the approval of applications to drill in both deepwater and shallow-water areas. In addition, the U.S. government has announced that it intends to require that operators demonstrate their compliance with new regulations before resuming deepwater drilling. We cannot predict when, if at all, operators in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico will be able to satisfy these requirements. At this time, we cannot predict what, if any, impact the Macondo well incident, the continuing effects from the U.S. government moratorium on offshore deepwater drilling projects and related new regulations may have on the regulation of offshore oil and gas exploration and development activity, or what actions may be taken by our customers or other industry participants in response to the incident. Changes in laws or regulations regarding offshore oil and gas exploration and development activities and decisions by customers and other industry participants could reduce demand for our services, which would have a negative impact on our operations.Our business segments operate in highly competitive markets.Many of our competitors, primarily in our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment, are significantly larger and have substantially more resources than we do. Competition is based on a number of factors, including price. Certain of our competitors may have lower cost structures and may, therefore, be able to provide their products and services at lower pricing than we are able to provide. We cannot be certain that our competitors will not develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both price and quality. Similarly, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position within our industries, maintain our customer base at current levels or increase our customer base.  Global warming could impact our business.In regard to concerns about global warming, global warming could have an adverse impact on the Company, particularly in hurricane prone or low lying areas near the ocean. At this time, the Company is not able to speculate as to the potential timing or impact from potential global warming, however the Company believes that it currently has adequate insurance coverage related to natural disasters at the Company’s sites.  5  Our business segments are sensitive to economic downturns. If the general level of economic activity deteriorates from current levels, our customers may delay or cancel new projects. If there is a reduction in demand for our products or services, as a result of a downturn in the general economy, there could be a material adverse effect on price levels and the quantity of goods and services purchased, therefore adversely impacting revenues and results from operations. A number of factors, including financing conditions and potential bankruptcies in the industries we serve, could adversely affect our customers and their ability or willingness to fund capital expenditures in the future and pay for past services.International and political events may adversely affect our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment.A portion of the revenues from our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment are from international markets. The occurrence of any of the risks described below could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition:  ·political and economic instability, such as currently is occurring in Northern Africa and the Middle East;  ·social unrest, acts of terrorism, force majeure, war or other armed conflict;  ·inflation;  ·currency fluctuation, devaluations and conversion restrictions;  ·governmental activities that limit or disrupt markets, restrict payments or limit the movement of funds; and  ·trade restrictions and economic embargoes by the United States or other countries.Fluctuations in the price and supply of raw materials and natural gas for our business segments may adversely affect our operations.We purchase a wide variety of raw materials for our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment to manufacture our products, including steel, aluminum and copper. Unanticipated increases in raw material requirements or price increases could increase production costs and adversely affect profitability. In our Galvanizing Service Segment, zinc and natural gas represent a large portion of our cost of sales. The prices of zinc and natural gas are highly volatile. The following factors, which are beyond our control, affect the price of raw materials and natural gas for our business segments: supply and demand; freight costs and transportation availability; trade duties and taxes; and labor disputes. We seek to maintain operating margins by attempting to increase the price of our products and services in response to increased costs, but may not be successful in passing these price increases through to our customers.Our volume of fixed-price contracts for our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment could adversely affect our business.We currently generate, and expect to continue to generate, a significant portion of our revenues under fixed price contracts. We must estimate the costs of completing a particular project to bid for fixed-price contracts. The actual cost of labor and materials, however, may vary from the costs we originally estimated. Depending on the size of a particular project, variations from estimated cost could have a significant impact on our operating results for any fiscal year.Our compliance with various governmental regulations and environmental risks may increase our costs and potentially lower demand for our products.Our business is subject to numerous federal, state, provincial, local and foreign laws and regulations, including regulations, primarily in our Galvanizing Services Segment, with respect to air emissions, storm water runoff and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of waste materials. Although we believe we are substantially in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, and the presently unpredictable ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements could adversely impact our operations. We may be required to make significant expenditures to comply with governmental laws and regulations. Existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, or future laws or regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  6  On December 15, 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) officially published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other “greenhouse gases” present an endangerment to human health and the environment because emissions of such gases are contributing to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. These findings by the EPA allow the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. In late September 2009, the EPA had proposed two sets of regulations in anticipation of finalizing its findings that would require a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and that could also lead to the imposition of greenhouse gas emission limitations in Clean Air Act permits for certain stationary sources. In addition, on September 22, 2009, the EPA issued a final rule requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the United States beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010. The adoption and implementation of any regulations over greenhouse gases could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that may be associated with our operations.  Currently the Company does not have any sites that are required to report such emissions under the new EPA climate registry regulation. The Company does not expect the regulation to have a significant impact from a cost or operations perspective, but will continue to monitor proposed legislation and regulation and its impact.   On June 26, 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the “American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009,” or “ACESA,” which would establish an economy-wide cap-and-trade program to reduce U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide and methane. ACESA would require a 17% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels by 2020 and just over an 80% reduction of such emissions by 2050. Under this legislation, the EPA would issue a capped and steadily declining number of tradable emissions allowances to certain major sources of greenhouse gas emissions so that such sources could continue to emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These allowances would be expected to escalate significantly in cost over time. The net effect of ACESA will be to impose increasing costs on the combustion of carbon-based fuels such as oil, refined petroleum products, and natural gas. The U.S. Senate has begun work on its own legislation for restricting domestic greenhouse gas emissions and the President Obama Administration has indicated its support of legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through an emission allowance system. Although it is not possible at this time to predict when the Senate may act on climate change legislation or how any bill passed by the Senate would be reconciled with ACESA, any future federal laws or implementing regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that may be associated with our operations.Our acquisition strategy involves a number of risks.We intend to pursue growth through the pursuit of opportunities to acquire companies or assets that will enable us to expand our product and service offerings.  We routinely review potential acquisitions.  However, we may be unable to implement this growth strategy if we cannot reach agreement on potential strategic acquisitions on acceptable terms or for other reasons.  Moreover, our acquisition strategy involves certain risks, including:  ·difficulties in the integration of operations and systems;  ·the termination of relationships by key personnel and customers of the acquired company;  ·a failure to add additional employees to handle the increased volume of business;  ·additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management and financial reporting;  ·risks and liabilities from our acquisitions, some of which may not be discovered during our due diligence;  ·a disruption of our ongoing business or an inability of our ongoing business to receive sufficient management attention; and  ·a failure to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated.Future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on attractive terms.  7  Our use of percentage-of-completion accounting in the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits.As discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, a portion of our revenues is recognized on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting.  The percentage-of-completion accounting practice we use results in our recognizing contract revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs.  The earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenues, costs and profitability.  Contract losses are recognized in full when determined, and contract profit estimates are adjusted based on ongoing reviews of contract profitability.  Actual collection of contract amounts or change orders could differ from estimated amounts and could result in a reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings.  In certain circumstances, it is possible that such adjustments could be significant.We may not be able to fully realize the revenue value reported in our backlog for our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment.We have a backlog of work in our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment.  Orders included in our backlog are represented by customer purchase orders and contracts, which we believe to be firm.  Backlog develops as a result of new business secured, which represents the revenue value of new project commitments received by us during a given period.  Backlog consists of projects which have either (1) not yet been started or (2) are in progress and are not yet complete.  In the latter case, the revenue value reported in backlog is the remaining value associated with work that has not yet been completed.  From time to time, projects that were recorded as new business are cancelled.  In the event of a project cancellation, we may be reimbursed for certain costs but typically have no contractual right to the total revenue reflected in our backlog.  In addition to being unable to recover certain direct costs, we may also incur additional costs resulting from underutilized assets if projects are cancelled.Our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.Our quarterly results may be materially and adversely affected by:  ·the timing and volume of work under new agreements;  ·general economic conditions;  ·inclement weather, such as that which affected much of the continental United States during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2011;  ·the budgetary spending patterns of customers;  ·variations in the margins of projects performed during any particular quarter;  ·losses experienced in our operations not otherwise covered by insurance;  ·a change in the demand or production of our products and our services caused by severe weather conditions;  ·a change in the mix of our customers, contracts and business;  ·a change in customer delivery schedule;  ·increases in design and manufacturing costs; and  ·abilities of customers to pay their invoices owed to us.Accordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results expected for any other quarter or for the entire year.We may be unsuccessful at generating internal growth.Our ability to generate internal growth will be affected by, among other factors, our ability to:  ·attract new customers, internationally and domestically;  ·potential regulatory changes;  ·increase the number or size of projects performed for existing customers;  ·hire and retain employees; and  ·increase volume utilizing our existing facilities.  8  Many of the factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth may be beyond our control, and we cannot be certain that our strategies will be successful or that we will be able to generate cash flow sufficient to fund our operations and to support internal growth.  If we are unsuccessful, we may not be able to achieve internal growth, expand our operations or grow our business.The departure of key personnel could disrupt our business.We depend on the continued efforts of our executive officers and senior management.  We cannot be certain that any individual will continue in such capacity for any particular period of time.  The loss of key personnel, or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees, could negatively impact our ability to manage our business.Our business requires skilled labor, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees.Our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability will be limited by our ability to employ, train and retain skilled personnel necessary to meet our requirements.  We may experience shortages of qualified personnel.   We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an adequately skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy or that our labor expense will not increase as a result of shortage in the supply of skilled personnel.

Our business is subject to a variety of risks, including the risks described below, which we believe are the most significant risks and uncertainties facing our business. However, they are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or not described below may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted and our future growth could be impacted as well.The current worldwide financial crisis and economic downturn may likely affect our customer base and suppliers and could materially affect our backlog and profits. The current worldwide financial crisis has reduced the availability of liquidity and credit, including letters of credit and surety bonds, to fund or support the continuation and expansion of industrial business operations worldwide. Recent financial market conditions have resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions, and have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital, to merge with larger and stronger institutions and, in some cases, to fail. Many lenders and institutional investors have reduced and, in some cases, ceased to provide funding to borrowers. Continued disruption of the credit markets could adversely affect our customers’ or our own letter of credit and surety bonding capacity, which support the continuation and expansion of projects worldwide and could result in contract cancellations or suspensions or project delays. If one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors experiences difficulties that result in a reduction or interruption in supply to us, or they fail to meet any of our manufacturing requirements, our business could be adversely impacted until we are able to secure alternative sources, if any. Furthermore, our ability to expand our business would be limited if, in the future, we are unable to increase our bonding capacity or our credit facility on favorable terms or at all. These disruptions could lead to a lower demand for our services and could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock.Our business segments operate in highly competitive markets.Many of our competitors, primarily in our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment, are significantly larger and have substantially more resources than we do.

In our Galvanizing Service Segment, zinc and natural gas represent a large portion of our cost of sales. The prices of zinc and natural gas are highly volatile. The following factors, which are beyond our control, affect the price of raw materials and natural gas for our business segments: supply and demand; freight costs and transportation availability; trade duties and taxes; and labor disputes. We seek to maintain operating margins by attempting to increase the price of our products and services in response to increased costs, but may not be successful in passing these price increases through to our customers.Our dependence upon fixed-price contracts for our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment could adversely affect our business.We currently generate, and expect to continue to generate, a significant portion of our revenues under fixed price contracts. We must estimate the costs of completing a particular project to bid for fixed-price contracts. The actual cost of labor and materials, however, may vary from the costs we originally estimated. Depending on the size of a particular project, variations from estimated cost could have a significant impact on our operating results for any fiscal year.Our compliance with various governmental regulations and environmental risks may increase our costs and potentially lower demand for our products.Our business is subject to numerous federal, state, provincial, local and foreign laws and regulations, including regulations, primarily in our Galvanizing Services Segment, with respect to air emissions, storm water runoff and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of waste materials. Although we believe we are substantially in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, and the presently unpredictable ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements could adversely impact our operations. We may be required to make significant expenditures to comply with governmental laws and regulations. Existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, or future laws or regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.   6   On December 15, 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) officially published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other “greenhouse gases” present an endangerment to human health and the environment because emissions of such gases are contributing to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. These findings by the EPA allow the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. In late September 2009, the EPA had proposed two sets of regulations in anticipation of finalizing its findings that would require a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and that could also lead to the imposition of greenhouse gas emission limitations in Clean Air Act permits for certain stationary sources. In addition, on September 22, 2009, the EPA issued a final rule requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the United States beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010. The adoption and implementation of any regulations over greenhouse gases could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that may be associated with our operations.  Currently the Company does not have any sites that are required to report such emissions under the new EPA climate registry regulation. The Company does not expect the regulation to have a significant impact from a cost or operations perspective, but will continue to monitor proposed legislation and regulation and its impact.   On June 26, 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the “American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009,” or “ACESA,” which would establish an economy-wide cap-and-trade program to reduce U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide and methane. ACESA would require a 17% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels by 2020 and just over an 80% reduction of such emissions by 2050. Under this legislation, the EPA would issue a capped and steadily declining number of tradable emissions allowances to certain major sources of greenhouse gas emissions so that such sources could continue to emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These allowances would be expected to escalate significantly in cost over time. The net effect of ACESA will be to impose increasing costs on the combustion of carbon-based fuels such as oil, refined petroleum products, and natural gas. The U.S. Senate has begun work on its own legislation for restricting domestic greenhouse gas emissions and the President Obama Administration has indicated its support of legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through an emission allowance system. Although it is not possible at this time to predict when the Senate may act on climate change legislation or how any bill passed by the Senate would be reconciled with ACESA, any future federal laws or implementing regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that may be associated with our operations.Our acquisition strategy involves a number of risks.We intend to pursue growth through the pursuit of opportunities to acquire companies or assets that will enable us to expand our product and service offerings.  We routinely review potential acquisitions.  However, we may be unable to implement this growth strategy if we cannot reach agreement on potential strategic acquisitions on acceptable terms or for other reasons.  Moreover, our acquisition strategy involves certain risks, including:  ·difficulties in the integration of operations and systems;  ·the termination of relationships by key personnel and customers of the acquired company;  ·a failure to add additional employees to handle the increased volume of business;  ·additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management and financial reporting;  ·risks and liabilities from our acquisitions, some of which may not be discovered during our due diligence;  ·a disruption of our ongoing business or an inability of our ongoing business to receive sufficient management attention; and  ·a failure to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated.Future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on attractive terms.  7  Our use of percentage-of-completion accounting in the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits.As discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, a portion of our revenues is recognized on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting.  The percentage-of-completion accounting practice we use results in our recognizing contract revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs.  The earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenues, costs and profitability.  Contract losses are recognized in full when determined, and contract profit estimates are adjusted based on ongoing reviews of contract profitability.  Actual collection of contract amounts or change orders could differ from estimated amounts and could result in a reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings.  In certain circumstances, it is possible that such adjustments could be significant.We may not be able to fully realize the revenue value reported in our backlog for our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment.We have a backlog of work in our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment.  Orders included in our backlog are represented by customer purchase orders and contracts, which we believe to be firm.  Backlog develops as a result of new business secured, which represents the revenue value of new project commitments received by us during a given period.  Backlog consists of projects which have either (1) not yet been started or (2) are in progress and are not yet complete.  In the latter case, the revenue value reported in backlog is the remaining value associated with work that has not yet been completed.  From time to time, projects that were recorded as new business are cancelled.  In the event of a project cancellation, we may be reimbursed for certain costs but typically have no contractual right to the total revenue reflected in our backlog.  In addition to being unable to recover certain direct costs, we may also incur additional costs resulting from underutilized assets if projects are cancelled.Our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.Our quarterly results may be materially and adversely affected by:  ·the timing and volume of work under new agreements;  ·general economic conditions;  ·the budgetary spending patterns of customers;  ·variations in the margins of projects performed during any particular quarter;  ·losses experienced in our operations not otherwise covered by insurance;  ·a change in the demand or production of our products and our services caused by severe weather conditions;  ·a change in the mix of our customers, contracts and business;  ·a change in customer delivery schedule;  ·increases in design and manufacturing costs; and  ·abilities of customers to pay their invoices owed to us.Accordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results that you can expect for any other quarter or for the entire year.We may be unsuccessful at generating internal growth.Our ability to generate internal growth will be affected by, among other factors, our ability to:  ·attract new customers, internationally and domestically;  ·increase the number or size of projects performed for existing customers;  ·hire and retain employees; and  ·increase volume utilizing our existing facilities.  8  Many of the factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth may be beyond our control, and we cannot be certain that our strategies will be successful or that we will be able to generate cash flow sufficient to fund our operations and to support internal growth.  If we are unsuccessful, we may not be able to achieve internal growth, expand our operations or grow our business.The departure of key personnel could disrupt our business.We depend on the continued efforts of our executive officers and senior management.  We cannot be certain that any individual will continue in such capacity for any particular period of time.  The loss of key personnel, or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees, could negatively impact our ability to manage our business.Our business requires skilled labor, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees.Our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability will be limited by our ability to employ, train and retain skilled personnel necessary to meet our requirements.  We may experience shortages of qualified personnel.   We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an adequately skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy or that our labor expense will not increase as a result of shortage in the supply of skilled personnel. Labor shortages or increased labor costs could impair our ability to maintain our business or grow our revenues.Actual and potential claims, lawsuits, and proceedings could ultimately reduce our profitability and liquidity and weaken our financial condition.In the future, the Company could be named as a defendant in legal proceedings claiming damages from us in connection with the operation of our business.  Most of the actions against us arise out of the normal course of our performing services or manufacturing equipment.  We are and will likely continue to be a plaintiff in legal proceedings against customers, in which we seek to recover payments of contractual amounts due to us, as well as claims for increased costs incurred by us.  When appropriate, we establish provisions against certain legal exposures, and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to ongoing developments related to each exposure.  If in the future our assumptions and estimates related to such exposures prove to be inadequate or incorrect, our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.  In addition, claims, lawsuits and proceedings may harm our reputation and possibly divert management resources away from operating our business.Technological innovations by competitors may make existing products and production methods obsolete.All of the products manufactured and sold by the Company depend upon the best available technology for success in the marketplace.  The competitive environment is highly sensitive to technological innovation in both segments of our business.  It is possible for our competitors to develop new products or production methods, which will make current products or methods obsolete or at least hasten their obsolescence.Catastrophic events could disrupt our business.The occurrence of catastrophic events ranging from natural disasters such as hurricanes to epidemics such as health epidemics to acts of war and terrorism could disrupt or delay our ability to complete projects and could potentially expose the Company to third-party liability claims.  Such events may or may not be fully covered by our various insurance policies or may be subject to deductibles.  In addition, such events could impact our customers and suppliers, resulting in temporary or long-term delays and/or cancellations of orders or raw materials used in normal business operations.  These situations are outside the Company’s control and could have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations.Legislation regarding the health care industry may impact our business.In March 2010, Congress passed, and the President signed, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. This act may have a significant impact on health care providers, insurers and others associated with the health care industry. We are currently evaluating the impact of this comprehensive act on our business. Federal and state governments may propose other health care initiatives and revisions to the health care and health insurance systems. It is uncertain what legislative programs, if any will be adopted in the future, or what action Congress or state legislatures may take regarding other health care reform proposals or legislation. In addition, changes in the health care industry, such as the growth of managed care organizations and provider networks, may increase our health care costs.  9  Our pending acquisition of North American Galvanizing & Coatings, Inc. may not be completed and, if it is, it may have unexpected consequences or impose additional costs on us.  On April 1, 2010, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire North American Galvanizing & Coatings, Inc. We expect to complete the acquisition during the second quarter of fiscal 2011. There is no assurance, however, that the acquisition will be consummated. If is completed, the acquisition involves numerous risks, including the following:  ·difficulties in integration of the operations, technologies and products and services of the acquired companies;  ·the risk of diverting management’s attention from normal daily operations of the business;  ·potential cost and disruptions caused by the integration of financial reporting systems and development of uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;  ·accounting consequences, including expensing of acquisition cost, amortization of acquired intangible assets or other required purchase accounting adjustments, resulting in variability or reductions of our reported earnings;  ·potential difficulties in completing projects associated with purchased in-process research and development;  ·risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in these markets have stronger market positions;  ·the potential loss of our key employees or those of the acquired company due to the employment uncertainties inherent in the acquisition process;  ·the assumption of known and potentially unknown liabilities of the acquired company;  ·the risk that we may find that the acquired company or business does not further our business strategy or that we paid more than what the company or business was worth;  ·our relationship with current and new employees and customers could be impaired;  ·the acquisition may result in litigation from terminated employees or third parties who believe a claim against us would be valuable to pursue, and litigation challenging the transaction instituted after the acquisition was announced could be resolved unfavorably to us;  ·our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with product quality, product architecture and legal contingencies, among other matters; and  ·there may be insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions.Acquisitions may also cause us to record goodwill and intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing and potential periodic impairment charges; incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets; or incur other large and immediate write-offs"

We are an electricalequipment and components manufacturer, serving the global markets of powergeneration, transmission and distribution, and the general industrial markets,and a leading provider of hot dip galvanizing services to the steel fabricationmarket nationwide.  We offer products through two distinct businesssegments, the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment and the GalvanizingServices Segment.Electricaland Industrial Products SegmentOurElectrical and Industrial Products Segment produces highly engineered specialtyelectrical products and  industrial lighting and tubular products, allof which we market and sell both in domestic and international markets. Ourelectrical products are designed, manufactured and configured to distributeelectrical power to and from generators, transformers, switching devices andother electrical configurations and are supplied to the power generation,transmission and distribution markets and also to the general industrialmarket.  Our industrial products include industrial lighting andtubular products used for petro-chemical and industrial applications. We providelighting products to the petroleum and food processing industries, and to otherindustries with unique lighting challenges.  We also provide tubularproducts to the petroleum industry.Themarkets for our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment are highlycompetitive and consist of a few large multi-national companies, along withnumerous small independent companies.  Competition is based primarilyon product quality, range of product line, price and service.  Whilesome of our competitors are much larger and better financed than us, we believethat we can compete favorably with them.Copper,aluminum and steel are the primary raw materials used by this segment. All ofthese raw materials are currently readily available.  Because theElectrical and Industrial Products Segment does not commit contractually tominimum volumes, increases in price for these items are normally managed throughescalation clauses to the customer's contracts, although during difficult marketconditions customer may resist these escalation clauses. 1 We sellthis segment's products through manufacturers' representatives, distributors,agents and our internal sales force.  We are not dependent on anysingle customer for this segment, and the loss of any single customer would nothave a material adverse effect on our consolidated revenues or netincome.Backlogof orders for the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment was approximately$174.8 million at February 28, 2009, $134.9 million at February 29, 2008, and$120.7million at February 28, 2007. The majority of the backlog as of February 28,2009 should be delivered during the next 18 months.  We believe thatthe contracts and purchase orders included in the backlog are firm.Weemployed a total of 815 people in thissegment as of February 28, 2009.GalvanizingServices SegmentTheGalvanizing Services Segment provides hot dip galvanizing to the steelfabrication industry through facilities located throughout the South, Midwestand Southwest United States.    Hot dip galvanizing is ametallurgical process in which molten zinc is applied to a customer's material.The zinc bonding renders corrosion protection to fabricated steel for extendedperiods of up to 50 years.  As of February 28, 2009, we operatedtwenty galvanizing plants, which are located in Texas, Louisiana, Alabama,Mississippi, Arkansas, Arizona, Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Oklahoma andMinnesota.Galvanizingis a highly competitive business, and we compete with other galvanizingcompanies, captive galvanizing facilities operated by manufacturers, andalternate forms of corrosion protection such as paint.  Ourgalvanizing markets are generally limited to areas within relatively closeproximity to our galvanizing plants due to freight cost.Zinc, theprincipal raw material used in the galvanizing process, is currently readilyavailable, but has volatile pricing.  We manage our exposure tocommodity pricing of zinc by utilizing agreements with zinc suppliers thatinclude protective caps and fixed costs contracts to guard against escalatingcommodity prices.Wetypically serve fabricators or manufacturers that provide services to theelectrical and telecommunications, bridge and highway, petrochemical and generalindustrial markets, and numerous original equipment manufacturers(“OEMs”).  We do not depend on any single customer for our galvanizingservices, and the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverseeffect on our consolidated revenues or net income.Thebacklog of galvanizing orders generally is nominal due to the short timerequirement involved in the process.Weemployed a total of 907 people in thissegment as of February 28, 2009. 2 ExecutiveOfficers of the Registrant Name AgeBusiness      Experience for Past Five YearsPosition or Office with Registrant or Prior      Employer Held Since                            David      H.

However, they are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks anduncertainties not known to us or not described below may also impair ourbusiness operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business,financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted andour future growth could be impacted as well.Thecurrent worldwide financial crisis and economic downturn may likely affect ourcustomer base and suppliers and could materially affect our backlog andprofits. Thecurrent worldwide financial crisis has reduced the availability of liquidity andcredit, including letters of credit and surety bonds, to fund or support thecontinuation and expansion of industrial business operations worldwide. Recentfinancial market conditions have resulted in significant write-downs of assetvalues by financial institutions, and have caused many financial institutions toseek additional capital, to merge with larger and stronger institutions and, insome cases, to fail. Many lenders and institutional investors have reduced and,in some cases, ceased to provide funding to borrowers. Continued disruption ofthe credit markets could adversely affect our customers’ or our own letter ofcredit and surety bonding capacity, which support the continuation and expansionof projects worldwide and could result in contract cancellations or suspensionsor project delays. If one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors experiencesdifficulties that result in a reduction or interruption in supply to us, or theyfail to meet any of our manufacturing requirements, our business could beadversely impacted until we are able to secure alternative sources, if any.Furthermore, our ability to expand our business would be limited if, in thefuture, we are unable to increase our bonding capacity or our credit facility onfavorable terms or at all. These disruptions could lead to a lower demand forour services and could materially impact our business, financial condition andresults of operations or the trading price of our commonstock.TheU.S. government’s proposed plan to address the financial crises may not beeffective to stabilize the financial markets or to increase the availability ofcredit. Inresponse to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financialmarkets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financialinstitutions, legislation was enacted that provides the U.S. Treasury theauthority to, among other things, purchase mortgage-backed and other securitiesfrom financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing the financialmarkets. Since enactment of the legislation, the capital markets have continuedto experience extreme levels of volatility and the credit markets have not yetshown any significant increase in the availability of credit. There can be noassurance what impact this legislation ultimately will have on the financialmarkets. If actions taken pursuant to the legislation are not successful instabilizing the financial markets and increasing the availability of credit, itcould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition andresults of operations or the trading price of our commonstock.Ourbusiness segments operate in highly competitive markets.Many ofour competitors, primarily in our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment,are significantly larger and have substantially more resources than we do.Competition is based on a number of factors, including price. Certain of ourcompetitors may have lower cost structures and may, therefore, be able toprovide their products and services at lower pricing than we are able toprovide. We cannot be certain that our competitors will not develop theexpertise, experience and resources to provide services that are superior inboth price and quality. Similarly, we cannot be certain that we will be ableto maintain or enhance our competitive position within our industries, maintainour customer base at current levels or increase our customerbase. 5 Ourbusiness segments are sensitive to economic downturns.If thegeneral level of economic activity deteriorates from current levels, ourcustomers may delay or cancel new projects. If there is a reduction in demandfor our products or services, as a result of a downturn in the general economy,there could be a material adverse effect on price levels and the quantity ofgoods and services purchased, therefore adversely impacting revenues and resultsfrom operations. A number of factors, including financing conditions andpotential bankruptcies in the industries we serve, could adversely affect ourcustomers and their ability or willingness to fund capital expenditures in thefuture and pay for past services.Internationaland political events may adversely affect our Electrical and Industrial ProductsSegment.A portionof the revenues from our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment are frominternational markets. The occurrence of any of the risks described below couldhave an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows andfinancial condition:       ·political      and economic instability;       ·social      unrest, acts of terrorism, force majeure, war or other armed      conflict;       ·inflation;       ·currency      fluctuation, devaluations and conversion  restrictions;       ·governmental      activities that limit or disrupt markets, restrict payments or limit the      movement of funds; and       ·trade      restrictions and economic embargoes by the United States or other      countries.Fluctuationsin the price and supply of raw materials and natural gas for our businesssegments may adversely affect our operations.Wepurchase a wide variety of raw materials for our Electrical and IndustrialProducts Segment to manufacture our products, including steel, aluminum andcopper. Unanticipated increases in raw material requirements or price increasescould increase production costs and adversely affect profitability. In ourGalvanizing Service Segment, zinc and natural gas represent a large portion ofour cost of sales. The prices of zinc and natural gas are highly volatile. Thefollowing factors, which are beyond our control, affect the price of rawmaterials and natural gas for our business segments: supply and demand; freightcosts and transportation availability; inventory levels; trade duties and taxes;and labor disputes. We seek to maintain operating margins by attempting toincrease the price of our products and services in response to increased costs,but may not be successful in passing these price increases through to ourcustomers.Ourdependence upon fixed-price contracts for our Electrical and Industrial ProductsSegment could adversely affect our business.Wecurrently generate, and expect to continue to generate, a significant portion ofour revenues under fixed price contracts. We must estimate the costs ofcompleting a particular project to bid for fixed-price contracts. The actualcost of labor and materials, however, may vary from the costs we originallyestimated. Depending on the size of a particular project, variations fromestimated cost could have a significant impact on our operating results for anyfiscal year.Ourcompliance with various governmental regulations and environmental risks mayincrease our costs.Ourbusiness is subject to numerous federal, state, provincial, local and foreignlaws and regulations, including regulations, primarily in our GalvanizingServices Segment, with respect to air emissions, storm water runoff and thegeneration, handling, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of wastematerials. Although we believe we are substantially in compliance with allapplicable laws and regulations, legal requirements are frequently changed andsubject to interpretation, and the presently unpredictable ultimate cost ofcompliance with these requirements could adversely impact our operations. We maybe required to make significant expenditures to comply with governmentallaws andregulations. Existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted orreinterpreted in the future, or future laws or regulations, could have amaterial adverse effect on our results of operations and financialcondition.  6 Ouracquisition strategy involves a number of risks.We intendto pursue growth through the pursuit of opportunities to acquire companies orassets that will enable us to expand our product and serviceofferings.  We routinely review potentialacquisitions.  However, we may be unable to implement this growthstrategy if we cannot reach agreement on potential strategic acquisitions onacceptable terms or for other reasons.  Moreover, our acquisitionstrategy involves certain risks, including:       ·difficulties      in the integration of operations andsystems;       ·the      termination of relationships by key personnel and customers of the      acquired company;       ·a      failure to add additional employees to handle the increased volume of      business;       ·additional      financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax      planning, treasury management and financial  reporting;       ·risks      and liabilities from our acquisitions, some of which may not be discovered      during our due diligence;       ·a      disruption of our ongoing business or an inability of our ongoing business      to receive sufficient management attention;and       ·a      failure to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we      anticipated.Futureacquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, whichmay not be available on attractive terms.Ouruse of percentage-of-completion accounting in the Electrical and IndustrialProducts Segment could result in a reduction or elimination of previouslyreported profits.Asdiscussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition andResults of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” and in thenotes to our consolidated financial statements, a portion of our revenues isrecognized on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting.  Thepercentage-of-completion accounting practice we use results in our recognizingcontract revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion toour incurrence of contract costs.  The earnings or losses recognizedon individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenues, costs andprofitability.  Contract losses are recognized in full whendetermined, and contract profit estimates are adjusted based on ongoing reviewsof contract profitability.  Actual collection of contract amounts orchange orders could differ from estimated amounts and could result in areduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings.  Incertain circumstances, it is possible that such adjustments could besignificant.Wemay not be able to fully realize the revenue value reported in our backlog forour Electrical and Industrial Products Segment.We have abacklog of work in our Electrical and Industrial ProductsSegment.  Orders included in our backlog are represented by customerpurchase orders and contracts, which we believe to be firm.  Backlogdevelops as a result of new business secured, which represents the revenue valueof new project commitments received by us during a givenperiod.  Backlog consists of projects which have either (1) not yetbeen started or (2) are in progress and are not yet complete.  In thelatter case, the revenue value reported in backlog is the remaining valueassociated with work that has not yet been completed.  From time totime, projects are cancelled that appeared to have a high certainty of goingforward at the time they were recorded as new business is taken.  Inthe event of a project cancellation, we may be reimbursed for certain costs buttypically have no contractual right to the total revenue reflected in ourbacklog.  In addition to being unable to recover certain direct costs,we may also incur additional costs resulting from underutilized assets ifprojects are cancelled. 7 Ouroperating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.Ourquarterly results may be materially and adversely affected by:       ·the      timing and volume of work under newagreements;       ·general      economic conditions;       ·the      budgetary spending patterns ofcustomers;       ·variations      in the margins of projects performed during any particular      quarter;       ·losses      experienced in our operations not otherwise covered by      insurance;       ·a      change in the demand or production of our products and our services caused      by severe weather conditions;       ·a      change in the mix of our customers, contracts and  business;       ·a      change in customer deliveryschedule;       ·increases      in design and manufacturing costs;and       ·abilities      of customers to pay their invoices owed tous.Accordingly,our operating results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of theresults that you can expect for any other quarter or for the entireyear.Wemay be unsuccessful at generating internal growth.Ourability to generate internal growth will be affected by, among other factors,our ability to:       ·attract      new customers, internationally anddomestically;       ·increase      the number or size of projects performed for existing      customers;       ·hire      and retain employees; and       ·increase      volume utilizing our existingfacilities.Many ofthe factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth may be beyond ourcontrol, and we cannot be certain that our strategies will be successful or thatwe will be able to generate cash flow sufficient to fund our operations and tosupport internal growth.  If we are unsuccessful, we may not be ableto achieve internal growth, expand our operations or grow ourbusiness.Thedeparture of key personnel could disrupt our business.We dependon the continued efforts of our executive officers and seniormanagement.  We cannot be certain that any individual will continue insuch capacity for any particular period of time.  The loss of keypersonnel, or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees, couldnegatively impact our ability to manage our business.Ourbusiness requires skilled labor, and we may be unable to attract and retainqualified employees.Ourability to maintain our productivity and profitability will be limited by ourability to employ, train and retain skilled personnel necessary to meet ourrequirements.  We may experience shortages of qualifiedpersonnel.   We cannot be certain that we will be able tomaintain an adequately skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently andto support our growth

Competition depends on a number of factors, including price. Certain of our competitors may have lower cost structures and may, therefore, be able to provide their products and services at lower rates than we are able to provide. We cannot becertain that our competitors will not develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both price and quality. Similarly, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitiveposition within our industries, maintain our customer base at current levels or increase our customer base.   4 Table of ContentsOur business segments are sensitive to economic downturns  If the general level of economic activity deteriorates from current levels, our customers may delay or cancel new projects. If there is a reduction indemand for our products or services, as result of a downturn in the general economy, there could be a material adverse effect on price levels and the quantity of goods and services purchased, therefore adversely impacting revenues and results fromoperations. A number of factors, including financing conditions and potential bankruptcies in the industries we serve, could adversely affect our customers and their ability or willingness to fund capital expenditures in the future and pay for pastservices.  International and political events may adversely affect our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment  A portion of our revenues from our Electrical and Industrial Segment are from international markets. We operate in developed countries with stableoperating and fiscal environments. The occurrence of any of the risks described below could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition:     political and economic instability;     social unrest, acts of terrorism, force majeure, war or other armed conflict;     inflation;     currency fluctuation, devaluations and conversion restrictions;     governmental activities that limit or disrupt markets, restrict payments or limit the movement of funds; and     trade restrictions and economic embargoes by the Untied States or other countries.  Fluctuations in the price and supply of raw materials and natural gas for our business segments  We purchase a wide variety of raw materials for our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment to manufacture our products including steel, aluminum and copper. Unanticipated increases in raw material requirements or price increases couldincrease production costs and adversely affect profitability. In our Galvanizing Service Segment zinc and natural gas represent a large portion of our cost of sales. The price and availability of zinc and natural gas is highly competitive andcyclical. The following factors which our beyond our control affect the price of raw materials and natural gas for our business segments are: supply and demand factors; freight costs and transportation availability; inventory levels; trade dutiesand taxes; and labor disputes. We seek to maintain operating margins by attempting to increase the price of our products and services in response to increased costs, but may not be successful in passing these price increases through to ourcustomers.  Our dependence upon fixed-price contracts for our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment could adversely affect our business We currently generate, and expect to continue to generate, a significant portion of our revenues under fixed price contracts. Wemust estimate the costs of completing a particular project to bid for fixed-price contracts. The actual cost of labor and materials, however, may vary from the costs we originally estimated. Depending on the size of particular project, variationsfrom estimated cost could have a significant impact on our operating results for any fiscal year.  Our compliance with various governmentalregulations and environmental risks  Our business is subject to numerous federal, state, provincial, local and foreign laws andregulations, including regulations, primarily in our Galvanizing Services Segment, with respect to air emissions, storm water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of waste materials. Although, we   5 Table of Contentsbelieve we are substantially in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation,and the presently unpredictable ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements could adversely impact our operations. We may be required to make significant expenditures to comply with governmental laws and regulations. Existing laws orregulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, or future laws or regulations, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial conditions.  Our acquisition strategy involves a number of risks  We intend to pursue growth through the pursuit of opportunities to acquire companies or assets that will enable us to expand our product and service offerings. We routinely review potential acquisitions. However, we may be unable toimplement this growth strategy if we cannot reach agreement on potential strategic acquisitions on acceptable terms or for other reasons. Moreover, our acquisition strategy involves certain risks, including:     difficulties in the integration of operations and systems;     the termination of relationships by key personnel and customers of the acquired company;     a failure to add additional employees to handle the increased volume of business;     additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management and financial reporting;     risks and liabilities from our acquisitions, some of which may not be discovered during our due diligence;     a disruption of our ongoing business or an inability of our ongoing business to receive sufficient management attention; and     a failure to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated.  Future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on attractive terms.  Our use of percentage-of-completion accounting in the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits  As discussed in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies andEstimates and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, a portion of our revenues is recognized on a percentage-of-completion method of accounting. The percentage-of-completion accounting practice we use results in our recognizingcontract revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs. The earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenues, costs and profitability. Contractlosses are recognized in full when determined, and contract profit estimates are adjusted based on ongoing reviews of contract profitability. Actual collection of contract amounts or change orders could differ from estimated amounts and could resultin a reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings. In certain circumstances, it is possible that such adjustments could be significant.  We may not be able to fully realize the revenue value reported in our backlog for our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment  We have a backlog of work in our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment to be completed on contracts. Orders included in our backlog are represented by customer purchase orders and contracts, which we believe tobe firm. Backlog develops as a result of new business taken, which represents the revenue value of new project commitments received by us during a given period.

In the latter case, the revenue value reported in backlog is the remaining valueassociated with work that has not yet been completed. From time to time, projects are canceled that appeared to have a high certainty of going forward at the time they were recorded as new business taken. In the event of a project cancellation, wemay be reimbursed for certain costs but typically have no contractual right to the total revenue reflected in our backlog. In addition to being unable to recover certain direct costs, canceled projects may also result in additional unrecoverablecosts due to the resulting underutilization of our assets.  Our Operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter Our quarterly results may be materially and adversely affected by:     the timing and volume of work under new agreements;     general economic conditions;     the budgetary spending patterns of customers;     variations in the margins of projects performed during any particular quarter;     losses experienced in our operations not otherwise covered by insurance;     a change in the demand or production of our products and our services caused by severe weather conditions;     a change in the mix of our customers, contracts and business;     a change in customer delivery schedule;     increases in design and manufacturing costs; and     ability of customers to pay their invoices owed to us.

Inaddition, our customers may reduce the number or size of projects available to us. Many of the factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth may be beyond our control, and we cannot be certain that our strategies will be successful orthat we will be able to generate cash flow sufficient to fund our operations and to support internal growth. If we are unsuccessful, we may not be able to achieve internal growth, expand our operations or grow our business.  The departure of key personnel could disrupt our business  We depend on the continued efforts of our executive officers and senior management. We cannot be certain that any individual will continue in such capacity for any particular period of time. The loss of key personnel,or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees, could negatively impact our ability to manage our business.   7 Table of ContentsOur business requires skilled labor , and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees Our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability will be limited by our ability to employ, train and retain skilledpersonnel necessary to meet our requirements. We may experience shortages of qualified personnel. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an adequate skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growthstrategy or that our labor expense will not increase as a result of shortage in the supply of skilled personnel.
