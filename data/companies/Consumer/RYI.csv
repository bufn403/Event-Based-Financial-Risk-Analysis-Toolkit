4,RYI,RYERSON HOLDING CORP,2024-02-21,"ITEM 1A.	RISK FACTORS. Our business faces many risks. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the other information in this report, including the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors below will not occur. These risks could have a material and adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRYWeakness in the economy, market trends, and other conditions affecting the profitability and financial stability of our customers could negatively impact our sales growth and results of operations. Economic and industry trends affect our business environments. We serve several metals-consuming industries in which the demand for our products and services is sensitive to the production activity, capital spending, and demand for products and services of our customers. Many of these customers operate in markets that are subject to highly cyclical fluctuations resulting from seasonality, market uncertainty, costs of goods sold, currency exchange rates, foreign competition, offshoring of production, oil and natural gas prices, geopolitical developments, and a variety of other factors beyond our control. Any of these factors could cause customers to idle or close facilities, delay purchases, reduce production levels, or experience reductions in the demand for their own products or services.Any of these events could impair the ability of our customers to make full and timely payments or reduce the volume of products and services these customers purchase from us and could cause increased pressure on our selling prices and terms of sale. We do not expect the cyclical nature of our industry to change and any downturn in our customers’ industries could reduce our revenues and profitability or a significant or prolonged slowdown in activity in the U.S., Canada, or any other major world economy, or a segment of any such economy, could negatively impact our sales growth and results of operations.The metals services business is very competitive and increased competition could reduce our revenues and gross margins. We face competition in all markets we serve, from metals producers that sell directly to certain customers or segments of the market, to other metal services companies. The metals services industry itself is highly fragmented and competitive. There are a few large competitors, but most of the market is served by small local and regional competitors. Competition is based principally on price, service, quality, production capabilities, inventory availability, and timely delivery. We are experiencing increased pressure from online businesses that compete with price transparency. We expect technological advancements and the increased use of e-commerce solutions within the industry to continue to evolve at a rapid pace. As a result, our ability to effectively compete requires us to respond and adapt to new industry trends and developments, and implement new technology and innovations that may result in unexpected costs or may take longer than expected. To remain competitive, we must be willing and able to respond to market pressures timely. These pressures, and the implementation, timing, and results of our strategic pricing and other responses, could have a material effect on our sales and profitability. If we are unable to grow sales or reduce costs, among other actions, to wholly or partially offset the effect on profitability of our pricing actions, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Changing metals prices may have a significant impact on our liquidity, net sales, gross margins, operating income, and net income. The metals services industry as a whole is cyclical and, at times, pricing and availability of metal can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, general domestic and international economic conditions, labor costs, sales levels, competition, levels of inventory held by other metals service centers, consolidation of metals producers, higher raw material costs for the producers of metals, import duties and tariffs, and currency exchange rates. This volatility can significantly 12 affect the availability and cost of materials for us.  Our ability to pass on increases in costs in a timely manner depends on market conditions and may result in lower gross margins. In addition, higher prices could impact demand for our products, resulting in lower sales volumes. Moreover, we maintain substantial inventories of metal to accommodate the short lead times and just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers. Accordingly, we purchase metals in an effort to maintain inventory at levels that we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon historic buying practices, contracts with customers, and market conditions. Commitments for metal purchases are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time orders are placed or at the time of shipment. During periods of rising metal prices, we may be negatively impacted by delays between the time of increases in the cost of metals to us and increases in the prices that we charge for our products if we are unable to pass these increased costs on to our customers. In addition, when metal prices decline, this could result in lower selling prices for our products and, as we use existing inventory that we purchased at higher metal prices, lower gross profit margins. Declines in prices or reductions in sales volumes could adversely impact our ability to maintain our liquidity and to remain in compliance with certain financial covenants under our $1.3 billion revolving credit facility (“the Ryerson Credit Facility”), as well as result in us incurring inventory or goodwill impairment charges. Consequently, changing metals prices could significantly impact our liquidity, net sales, gross margins, operating income, and net income. Unexpected product shortages could negatively impact customer relationships, resulting in an adverse impact on results of operations. Disruptions could occur due to factors beyond our control, including economic downturns, political unrest, port slowdowns, trade issues, including increased export or import duties or trade restrictions, health crises, climate related disruptions, and other factors. Recent unrest in the Red Sea has increased both shipping times and costs presenting new challenges to the metals industry. Any of the aforementioned items could adversely affect a supplier’s ability to manufacture or deliver products to us.  Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in shipments of products or difficulties in obtaining products, any of which may expose us to unanticipated liability or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For our sources of lower cost products from Asia and other areas of the world, the effect of disruptions is typically increased due to the additional lead time required and distances involved. In addition, we have strategic relationships with a number of vendors. In the event we are unable to maintain those relations, there might be a loss of competitive pricing advantages which could, in turn, adversely affect results of operations.Changes in customer or product mix could cause our gross margin percentage to decline. From time to time, we experience changes in customer and product mix that affect gross margin. Changes in customer and product mix result primarily from business acquisitions, changes in customer demand, customer acquisitions, selling and marketing activities, and competition. If rapid growth with lower margin customers occurs, we will face pressure to maintain current gross margins, as these customers receive more discounted pricing due to their higher sales volume. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain historical gross margins in the future.We may not be able to retain or expand our customer base if the North American manufacturing industry erodes through acquisition and merger or consolidation activity in our customers’ industries. Our customer base primarily includes manufacturing and industrial firms. Some of our customers operate in industries that are undergoing consolidation through acquisition and merger activity and some customers have closed as they were unable to compete successfully with overseas competitors. Our facilities are predominately located in the U.S. and Canada. To the extent that our customers cease U.S. operations or relocate to regions in which we do not have a presence, we could lose their business. Acquirers of manufacturing and industrial firms may have suppliers of choice that do not include us, which could impact our customer base and market share. Global metal overcapacity and imports of metal products into the United States have adversely affected, and may again adversely affect, United States metal prices, which could impact our sales and results of operations.At times, global metal production capacity may exceed global consumption of metal products. Such excess capacity sometimes results in metal manufacturers in certain countries exporting steel at prices that are lower than prevailing domestic prices and sometimes at or below their cost of production. Excessive imports of metal into the U.S. have exerted and may exert in the future, downward pressure on U.S. steel prices which may negatively affect our results of operations.13 Lead time and the cost of our products could increase if we were to lose one of our primary suppliers. If, for any reason, our primary suppliers of aluminum, carbon steel, stainless steel, or other metals should curtail or discontinue their delivery of such metals in the quantities needed and at prices that are competitive, our business could suffer. The number of available suppliers could be reduced by factors such as industry consolidation and bankruptcies affecting steel and metal producers. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our top 25 suppliers represented approximately 78% of our purchases. We could be significantly and adversely affected if delivery were disrupted from a major supplier. If, in the future, we were unable to obtain sufficient amounts of the necessary metals at competitive prices and on a timely basis from our traditional suppliers, we may not be able to obtain such metals from alternative sources at competitive prices to meet our delivery schedules, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. RISKS RELATED TO MARKET AND ECONOMIC VOLATILITYChanges in inflation may adversely affect financial performance. Fluctuations in inflation could result in, and recent inflationary pressures have resulted in, lower revenues, higher costs, and decreased margins, profits, and earnings. Rapid or significant inflation could continue to increase the costs we incur to procure, process, package, and deliver our metal to customers and we may not be able to increase selling prices to customers at the same rate, resulting in decreased margins and operating profits. Prolonged periods of deflation could adversely affect the degree to which we are able to maintain or increase selling prices resulting in decreased revenues, margins, and operating profits. Additionally, prolonged deflation could impact our availability on the Ryerson Credit Facility as the value of our accounts receivable and inventory decreases. In addition, we rely on arrangements with third-party shipping and freight companies for the delivery of our products.  Freight and shipping costs may increase due to inflation, and any such increases could adversely affect our margins unless we are able to increase selling prices at the same rate.We monitor the risk that the principal markets in which we operate could continue to experience increased inflationary conditions. The onset, duration, and severity of an inflationary period cannot be estimated with precision.The volatility of the market could result in a material impairment of goodwill. We evaluate goodwill annually on October 1 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment. Events or changes in circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to our historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner or the use of our assets or the strategy for our overall business, and significant negative industry or economic trends. We test for impairment of goodwill by assessing various qualitative factors with respect to developments in our business and the overall economy and calculating the fair value of a reporting unit using a combination of an income approach based on discounted future cash flows and a market approach at the date of valuation, as necessary. Under the discounted cash flow method, the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated based on expected future economic benefits discounted to a present value at a rate of return commensurate with the risk associated with the investment. Projected cash flows are discounted to present value using an estimated weighted average cost of capital, which considers both returns to equity and debt investors. Please refer to the Section titled “Critical Accounting Estimates - Goodwill,” of Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations,” and Note 1 — “Summary of Accounting and Financial Policies” of Part II, Item 8 ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" for further information.Poor investment performance or other factors could require us to make significant unplanned contributions to our pension plan and future funding for postretirement employee benefits other than pensions also may require substantial payments from current cash flow. We provide defined benefit pension plans for certain eligible employees and retirees. The performance of the debt and equity markets affect the value of plan assets. A decline in the market value may increase the funding requirements for these plans. The cost of providing pension benefits is also affected by other factors, including interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels, the rate of return on plan assets, discount rates used in determining future benefit obligations, future government regulation, and prior contributions to the plans. Significant unanticipated changes in any of these factors may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 14 RISKS RELATED TO EXPANSION AND INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONSWe may not be able to successfully consummate and complete the integration of future acquisitions, and if we are unable to do so, it could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs and/or decreases in revenues and results of operations. We have grown through a combination of internal expansion, acquisitions, and joint ventures. We intend to continue to grow through acquisitions, but we may not be able to identify appropriate acquisition candidates, obtain financing on satisfactory terms, consummate acquisitions, or integrate acquired businesses effectively and profitably into our existing operations. Restrictions contained in the agreements governing the Ryerson Credit Facility, or our other existing or future debt may also inhibit our ability to make certain investments, including acquisitions, and participations in joint ventures. Acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures, and other business combination transactions, both foreign and domestic, involve various inherent risks, such as uncertainties in assessing value, strengths, weaknesses, liabilities, and potential profitability. There is also risk relating to our ability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from the transactions. Additionally, problems could arise from the integration of acquired businesses, including unanticipated changes in the business or industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition. Our future success will depend on our ability to complete the integration of these future acquisitions successfully into our operations. Specifically, after any acquisition, customers may choose to diversify their supply chains to reduce reliance on a single supplier for a portion of their metals needs. We may not be able to retain all of our and an acquisition’s customers, which may adversely affect our business and sales. Integrating acquisitions, particularly large acquisitions, requires us to enhance our operational and financial systems and employ additional qualified personnel, management, and financial resources, and may adversely affect our business by diverting management away from day-to-day operations. Further, failure to successfully integrate acquisitions may adversely affect our profitability by creating significant operating inefficiencies that could increase our operating expenses as a percentage of sales and reduce our operating income. In addition, we may not realize expected cost savings from acquisitions. Any one or more of these factors could cause us to not realize the benefits anticipated or have a negative impact on the fair value of the reporting units. Accordingly, goodwill and intangible assets recorded as a result of acquisitions could become impaired.Certain of our operations are located outside of the United States, which subjects us to risks associated with international activities. We have certain operations which are located outside of the U.S., in Canada, China, and Mexico. We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making corrupt payments or otherwise corruptly giving anything of value to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment, and requires companies to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices. The FCPA applies to covered companies, individual directors, officers, employees, and agents. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for some actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives. If we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA, governmental authorities in the U.S. could seek to impose civil and/or criminal penalties. Our international operations and potential joint ventures may cause us to incur costs and risks that may distract management from effectively operating our North American business, and such operations or joint ventures may not be profitable. We maintain foreign operations in Canada, China, and Mexico. International operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business in, and with, foreign countries, including price controls, exchange controls, export controls, economic sanctions, duties, tariffs, limitations on participation in local enterprises, nationalization, expropriation and other governmental action, and changes in currency exchange rates. While we believe that our current arrangements with local partners provide us with experienced business partners in foreign countries, events or issues, including disagreements with our partners, may occur that require attention of our senior executives and may result in expenses or losses that erode the profitability of our foreign operations or cause our capital investments abroad to be unprofitable. We may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations in the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar, the Chinese renminbi, the Hong Kong dollar, and the Mexican peso.We have significant operations in Canada which incur the majority of their metal supply costs in U.S. dollars but earn the majority of their sales in Canadian dollars. Additionally, we have significant assets in China and conduct operations in Mexico. We may from time to time experience losses when the value of the U.S. dollar strengthens against the Canadian dollar, the Chinese renminbi, the Hong Kong dollar, or the Mexican peso, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, we are subject to translation risk when we consolidate our Canadian, Chinese, and Mexican subsidiaries’ net assets into our balance sheet. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, the Hong Kong dollar, or the Mexican peso could reduce the value of these assets as reported in our financial statements, which could, as a result, reduce our stockholders’ equity.15 The Chinese government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities, particularly with regards to the land our facilities are located on. The Chinese government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property, and other matters. We believe that our operations in China are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations. Moreover, the Chinese court system does not provide the same property and contract right guarantees as do courts in the U.S. and, accordingly, disputes may be protracted and resolution of claims may result in significant economic loss. Additionally, there is no private ownership of land in China and all land ownership is held by the government of China, its agencies, and collectives, which issue land use rights that are generally renewable. We lease the land where our Chinese facilities are located from the Chinese government. If the Chinese government decided to terminate our land use rights agreements, our assets could become impaired and our ability to meet customer orders could be impacted. RISKS RELATED TO CYBERSECURITY AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGYDamage to our information technology infrastructure could harm our business. The unavailability of any of our computer-based systems for any significant period of time could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In particular, our ability to manage inventory levels successfully largely depends on the efficient operation of our computer hardware and software systems. We use management information systems to track inventory information at individual facilities, provide pricing recommendations for sales quotes, communicate customer information, and aggregate daily sales, margin, and promotional information. Difficulties associated with upgrades, installations of major software or hardware, and integration with new systems could have a material adverse effect on results of operations. We could be required to expend substantial resources to upgrade our information systems or integrate them with the systems of companies we have acquired. The upgrade or integration of these systems may disrupt our business or lead to operating inefficiencies. In addition, these systems are vulnerable to, among other things, damage or interruption from fire, flood, tornado, and other natural disasters, power loss, computer system and network failures, operator negligence, physical and electronic loss of data, or security breaches and computer viruses. We are subject to cybersecurity risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks.We depend on the proper functioning and availability of our information technology platform, including communications and data processing systems, in operating our business. These systems include software programs that are integral to the efficient operation of our business. We have established security measures, controls, and procedures, including established recovery procedures for critical systems and business functions, to safeguard our information technology systems and to prevent unauthorized access to such systems and any data processed or stored in such systems, and we periodically evaluate and test the adequacy of such systems, measures, controls, and procedures; however, there can be no guarantee that such systems, measures, controls, and procedures will be effective. Security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of our information, litigation, and potential liability. In addition, cyber incidents that impact the availability, reliability, speed, accuracy, or other proper functioning of these systems could have a significant impact on our operations, and potentially on our results.  We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyberattacks. A significant cyber incident, including system failure, security breach, disruption by malware, or other damage could interrupt or delay our operations, result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, damage our reputation, cause a loss of customers, or give rise to monetary fines and other penalties, which could be significant. Refer to Item 1C: ""Cybersecurity"" for further information on our Cybersecurity processes, policies, and programs.RISKS RELATED TO OPERATING OUR BUSINESSAny significant work stoppages can harm our business. As of December 31, 2023, we employed approximately 4,300 persons in North America and 300 persons in China. Our North American workforce was comprised of approximately 1,900 office employees and approximately 2,400 plant employees. Sixteen percent of our plant employees were members of various unions, including the United Steel Workers and The International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Eight renewal contracts covering 160 employees were successfully negotiated in 2023. Eight contracts covering 152 employees are currently scheduled to expire in 2024.16 Certain employee retirement benefit plans are underfunded and the actual cost of those benefits could exceed current estimates, which would require us to fund the shortfall. As of December 31, 2023, our pension plan had an unfunded liability of $63.9 million and our other postretirement benefits plan had an unfunded liability of $35.7 million. Our actual costs for benefits required to be paid may exceed those projected and future actuarial assessments. Under those circumstances, the adjustments required to be made to our recorded liability for these benefits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and cash payments to fund these plans could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows. We may be required to make substantial future contributions to improve the plan’s funded status. Any prolonged disruption of our processing centers could harm our business. We have dedicated processing centers that permit us to produce standardized products in large volumes while maintaining low operating costs. We may suffer prolonged disruption in the operations of any of these facilities, whether due to labor or technical difficulties, destruction, or damage sustained as a result of natural disasters or climate-related events to any of the facilities or otherwise, which could adversely affect our operating results. If we are unable to retain, attract, and motivate management and key personnel, it may adversely affect our business. In order to compete and have continued growth, we must attract, retain, and motivate executives and other key employees, including those in managerial, technical, sales, marketing, and support positions. We believe that our success is due, in part, to our experienced management team. Losing the services of one or more members of our management team such as our CEO, Edward J. Lehner, could adversely affect our business and possibly prevent us from improving our operational, financial, and information management systems and controls. We compete to hire employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies. In the future, we may need to retain and hire additional qualified sales, marketing, administrative, operating, and technical personnel, and to train and manage new personnel. Our ability to implement our business plan is dependent on our ability to retain, hire, and train a large number of qualified employees each year. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover, or increased employee benefit costs.Our risk management strategies may result in losses. From time to time, we may use fixed-price and/or fixed-volume supplier contracts to offset contracts with customers. Some of our existing supply agreements have required minimum purchase quantities. Under adverse economic conditions, those minimums may exceed our needs. Absent exceptions for force majeure and other circumstances affecting the legal enforceability of the agreements, these minimum purchase requirements may compel us to purchase quantities of raw materials that could significantly exceed our anticipated needs or pay damages to the supplier for shortfalls. In these circumstances, we would attempt to negotiate agreements for new purchase quantities. There is a risk, however, that we would not be successful in reducing purchase quantities, either through negotiation or litigation. If that occurred, we would likely be required to purchase more of a particular raw material in a particular year than we need, negatively affecting our results of operations and cash flows.Additionally, we may use commodity contracts, foreign exchange contracts, and interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk, and interest rate risk. These risk management strategies pose certain risks, including the risk that losses on a hedge position may exceed the amount invested in such instruments. Moreover, a party in a hedging transaction may be unavailable or unwilling to settle our obligations, which could cause us to suffer corresponding losses. A hedging instrument may not be effective in eliminating all of the risks inherent in any particular position. Our profitability may be adversely affected during any period as a result of the use of such instruments.RISKS RELATED TO REGULATORY AND LEGAL MATTERSWe could incur substantial costs related to environmental, health, and safety laws. Our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental, health, and safety laws. These include laws that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and establish standards for the treatment, storage, and disposal of regulated materials, and the investigation and remediation of contaminated soil, surface water, and groundwater. Failure to maintain or achieve compliance with these laws or with the permits required for our operations could result in substantial increases in operating costs and capital expenditures. In addition, we may be subject to fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third party claims for property damage or personal injury, worker’s compensation or personal injury claims, cleanup costs, or temporary or permanent discontinuance of operations. Certain of our facilities are located in industrial areas, have a history of heavy industrial use, and have been in operation for many years and, over time, we and other predecessor operators of these facilities have generated, used, handled, and disposed of 17 hazardous and other regulated wastes. Environmental liabilities could exist, including cleanup obligations at these facilities or at off-site locations where materials from our operations were disposed of, which could result in future expenditures that cannot be currently quantified and which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Such liabilities may be imposed without regard to fault or the legality of a party’s conduct and may, in certain circumstances, be joint and several. Future changes to environmental, health, and safety laws, including those related to climate change, could result in material liabilities and costs, constrain operations, or make such operations more costly for us, our suppliers, and our customers. In October 2011, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) named JT Ryerson as one of more than 100 businesses that may be a potentially responsible party for the Portland Harbor Superfund Site. See Note 12: Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report on Form 10-K. As the EPA has not yet allocated responsibility for the contamination among the potentially responsible parties, including JT Ryerson, we do not currently have sufficient information available to us to determine whether the Record of Decision will be executed as currently stated, whether and to what extent JT Ryerson may be held responsible for any of the identified contamination, and how much (if any) of the final plan’s costs might ultimately be allocated to JT Ryerson. Therefore, management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or estimate a range of potential loss at this time.Environmental, social, and governance matters, and any related reporting obligation may impact our businessOur business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations and expectations, including with respect to environmental, social, and governance matters (""ESG""), that could expose us to numerous risks. These rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity, and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by Congress, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. In addition, increasingly regulators, customers, investors, employees, and other stakeholders are focusing on ESG type matters and related disclosures. Our implementation of these evolving rules and regulations will require additional resources and implementation of new practices and reporting processes, all entailing additional compliance risk. Moreover, the progress and disclosure of our initiatives within the ESG scope could be criticized for accuracy, adequacy, and completeness, or may not advance at a sufficient pace. If our ESG-related data, processes, and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, or if we fail to achieve progress with respect to our sustainability goals, or at all, our reputation, business, financial performance, and growth could be adversely affected.Overall increased emphasis of ESG in itself and ESG reporting has increased stakeholder focus, including by U.S. and foreign governmental authorities, investors, and customers on environmental sustainability matters, such as climate change, the reduction of greenhouse gases, and water consumption. Legislative, regulatory, or other efforts to combat climate change or other environmental concerns could result in future increases in taxes, restrictions on or increases in the costs of supplies, transportation, and utilities, any of which could increase our operating costs, and necessitate future investments in facilities and equipment. Further, the customers we serve may impose emissions reduction or other environmental standards and requirements. As a result, we may experience increased compliance burdens and costs and the sourcing of our products may be adversely affected. These risks also include the increased pressure to make commitments, set targets, or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them, which could expose us to market, operational, execution, and reputation costs or risks. Regulations related to conflict-free minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and place us at a competitive disadvantage. On August 22, 2012, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), the SEC adopted new requirements for reporting companies that use certain minerals and metals, known as “conflict minerals”, in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. These requirements require companies to diligence, disclose, and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to conclusively verify the origins for all metals used in our products and we may face reputational challenges with our customers. Additionally, as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering “conflict free” metals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary metals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Accordingly, we could incur significant costs related to the compliance process, including potential difficulty or added costs in satisfying the disclosure requirements. Moreover, we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.Tax changes could affect our effective tax rate, the value of our deferred tax assets, and future profitability.Our future results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate or changes in the treatment of deferred tax assets as a result of changes in Ryerson’s overall profitability, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax legislation, the results of the examination of previously filed tax returns, and continuing assessment of the Company’s tax exposures. In particular, although the passage of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 reduced the U.S. tax rate to 21%, our future earnings could be negatively impacted by changes in tax legislation including changing tax rates and tax base such as 18 limiting, phasing-out, or eliminating deductions or tax credits, changing rules for earnings repatriations, and changing other tax laws in the U.S. or other countries. We are subject to litigation that could strain our resources and distract management. From time to time, we are involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, and other disputes arising in the ordinary course of business. These suits concern issues including product liability, contract disputes, employee-related matters, and personal injury matters. It is not feasible to predict the outcome of all pending suits and claims, and the ultimate resolution of these matters as well as future lawsuits that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or reputation. We may face product liability claims that are costly and create adverse publicity. If any of the products that we sell cause harm to any of our customers, we could be exposed to product liability lawsuits. If we were found liable under product liability claims, we could be required to pay substantial monetary damages. Further, even if we successfully defended ourselves against this type of claim, we could be forced to spend a substantial amount of money in litigation expenses, our management could be required to spend valuable time in the defense against these claims, and our reputation could suffer.  RISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCKOur stock price has fluctuated in the past, has recently been volatile, and may be volatile in the future, and as a result, investors in our common stock could incur substantial losses.We may incur rapid and substantial decreases in our stock price in the foreseeable future that are unrelated to our operating performance or prospects.As a result of this volatility, investors may experience losses on their investment in our common stock. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including the following:• investor reaction to our business strategy;•the success of competitive products or technologies;•any developments with respect to our pursuit of strategic alternatives, including a potential sale or merger of the Company, sale of part of the Company, strategic minority investment, or licensing and other transactions;•changes in regulatory or industry standards applicable to our products;•variations in our financial and operating results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;•developments concerning our collaborations or partners;•developments or disputes with any third parties that supply, manufacture, sell, or market any of our products;•actual or perceived defects in any of our products, if commercialized, and any related product liability claims;•our ability or inability to raise additional capital and the terms on which we raise it;•declines in the market prices of stocks generally;•trading volume of our common stock;•sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders;•general economic, industry, and market conditions; and•other events or factors, including those resulting from such events, or the prospect of such events, including war, terrorism, and other international conflicts, public health issues including health epidemics or pandemics, and natural disasters such as fire, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, or other adverse weather and climate conditions, whether occurring in the U.S. or elsewhere, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of our suppliers, or result in political or economic instability.In the past, following periods of volatility in the market, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management's attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects. 19 There can be no guarantee that our stock price will remain at current levels or that future sales of our common stock will not be at prices lower than those sold to investors.We paid cash dividends on our common stock in each quarter of 2023, but any future dividend payments are at the discretion of our Board of Directors.Since the third quarter of 2021 we have paid regular quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. Any declaration and payment of cash dividends on our common stock in the future, whether at current levels or at all, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, future prospects, contractual restrictions, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Therefore, you should not rely on dividend income from shares of our common stock. For more information, see ""Dividend Policy"" of Part II, Item 5 ""Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities"". Your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in us may be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and you sell your shares at a profit, but there is no guarantee that the market price for our common stock will ever exceed the price that you pay for our common stock.Our corporate documents and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of the Company.Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our Board of Directors. These provisions:•establish a classified Board of Directors so that not all members of our Board of Directors are elected at one time;•authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;•provide that the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our amended and restated bylaws;•prohibit stockholders from acting by written consent if less than a majority of the voting power of our outstanding stock is controlled by Platinum; and•establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing.Any issuance of preferred stock could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our common stock, which could depress the price of our common stock.Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue preferred stock and to determine the preferences, limitations, and relative rights of shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Our preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend, and other rights superior to the rights of our common stock. The potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of us, discouraging bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price, and adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.RISKS RELATED TO OUR CAPITAL STRUCTUREWe have indebtedness under our Ryerson Credit Facility, which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations. As of December 31, 2023, our total indebtedness under the Ryerson Credit Facility was $433 million and we had $560 million of unused capacity on the facility. Our indebtedness may: •make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our indebtedness; •limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes; 20 •limit our ability to use our cash flow for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes; •require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments; •limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry; •place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and •increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of the Ryerson Credit Facility restrict but do not prohibit us from doing so, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify. The covenants in the Ryerson Credit Facility and covenants contained in agreements governing indebtedness that we incur in the future may impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility. The Ryerson Credit Facility contains a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries, including JT Ryerson, to: •incur additional debt; •make certain investments or other restricted payments; •create liens or use assets as security in other transactions; •merge, consolidate, transfer, or dispose of substantially all of our assets; and •engage in transactions with affiliates. The terms of the Ryerson Credit Facility require that, in the event availability under the facility declines to a certain level, we maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter. Total credit availability is limited by the amount of eligible accounts receivable, inventory, and qualified cash pledged as collateral under the agreement insofar as the Company is subject to a borrowing base comprised of the aggregate of these three amounts, less applicable reserves. As of December 31, 2023, total credit availability under the Ryerson Credit Facility was $560 million. See discussion regarding the Ryerson Credit Facility in Note 9: “Debt” of Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” as well as the discussion within the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”Our future indebtedness may contain covenants more restrictive in certain respects than the restrictions contained in the Ryerson Credit Facility. Operating results below current levels or other adverse factors, including a significant increase in interest rates, could result in our being unable to comply with financial covenants that are contained in the Ryerson Credit Facility or that may be contained in any future indebtedness. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to our stockholders and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. Balances outstanding on the Ryerson Credit Facility and our other outstanding indebtedness are expected to account for significant cash interest expenses. Accordingly, we will have to generate significant cash flows from operations to meet our debt service requirements. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service and working capital requirements, we may be required to sell assets, seek additional capital, reduce capital expenditures, restructure or refinance all or a portion of our existing indebtedness, or seek additional financing. Moreover, insufficient cash flow may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Because the majority of our indebtedness bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain prevailing short-term interest rates, we are vulnerable to interest rate increases. The majority of our indebtedness, including the Ryerson Credit Facility, bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain short-term prevailing interest rates. As of December 31, 2023, we had $433.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Ryerson Credit Facility, with an additional $560 million available for borrowing under such facility. Assuming a consistent level of 21 debt through-out 2023 a 100 basis point increase in the interest rate on our floating rate debt effective from the beginning of the year would increase our interest expense under the Ryerson Credit Facility and the China credit facility by approximately $4.7 million, on an annual basis. The Federal Reserve has continued to increase interest rates in 2023, increasing our interest expense on the Ryerson Credit Facility. If interest rates continue to rise in the future, we could be unable to service our debt, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Changes in our credit ratings and outlook may reduce access to capital and increase borrowing costs.Our credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and factors outside of our control, such as conditions affecting our industry generally or the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies. We cannot provide assurances that our current credit ratings will remain in effect or that the ratings will not be lowered, suspended, or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies. If rating agencies lower, suspend, or withdraw the ratings, the market price or marketability of our securities may be adversely affected. In addition, any negative change in ratings could make it more difficult for us to raise capital on acceptable terms, impact the ability to obtain adequate financing, and result in higher interest costs for our existing credit facilities, including the Ryerson Credit Facility, or on future financings.RISKS RELATED TO OUR STOCKHOLDER BASEPlatinum owns a substantial percentage of our stock and has the right to nominate two members of the Corporation’s board and will be able to exert influence over matters subject to stockholder approval.Platinum owns approximately 3,924,478 shares of our common stock, which is approximately 11.5% of our issued and outstanding common stock. Therefore, Platinum may be able to influence all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, Platinum may be able to influence elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that our stockholders may believe are in their best interest as stockholders. The Company is party to an investor rights agreement (the “Investor Rights Agreement”) with certain affiliates of Platinum which provides, among other things, that for so long as Platinum collectively beneficially owns (i) at least 30% of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the Company, Platinum will have the right to nominate for election to the board of directors of the Company no fewer than that number of directors that would constitute a majority of the number of directors if there were no vacancies on the board, (ii) at least 15% but less than 30% of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the Company, Platinum will have the right to nominate two directors, and (iii) at least 5% but less than 15% of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the Company, Platinum will have the right to nominate one director. The agreement also provides that if the size of the board of directors is increased or decreased at any time, Platinum’s nomination rights will be proportionately increased or decreased, respectively, rounded up to the nearest whole number. Based on Platinum's current voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the Company and the current size of the Board, Platinum has the right to nominate up to two directors pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement. As a result, Platinum may influence our policies and operations, including the appointment of management, future issuances of our common stock or other securities, and the payment of dividends, as well as impact decisions to enter into any other corporate transaction. The interests of Platinum may not in all cases be aligned with the interests of the other holders of our common stock. For example, a sale of a substantial number of shares of stock in the future by Platinum could cause our stock price to decline. Further, Platinum could cause us to make acquisitions that increase the amount of the indebtedness that is secured or senior to the Company’s existing debt or sell revenue-generating assets, impairing our ability to make payments under such debt. Additionally, Platinum is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Accordingly, Platinum may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, Platinum may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to holders of our common stock"
3,RYI,RYERSON HOLDING CORP,2023-02-22,"ITEM 1A.	RISK FACTORS. Our business faces many risks. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the other information in this report, including the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors below will not occur. These risks could have a material and adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRYWeakness in the economy, market trends, and other conditions affecting the profitability and financial stability of our customers could negatively impact our sales growth and results of operations. Economic and industry trends affect our business environments. We serve several metals-consuming industries in which the demand for our products and services is sensitive to the production activity, capital spending, and demand for products and services of our customers. Many of these customers operate in markets that are subject to highly cyclical fluctuations resulting from seasonality, market uncertainty, costs of goods sold, currency exchange rates, foreign competition, offshoring of production, oil and natural gas prices, geopolitical developments, and a variety of other factors beyond our control. Any of these factors could cause customers to idle or close facilities, delay purchases, reduce production levels, or experience reductions in the demand for their own products or services.Any of these events could impair the ability of our customers to make full and timely payments or reduce the volume of products and services these customers purchase from us and could cause increased pressure on our selling prices and terms of sale. We do not expect the cyclical nature of our industry to change and any downturn in our customers’ industries could reduce our revenues and profitability or a significant or prolonged slowdown in activity in the U.S., Canada, or any other major world economy, or a segment of any such economy, could negatively impact our sales growth and results of operations.The metals services business is very competitive and increased competition could reduce our revenues and gross margins. We face competition in all markets we serve, from metals producers that sell directly to certain customers or segments of the market, to other metal services companies. The metals services industry itself is highly fragmented and competitive. There are a few large competitors, but most of the market is served by small local and regional competitors. Competition is based principally on price, service, quality, production capabilities, inventory availability, and timely delivery. We are experiencing increased pressure from online businesses that compete with price transparency. We expect technological advancements and the increased use of e-commerce solutions within the industry to continue to evolve at a rapid pace. As a result, our ability to effectively compete requires us to respond and adapt to new industry trends and developments, and implement new technology and innovations that may result in unexpected costs or may take longer than expected. To remain competitive, we must be willing and able to respond to market pressures. These pressures, and the implementation, timing, and results of our strategic pricing and other responses, could have a material effect on our sales and profitability. If we are unable to grow sales or reduce costs, among other actions, to wholly or partially offset the effect on profitability of our pricing actions, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Changing metals prices may have a significant impact on our liquidity, net sales, gross margins, operating income, and net income. The metals services industry as a whole is cyclical and, at times, pricing and availability of metal can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control, including general domestic and international economic conditions, labor costs, sales levels, competition, levels of inventory held by other metals service centers, consolidation of metals producers, higher raw material costs for the producers of metals, import duties and tariffs, and currency exchange rates. This volatility can significantly affect the availability and cost of materials for us.  Our ability to pass on increases in costs in a timely manner depends on market conditions and may result in lower gross margins. In addition, higher prices could impact demand for these products, resulting in lower sales volumes. Moreover, we maintain substantial inventories of metal to accommodate the short lead times and just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers. Accordingly, we purchase metals in an effort to maintain inventory at levels that we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon historic buying practices, contracts with customers, and market conditions. Commitments for metal purchases are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time orders are placed or at the time of shipment. During periods of rising metal prices, we may be negatively impacted by delays between the time of increases in the cost of 13 metals to us and increases in the prices that we charge for our products if we are unable to pass these increased costs on to our customers. In addition, when metal prices decline, this could result in lower selling prices for our products and, as we use existing inventory that we purchased at higher metal prices, lower gross profit margins. Declines in prices or reductions in sales volumes could adversely impact our ability to maintain our liquidity and to remain in compliance with certain financial covenants under our $1.3 billion revolving credit facility (“the Ryerson Credit Facility”), as well as result in us incurring inventory or goodwill impairment charges. Consequently, changing metals prices could significantly impact our liquidity, net sales, gross margins, operating income, and net income. Unexpected product shortages could negatively impact customer relationships, resulting in an adverse impact on results of operations. Disruptions could occur due to factors beyond our control, including economic downturns, political unrest, port slowdowns, trade issues, including increased export or import duties or trade restrictions, health crises, climate related disruptions, and other factors, any of which could adversely affect a supplier’s ability to manufacture or deliver products to us. Public health problems may result in quarantines, business closures, transportation restrictions, import and export complications, and otherwise cause shortages in the supply of materials, higher costs for available supplies, or cause other disruptions within our operations and supply chain. Public health problems may cause increased costs of certain supplies and disruptions and delays within our supply chain, and may expose us to unanticipated liability or require us to change our business practices. Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in shipments of products or difficulties in obtaining products, any of which may expose us to unanticipated liability or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For our sources of lower cost products from Asia and other areas of the world, the effect of disruptions is typically increased due to the additional lead time required and distances involved.  Further, the risk of disruption is increased due to the current political climate seeking trade reform. In addition, we have strategic relationships with a number of vendors. In the event we are unable to maintain those relations, there might be a loss of competitive pricing advantages which could, in turn, adversely affect results of operations.Changes in customer or product mix could cause our gross margin percentage to decline. From time to time, we experience changes in customer and product mix that affect gross margin. Changes in customer and product mix result primarily from business acquisitions, changes in customer demand, customer acquisitions, selling and marketing activities, and competition. If rapid growth with lower margin customers occurs, we will face pressure to maintain current gross margins, as these customers receive more discounted pricing due to their higher sales volume. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain historical gross margins in the future.We may not be able to retain or expand our customer base if the North American manufacturing industry erodes through acquisition and merger or consolidation activity in our customers’ industries. Our customer base primarily includes manufacturing and industrial firms. Some of our customers operate in industries that are undergoing consolidation through acquisition and merger activity and some customers have closed as they were unable to compete successfully with overseas competitors. Our facilities are predominately located in the U.S. and Canada. To the extent that our customers cease U.S. operations or relocate to regions in which we do not have a presence, we could lose their business. Acquirers of manufacturing and industrial firms may have suppliers of choice that do not include us, which could impact our customer base and market share. Global metal overcapacity and imports of metal products into the United States have adversely affected, and may again adversely affect, United States metal prices, which could impact our sales and results of operations.At times, global metal production capacity may exceed global consumption of metal products. Such excess capacity sometimes results in metal manufacturers in certain countries exporting steel at prices that are lower than prevailing domestic prices and sometimes at or below their cost of production. Excessive imports of metal into the U.S. have exerted and may exert in the future, downward pressure on U.S. steel prices which may negatively affect our results of operations.Lead time and the cost of our products could increase if we were to lose one of our primary suppliers. If, for any reason, our primary suppliers of aluminum, carbon steel, stainless steel, or other metals should curtail or discontinue their delivery of such metals in the quantities needed and at prices that are competitive, our business could suffer. The number of available suppliers could be reduced by factors such as industry consolidation and bankruptcies affecting steel and metal producers. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our top 25 suppliers represented approximately 78% of our purchases. We could be 14 significantly and adversely affected if delivery were disrupted from a major supplier. If, in the future, we were unable to obtain sufficient amounts of the necessary metals at competitive prices and on a timely basis from our traditional suppliers, we may not be able to obtain such metals from alternative sources at competitive prices to meet our delivery schedules, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. RISKS RELATED TO MARKET AND ECONOMIC VOLATILITYChanges in inflation may adversely affect financial performance. Fluctuations in inflation could result in, and recent inflationary pressures have resulted in, lower revenues, higher costs, and decreased margins, profits, and earnings. Rapid or significant inflation could continue to increase the costs we incur to procure, process, package, and deliver our metal to customers and we may not be able to increase selling prices to customers at the same rate, resulting in decreased margins and operating profits. Prolonged periods of deflation could adversely affect the degree to which we are able to maintain or increase selling prices resulting in decreased revenues, margins, and operating profits. Additionally, prolonged deflation could impact our availability on the Ryerson Credit Facility as the value of our accounts receivable and inventory decreases. In addition, we rely on arrangements with third-party shipping and freight companies for the delivery of our products.  Freight and shipping costs may increase due to inflation, and any such increases could adversely affect our margins unless we are able to increase selling prices at the same rate.We monitor the risk that the principal markets in which we operate could continue to experience increased inflationary conditions. The onset, duration, and severity of an inflationary period cannot be estimated with precision.The volatility of the market could result in a material impairment of goodwill. We evaluate goodwill annually on October 1 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment. Events or changes in circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to our historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner or the use of our assets or the strategy for our overall business, and significant negative industry or economic trends. We test for impairment of goodwill by assessing various qualitative factors with respect to developments in our business and the overall economy and calculating the fair value of a reporting unit using a combination of an income approach based on discounted future cash flows and a market approach at the date of valuation, as necessary. Under the discounted cash flow method, the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated based on expected future economic benefits discounted to a present value at a rate of return commensurate with the risk associated with the investment. Projected cash flows are discounted to present value using an estimated weighted average cost of capital, which considers both returns to equity and debt investors. Please refer to the Section titled “Critical Accounting Estimates - Goodwill,” of Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations,” and Note 1 — “Summary of Accounting and Financial Policies” of Part II, Item 8 ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" for further information.Poor investment performance or other factors could require us to make significant unplanned contributions to our pension plan and future funding for postretirement employee benefits other than pensions also may require substantial payments from current cash flow. We provide defined benefit pension plans for certain eligible employees and retirees. The performance of the debt and equity markets affect the value of plan assets. A decline in the market value may increase the funding requirements for these plans. The cost of providing pension benefits is also affected by other factors, including interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels, the rate of return on plan assets, discount rates used in determining future benefit obligations, future government regulation, and prior contributions to the plans. Significant unanticipated changes in any of these factors may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. RISKS RELATED TO EXPANSION AND INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONSWe may not be able to successfully consummate and complete the integration of future acquisitions, and if we are unable to do so, it could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs and/or decreases in revenues and results of operations. We have grown through a combination of internal expansion, acquisitions, and joint ventures. We intend to continue to grow through selective acquisitions, but we may not be able to identify appropriate acquisition candidates, obtain financing on satisfactory terms, consummate acquisitions, or integrate acquired businesses effectively and profitably into our existing operations. Restrictions contained in the agreements governing the Ryerson Credit Facility, or our other existing or future debt may also inhibit our ability to make certain investments, including acquisitions, and participations in joint ventures. 15 Acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures, and other business combination transactions, both foreign and domestic, involve various inherent risks, such as uncertainties in assessing value, strengths, weaknesses, liabilities, and potential profitability. There is also risk relating to our ability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from the transactions. Additionally, problems could arise from the integration of acquired businesses, including unanticipated changes in the business or industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition. Our future success will depend on our ability to complete the integration of these future acquisitions successfully into our operations. Specifically, after any acquisition, customers may choose to diversify their supply chains to reduce reliance on a single supplier for a portion of their metals needs. We may not be able to retain all of our and an acquisition’s customers, which may adversely affect our business and sales. Integrating acquisitions, particularly large acquisitions, requires us to enhance our operational and financial systems and employ additional qualified personnel, management, and financial resources, and may adversely affect our business by diverting management away from day-to-day operations. Further, failure to successfully integrate acquisitions may adversely affect our profitability by creating significant operating inefficiencies that could increase our operating expenses as a percentage of sales and reduce our operating income. In addition, we may not realize expected cost savings from acquisitions. Any one or more of these factors could cause us to not realize the benefits anticipated or have a negative impact on the fair value of the reporting units. Accordingly, goodwill and intangible assets recorded as a result of acquisitions could become impaired.Certain of our operations are located outside of the United States, which subjects us to risks associated with international activities. Certain of our operations are located outside of the U.S., primarily in Canada, China, and Mexico. We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making corrupt payments or otherwise corruptly giving anything of value to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment, and requires companies to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices. The FCPA applies to covered companies, individual directors, officers, employees, and agents. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for some actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives. If we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA, governmental authorities in the U.S. could seek to impose civil and/or criminal penalties. Our international operations and potential joint ventures may cause us to incur costs and risks that may distract management from effectively operating our North American business, and such operations or joint ventures may not be profitable. We maintain foreign operations in Canada, China, and Mexico. International operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business in, and with, foreign countries, including price controls, exchange controls, export controls, economic sanctions, duties, tariffs, limitations on participation in local enterprises, nationalization, expropriation and other governmental action, and changes in currency exchange rates. In addition, we may be subject to business disruptions created by health crises and outbreaks of communicable diseases. While we believe that our current arrangements with local partners provide us with experienced business partners in foreign countries, events or issues, including disagreements with our partners, may occur that require attention of our senior executives and may result in expenses or losses that erode the profitability of our foreign operations or cause our capital investments abroad to be unprofitable. We may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations in the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar, the Chinese renminbi, the Hong Kong dollar, and the Mexican peso.We have significant operations in Canada which incur the majority of their metal supply costs in U.S. dollars but earn the majority of their sales in Canadian dollars. Additionally, we have significant assets in China. We also conduct business in Mexico. We may from time to time experience losses when the value of the U.S. dollar strengthens against the Canadian dollar, the Chinese renminbi, the Hong Kong dollar, or the Mexican peso, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, we are subject to translation risk when we consolidate our Canadian, Chinese, and Mexican subsidiaries’ net assets into our balance sheet. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, the Hong Kong dollar, or the Mexican peso could reduce the value of these assets as reported in our financial statements, which could, as a result, reduce our stockholders’ equity.The Chinese government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities, particularly with regards to the land our facilities are located on. The Chinese government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property, and other matters. We believe that our operations in China are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations. 16 Moreover, the Chinese court system does not provide the same property and contract right guarantees as do courts in the U.S. and, accordingly, disputes may be protracted and resolution of claims may result in significant economic loss. Additionally, there is no private ownership of land in China and all land ownership is held by the government of China, its agencies, and collectives, which issue land use rights that are generally renewable. We lease the land where our Chinese facilities are located from the Chinese government. If the Chinese government decided to terminate our land use rights agreements, our assets could become impaired and our ability to meet customer orders could be impacted. RISKS RELATED TO CYBERSECURITYDamage to our information technology infrastructure could harm our business. The unavailability of any of our computer-based systems for any significant period of time could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In particular, our ability to manage inventory levels successfully largely depends on the efficient operation of our computer hardware and software systems. We use management information systems to track inventory information at individual facilities, communicate customer information, and aggregate daily sales, margin, and promotional information. Difficulties associated with upgrades, installations of major software or hardware, and integration with new systems could have a material adverse effect on results of operations. We could be required to expend substantial resources to upgrade our information systems or integrate them with the systems of companies we have acquired. The upgrade or integration of these systems may disrupt our business or lead to operating inefficiencies. In addition, these systems are vulnerable to, among other things, damage or interruption from fire, flood, tornado, and other natural disasters, power loss, computer system and network failures, operator negligence, physical and electronic loss of data, or security breaches and computer viruses. We are subject to cybersecurity risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks.We depend on the proper functioning and availability of our information technology platform, including communications and data processing systems, in operating our business. These systems include software programs that are integral to the efficient operation of our business. We have established security measures, controls, and procedures, including established recovery procedures for critical systems and business functions, to safeguard our information technology systems and to prevent unauthorized access to such systems and any data processed or stored in such systems, and we periodically evaluate and test the adequacy of such systems, measures, controls, and procedures; however, there can be no guarantee that such systems, measures, controls, and procedures will be effective. Security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of our information, litigation, and potential liability. In addition, cyber incidents that impact the availability, reliability, speed, accuracy, or other proper functioning of these systems could have a significant impact on our operations, and potentially on our results.  We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyberattacks. A significant cyber incident, including system failure, security breach, disruption by malware, or other damage could interrupt or delay our operations, result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, damage our reputation, cause a loss of customers, or give rise to monetary fines and other penalties, which could be significant.RISKS RELATED TO OPERATING OUR BUSINESSAny significant work stoppages can harm our business. As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 3,900 persons in North America and 300 persons in China. Our North American workforce was comprised of approximately 1,800 office employees and approximately 2,100 plant employees. Sixteen percent of our plant employees were members of various unions, including the United Steel Workers and The International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Four renewal contracts covering 98 employees were successfully negotiated in 2022. Six contracts covering 120 employees are currently scheduled to expire in 2023.Certain employee retirement benefit plans are underfunded and the actual cost of those benefits could exceed current estimates, which would require us to fund the shortfall. As of December 31, 2022, our pension plan had an unfunded liability of $73.0 million. Our actual costs for benefits required to be paid may exceed those projected and future actuarial assessments. Under those circumstances, the adjustments required to be made to our recorded liability for these benefits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and cash payments to fund these plans could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows. We may be required to make substantial future contributions to improve the plan’s funded status. 17 Any prolonged disruption of our processing centers could harm our business. We have dedicated processing centers that permit us to produce standardized products in large volumes while maintaining low operating costs. We may suffer prolonged disruption in the operations of any of these facilities, whether due to labor or technical difficulties, destruction, or damage to any of the facilities or otherwise, which could adversely affect our operating results. If we are unable to retain, attract, and motivate management and key personnel, it may adversely affect our business. In order to compete and have continued growth, we must attract, retain, and motivate executives and other key employees, including those in managerial, technical, sales, marketing, and support positions. We believe that our success is due, in part, to our experienced management team. Losing the services of one or more members of our management team such as our CEO, Edward J. Lehner, could adversely affect our business and possibly prevent us from improving our operational, financial, and information management systems and controls. We compete to hire employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies. In the future, we may need to retain and hire additional qualified sales, marketing, administrative, operating, and technical personnel, and to train and manage new personnel. Our ability to implement our business plan is dependent on our ability to retain, hire, and train a large number of qualified employees each year. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover, or increased employee benefit costs.Our risk management strategies may result in losses. From time to time, we may use fixed-price and/or fixed-volume supplier contracts to offset contracts with customers. Some of our existing supply agreements have required minimum purchase quantities. Under adverse economic conditions, those minimums may exceed our needs. Absent exceptions for force majeure and other circumstances affecting the legal enforceability of the agreements, these minimum purchase requirements may compel us to purchase quantities of raw materials that could significantly exceed our anticipated needs or pay damages to the supplier for shortfalls. In these circumstances, we would attempt to negotiate agreements for new purchase quantities. There is a risk, however, that we would not be successful in reducing purchase quantities, either through negotiation or litigation. If that occurred, we would likely be required to purchase more of a particular raw material in a particular year than we need, negatively affecting our results of operations and cash flows.Additionally, we may use commodity contracts, foreign exchange contracts, and interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk, and interest rate risk. These risk management strategies pose certain risks, including the risk that losses on a hedge position may exceed the amount invested in such instruments. Moreover, a party in a hedging transaction may be unavailable or unwilling to settle our obligations, which could cause us to suffer corresponding losses. A hedging instrument may not be effective in eliminating all of the risks inherent in any particular position. Our profitability may be adversely affected during any period as a result of the use of such instruments.RISKS RELATED TO REGULATORY AND LEGAL MATTERSWe could incur substantial costs related to environmental, health, and safety laws. Our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental, health, and safety laws. These include laws that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and establish standards for the treatment, storage, and disposal of regulated materials, and the investigation and remediation of contaminated soil, surface water, and groundwater. Failure to maintain or achieve compliance with these laws or with the permits required for our operations could result in substantial increases in operating costs and capital expenditures. In addition, we may be subject to fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third party claims for property damage or personal injury, worker’s compensation or personal injury claims, cleanup costs, or temporary or permanent discontinuance of operations. Certain of our facilities are located in industrial areas, have a history of heavy industrial use, and have been in operation for many years and, over time, we and other predecessor operators of these facilities have generated, used, handled, and disposed of hazardous and other regulated wastes. Environmental liabilities could exist, including cleanup obligations at these facilities or at off-site locations where materials from our operations were disposed of, which could result in future expenditures that cannot be currently quantified and which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Such liabilities may be imposed without regard to fault or the legality of a party’s conduct and may, in certain circumstances, be joint and several. Future changes to environmental, health, and safety laws, including those related to climate change, could result in material liabilities and costs, constrain operations, or make such operations more costly for us, our suppliers, and our customers. In October 2011, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) named JT Ryerson as one of more than 100 businesses that may be a potentially responsible party for the Portland Harbor Superfund Site. See Note 13: Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report on Form 10-K. As the EPA has not yet allocated responsibility for the contamination among the potentially responsible parties, including JT Ryerson, we do not currently have sufficient information available to us to determine whether the Record of Decision will be executed as currently 18 stated, whether and to what extent JT Ryerson may be held responsible for any of the identified contamination, and how much (if any) of the final plan’s costs might ultimately be allocated to JT Ryerson. Therefore, management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or estimate a range of potential loss at this time.Regulations related to conflict-free minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and place us at a competitive disadvantage. On August 22, 2012, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), the SEC adopted new requirements for reporting companies that use certain minerals and metals, known as “conflict minerals”, in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. These requirements require companies to diligence, disclose, and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to conclusively verify the origins for all metals used in our products and we may face reputational challenges with our customers. Additionally, as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering “conflict free” metals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary metals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Accordingly, we could incur significant costs related to the compliance process, including potential difficulty or added costs in satisfying the disclosure requirements. Moreover, we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.Tax changes could affect our effective tax rate, the value of our deferred tax assets, and future profitability.Our future results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate or changes in the treatment of deferred tax assets as a result of changes in Ryerson’s overall profitability, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax legislation, the results of the examination of previously filed tax returns, and continuing assessment of the Company’s tax exposures. In particular, although the passage of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 reduced the U.S. tax rate to 21%, our future earnings could be negatively impacted by changes in tax legislation including changing tax rates and tax base such as limiting, phasing-out, or eliminating deductions or tax credits, changing rules for earnings repatriations, and changing other tax laws in the U.S. or other countries. We are subject to litigation that could strain our resources and distract management. From time to time, we are involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, and other disputes arising in the ordinary course of business. These suits concern issues including product liability, contract disputes, employee-related matters, and personal injury matters. It is not feasible to predict the outcome of all pending suits and claims, and the ultimate resolution of these matters as well as future lawsuits that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or reputation. We may face product liability claims that are costly and create adverse publicity. If any of the products that we sell cause harm to any of our customers, we could be exposed to product liability lawsuits. If we were found liable under product liability claims, we could be required to pay substantial monetary damages. Further, even if we successfully defended ourselves against this type of claim, we could be forced to spend a substantial amount of money in litigation expenses, our management could be required to spend valuable time in the defense against these claims, and our reputation could suffer.  RISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCKOur stock price has fluctuated in the past, has recently been volatile, and may be volatile in the future, and as a result, investors in our common stock could incur substantial losses.         Our stock price has fluctuated in the past, has recently been volatile, and may be volatile in the future. We may incur rapid and substantial decreases in our stock price in the foreseeable future that are unrelated to our operating performance or prospects.          As a result of this volatility, investors may experience losses on their investment in our common stock. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including the following:  •investor reaction to our business strategy;•the success of competitive products or technologies;19 •any developments with respect to our pursuit of strategic alternatives, including a potential sale or merger of the Company, sale of part of the Company, strategic minority investment, or licensing and other transactions•changes in regulatory or industry standards applicable to our products;•variations in our financial and operating results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;•developments concerning our collaborations or partners;•developments or disputes with any third parties that supply, manufacture, sell, or market any of our products;•actual or perceived defects in any of our products, if commercialized, and any related product liability claims;•our ability or inability to raise additional capital and the terms on which we raise it;•declines in the market prices of stocks generally;•trading volume of our common stock;•sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders;•general economic, industry, and market conditions; and•other events or factors, including those resulting from such events, or the prospect of such events, including war, terrorism, and other international conflicts, public health issues including health epidemics or pandemics, and natural disasters such as fire, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, or other adverse weather and climate conditions, whether occurring in the U.S. or elsewhere, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of our suppliers, or result in political or economic instability.In the past, following periods of volatility in the market, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management's attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects. There can be no guarantee that our stock price will remain at current levels or that future sales of our common stock will not be at prices lower than those sold to investors.We paid cash dividends on our common stock in each quarter of 2022, but any future dividend payments are at the discretion of our Board of Directors.We have recently paid regular quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. Any declaration and payment of cash dividends on our common stock in the future, whether at current levels or at all, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, future prospects, contractual restrictions, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Therefore, you should not rely on dividend income from shares of our common stock. For more information, see “Dividend Policy.” Your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in us may be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and you sell your shares at a profit, but there is no guarantee that the market price for our common stock will ever exceed the price that you pay for our common stock.Our corporate documents and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of the Company.Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our Board of Directors. These provisions:•establish a classified Board of Directors so that not all members of our Board of Directors are elected at one time;•authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;•provide that the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our amended and restated bylaws;•prohibit stockholders from acting by written consent if less than a majority of the voting power of our outstanding stock is controlled by Platinum; and•establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.20 These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.Any issuance of preferred stock could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our common stock, which could depress the price of our common stock.Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue preferred stock and to determine the preferences, limitations, and relative rights of shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Our preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend, and other rights superior to the rights of our common stock. The potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of us, discouraging bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price, and adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.RISKS RELATED TO OUR CAPITAL STRUCTUREWe have indebtedness under our Ryerson Credit Facility, which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations. As of December 31, 2022, our total indebtedness was $367 million and we had approximately $826 million of unused capacity under the Ryerson Credit Facility. Our indebtedness may: •make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our indebtedness; •limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes; •limit our ability to use our cash flow for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes; •require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments; •limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry; •place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and •increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of the Ryerson Credit Facility restrict but do not prohibit us from doing so, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify. The covenants in the Ryerson Credit Facility and covenants contained in agreements governing indebtedness that we incur in the future may impose, restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility. The Ryerson Credit Facility contains a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries, including JT Ryerson, to: •incur additional debt; •make certain investments or other restricted payments; •create liens or use assets as security in other transactions; •merge, consolidate, transfer, or dispose of substantially all of our assets; and •engage in transactions with affiliates. The terms of the Ryerson Credit Facility require that, in the event availability under the facility declines to a certain level, we maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter. Total credit availability is limited by the amount of eligible accounts receivable, inventory, and qualified cash pledged as collateral under the agreement insofar as the Company is subject to a borrowing base comprised of the aggregate of these three amounts, less applicable reserves. As of December 31, 2022, total credit availability under the Ryerson Credit Facility was $826 million. See discussion regarding the Ryerson Credit Facility in Note 10: 21 “Debt” of Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” as well as the discussion within the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”Our future indebtedness may contain covenants more restrictive in certain respects than the restrictions contained in the Ryerson Credit Facility. Operating results below current levels or other adverse factors, including a significant increase in interest rates, could result in our being unable to comply with financial covenants that are contained in the Ryerson Credit Facility or that may be contained in any future indebtedness. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to our stockholders and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. Balances outstanding on the Ryerson Credit Facility and our other outstanding indebtedness are expected to account for significant cash interest expenses. Accordingly, we will have to generate significant cash flows from operations to meet our debt service requirements. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service and working capital requirements, we may be required to sell assets, seek additional capital, reduce capital expenditures, restructure or refinance all or a portion of our existing indebtedness, or seek additional financing. Moreover, insufficient cash flow may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Because the majority of our indebtedness bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain prevailing short-term interest rates, we are vulnerable to interest rate increases. The majority of our indebtedness, including the Ryerson Credit Facility, bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain short-term prevailing interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, we had $365.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Ryerson Credit Facility, with an additional $826 million available for borrowing under such facility. Assuming a consistent level of debt through-out 2022 a 100 basis point increase in the interest rate on our floating rate debt effective from the beginning of the year would increase our interest expense under the Ryerson Credit Facility and the China credit facility by approximately $4.3 million, on an annual basis. The Federal Reserve has increased interest rates throughout 2022 and early 2023, increasing our interest expense on the Ryerson Credit Facility. The expectation is that additional rate hikes will occur in 2023. If interest rates increase dramatically, we could be unable to service our debt, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.  22 Changes in our credit ratings and outlook may reduce access to capital and increase borrowing costs.Our credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and factors outside of our control, such as conditions affecting our industry generally or the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies. We cannot provide assurances that our current credit ratings will remain in effect or that the ratings will not be lowered, suspended, or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies. If rating agencies lower, suspend, or withdraw the ratings, the market price or marketability of our securities may be adversely affected. In addition, any negative change in ratings could make it more difficult for us to raise capital on acceptable terms, impact the ability to obtain adequate financing, and result in higher interest costs for our existing credit facilities, including the Ryerson Credit Facility, or on future financings.RISKS RELATED TO OUR STOCKHOLDER BASEPlatinum owns a significant percentage of our stock and has the right to nominate a majority of the members of the Corporation’s board and will be able to exert control over matters subject to stockholder approval.Platinum owns approximately 15,924,478 shares of our common stock, which is approximately 43% of our issued and outstanding common stock. Therefore, Platinum may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, Platinum may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that our stockholders may believe are in their best interest as stockholders. The Company is party to an investor rights agreement (the “Investor Rights Agreement”) with certain affiliates of Platinum which provides, among other things, that for so long as Platinum collectively beneficially owns (i) at least 30% of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the Company, Platinum will have the right to nominate for election to the board of directors of the Company no fewer than that number of directors that would constitute a majority of the number of directors if there were no vacancies on the board, (ii) at least 15% but less than 30% of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the Company, Platinum will have the right to nominate two directors, and (iii) at least 5% but less than 15% of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the Company, Platinum will have the right to nominate one director. The agreement also provides that if the size of the board of directors is increased or decreased at any time, Platinum’s nomination rights will be proportionately increased or decreased, respectively, rounded up to the nearest whole number. As a result of Platinum’s ownership of a significant portion of the Company’s outstanding capital stock as well its board nomination rights pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, Platinum may significantly influence or effectively control our policies and operations, including the appointment of management, future issuances of our common stock or other securities, and the payment of dividends. In addition, Platinum has significant control over our decisions to enter into any other corporate transaction. The interests of Platinum may not in all cases be aligned with the interests of the other holders of our common stock. For example, a sale of a substantial number of shares of stock in the future by Platinum could cause our stock price to decline. Further, Platinum could cause us to make acquisitions that increase the amount of the indebtedness that is secured or senior to the Company’s existing debt or sell revenue-generating assets, impairing our ability to make payments under such debt. Additionally, Platinum is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Accordingly, Platinum may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, Platinum may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to holders of our common stock"

Ryerson Holding Corporation (“Ryerson Holding”), a Delaware corporation, is the parent company of Joseph T. Ryerson & Son, Inc. (“JT Ryerson”), a Delaware corporation. Affiliates of Platinum Equity, LLC (“Platinum”) own approximately 21,037,500 shares of our common stock, which is approximately 55% of our issued and outstanding common stock. We are a leading metals service center, value-added processor, and distributor of industrial metals with operations in the United States through JT Ryerson, in Canada through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Ryerson Canada, Inc., a Canadian corporation (“Ryerson Canada”), and in Mexico through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Ryerson Metals de Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V., a Mexican corporation (“Ryerson Mexico”). In addition to our North American operations, we conduct processing and distribution operations in China through an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Ryerson China Limited, a Chinese limited liability company (“Ryerson China”). Unless the context indicates otherwise, Ryerson Holding, JT Ryerson, Ryerson Canada, Ryerson Mexico, and Ryerson China together with their subsidiaries, are collectively referred to herein as “Ryerson,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company.” Our Company We are one of the largest value-add processors and distributors of industrial metals in North America measured in terms of sales. We have approximately 4,000 employees across 91 facilities in North America and four facilities in China. Through this network we serve approximately 40,000 customers across a wide range of manufacturing end-markets. Our customers range from local, independently owned fabricators and machine shops to large, international original equipment manufacturers. We carry a full line of nearly 75,000 products in stainless steel, aluminum, carbon steel, and alloy steels and a limited line of nickel and red metals in various shapes and forms. In addition to our metals products, we offer numerous value-added processing and fabrication services, and nearly 80% of the products we sell are processed to meet customer requirements.  Our business strategy includes providing a superior level of customer service and responsiveness, technical services, and inventory management solutions while maintaining low operating costs in order to maximize financial results. Our growth strategy is based on increasing our operating results through organic growth activities and strategic acquisitions.  To that end, we continue to focus on our interconnected network, systems, and to enhance our value-added services and online presence to provide increased access, functionality, and flexibility to our customers. We are using advanced analytics to improve pricing and inventory utilization. Our service centers are strategically located near our customers, which permits us to quickly process and deliver our products and services, often the day after receiving an order. We own, lease, or contract a fleet of tractors and trailers, allowing us to efficiently meet our customers’ delivery demands. Our range of products together with our breadth of services allows us to service a diverse customer base and to create long-term partnerships with our customers and enhances our profitability. We focus on strategic acquisitions that complement and enhance our product, customer, and geographic diversification. Ryerson’s M&A strategy includes both transformative turnaround acquisitions and value-add, bolt-on acquisitions. Recently, Ryerson has focused on bolt-on acquisitions such as its September 1, 2021 acquisition of Specialty Metals Processing, Inc. (“SMP”).  SMP is a toll processor of stainless steel, aluminum, titanium, and nickel alloy products that expanded the Company’s value-add services in a variety of industries including aerospace. SMP was purchased for $14.0 million, net of cash acquired.Industry Overview Metals service centers serve as key intermediaries between metal producers and end users of metal products. They purchase in scale and sell in smaller quantities.  End-users often look for “one-stop” suppliers that offer lower order volumes, shorter lead times, more reliable delivery, and processing services. Metal producers mainly sell metals in the form of standard-sized coils, sheets, plates, structurals, bars, and tubes in large quantities, with longer lead times, and limited inventory. Metal service centers serve as key intermediaries closing the gap between metal producers’ supply and end-users’ demand. By aggregating end-users’ demand and purchasing metal in bulk to take advantage of economies of scale, metals service centers may purchase, process, and deliver metal to end‑users in a more efficient and cost‑effective manner than the end‑user may achieve by dealing directly with the primary producer. Further, specialized metals processing equipment is costly and requires high‑volume production to be cost effective. In addition, many customers are not able or willing to invest in the necessary technology, equipment, and warehousing of inventory to efficiently and effectively perform metal processing for their own operations.  Due to this, many customers have reduced their in-house processing capabilities, opting to source processed metal from service centers like us.  This saves our customers time, labor, and expense, reducing their overall manufacturing costs, while permitting us to focus on value-added 4 services and increasing our fabrication mix. This supports our capital expenditures on processing equipment to grow annual gross profit margin. Our industry is highly fragmented with the largest companies accounting for only a small percentage of total market share. The majority of metals services companies have limited product lines and inventories, with customers located in a specific geographic area. In general, competition is based on quality, service, price, and geographic proximity. We primarily compete with other metals service centers and to a lesser extent with metal producers.  The metals service center industry typically experiences cash flow trends that are counter-cyclical to the revenue and volume growth of the industry. During an industry downturn, companies generally reduce working capital assets and generate cash as inventory and accounts receivable balances decline. As a result, operating cash flow and liquidity tend to increase during a downturn, which typically facilitates industry participants’ ability to cover fixed costs and repay outstanding debt. Competitive Strengths Leading Market Position in North America. Based on sales, we believe we are one of the largest service center companies for carbon, stainless steel, and aluminum in the North American market where we have a broad geographic presence with 91 facilities. Our service centers are located near our customer locations, enabling us to provide timely delivery to customers across numerous geographic markets. Additionally, our widespread network of locations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico helps us to utilize our expertise to more efficiently serve customers with complex supply chain requirements across multiple manufacturing locations. We believe this is a key differentiator for customers who need a supplier that can reliably and consistently support them. Our ability to transfer inventory among our facilities better enables us to more timely and profitably source and process specialized items at regional locations throughout our network than if we were required to maintain inventory of all products and specialized equipment at each location. Broad Geographic Reach Across Attractive End Markets. Our operations serve a diverse range of industries including commercial ground transportation, metal fabrication and machine shops, industrial machinery and equipment manufacturing, consumer durable equipment, HVAC manufacturing, construction equipment manufacturing, food processing and agricultural equipment manufacturing, and oil and gas. We believe this broad range of industries in which we sell our products and services reduces our risk related to a downturn in a specific industry. We believe that our ability to quickly adjust our offering based on regional and industry specific trends creates stability while also providing the opportunity to access specific growth markets. Established Platform for Organic and Acquisition Growth. Our growth strategy is based on increasing our operating results through organic growth activities and strategic acquisitions that enhance our product, customer, and geographic diversification. Our strategies, include investing in value-added processing capabilities, analytically targeting attractive customers and end markets with our supply chain optimization service model, industry consolidation through targeted M&A, and providing customers faster and easier solutions to their metal needs, which we believe will provide us with growth opportunities. Given the highly fragmented nature of the metals service center industry, we believe there are numerous additional opportunities to acquire businesses and incorporate them into our existing infrastructure. In addition, due to our large scale and geographic reach, we believe we can improve operating performance through efficiencies by integrating acquired businesses into our operational model, thus providing greater purchasing power, improving expense and working capital management, access to additional end markets, and broadening product mix. Lean Operating Structure Providing Operating Leverage. Ryerson has demonstrated the ability to effectively manage expenses through tactical productivity and spending improvements.  In a stronger metals service center environment characterized by increases in demand and/or pricing, we believe that most additional expenses to service higher revenue and margins would come from variable expenses while further leveraging economies of scale on our existing fixed expenses. In 2021, although impacted by supply chain tightness, industry volumes improved compared to 2020. In response to increased volumes, our warehousing, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased by $156.9 million compared to 2020, but decreased as a percentage of sales by 350 basis points, illustrating our ability to manage cost pressures and realize expense leverage. 5 Throughout 2021, we continued to focus on and execute strong inventory management and had average inventory days excluding LIFO of 73 days in 2021, within our target inventory range. Extensive Breadth of Products and Services for Diverse Customer Base. We believe our broad product mix and marketing approach provides customers with a “one-stop shop” solution few other metals service center companies are able to offer. We provide a broad range of processing and fabrication services to meet the needs of our approximately 40,000 customers and typically fulfill more than 1,100,000 orders per year. We provide supply chain solutions, including just-in-time delivery and value-added processing to many original equipment manufacturing customers. For the year ended December 31, 2021, no single customer, including their subcontractors, accounted for more than 5% of our sales, and our top 10 customers, including their subcontractors accounted for less than 13% of our sales. Strong Relationships with Suppliers. We are among the largest purchasers of metals in North America and have long-term relationships with many of our North American suppliers. We believe we are frequently one of the largest customers of our suppliers and that concentrating our orders among a core group of suppliers is effective for obtaining favorable pricing and service. We believe we have the opportunity to further leverage this strength through continued focus on price and volume using an analytics-driven approach to procurement. In addition, we view our strategic suppliers as supply chain partners. We focus on logistics, lead times, rolling schedules, and scrap return programs to drive value-based buying that is advantageous for us. Metals producers worldwide are consolidating, and large, geographically diversified customers, such as Ryerson, are desirable partners for these larger suppliers. Our relationships with suppliers often provide us with access to metals when supply is constrained. Through our knowledge of the global metals marketplace and capabilities of specific mills, we believe we have developed an advantageous global purchasing strategy. Experienced Management Team with Deep Industry Knowledge. Our senior management team has extensive industry and operational experience and has been instrumental in optimizing and implementing our strategy. Our senior management has an average of more than 30 years of experience in the metals or service center industries. Our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and President, Mr. Edward Lehner, who joined the Company in August 2012 as Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and became CEO in June 2015, has 30 years of experience, predominantly in the metals industry. Mr. Mike Burbach, our Chief Operating Officer, has over 38 years of experience with the Company and previously served as the President, North-West Region of the Company. Mr. Jim Claussen, Executive Vice President & CFO, has 27 years of industry experience. Industry Outlook The Institute for Supply Management’s Purchasing Managers’ Index (“PMI”) reported growth throughout 2021 with readings above 50%, indicating expansion in factory activity. This growth trend continued into 2022 with a reading of 57.6 for January. While PMI reported contraction in March, April, and May of 2020 due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S., PMI has overall reported general economic expansion for the last three years as readings have exceeded 50% for 28 of the last 36 months. The PMI measures the economic health of the manufacturing sector and is a composite index based on five indicators: new orders, inventory levels, production, supplier deliveries, and the employment environment. PMI readings can be a good indicator of industrial activity and general economic growth. Additionally, the Department of Commerce announced that real GDP increased 5.7 percent in 2021 and the Federal Reserve projected that the median growth rate in real GDP would be 4.0%, 2.2%, and 2.0% for 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively. Steel demand in North America is largely dependent on growth of the automotive, industrial equipment, consumer appliance, and construction end markets. Our end markets are supported by the strength of the manufacturing economy, and according to the latest Livingston Survey, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, U.S. industrial production is expected to have expanded by 5.5% in 2021 and is further expected to grow by 4.2% in 2022 and 2.8% in 2023. Products and Services We carry a full line of carbon steel, stainless steel, alloy steels, and aluminum, and a limited line of nickel and red metals. These materials are stocked in a number of shapes, including coils, sheets, rounds, hexagons, square and flat bars, plates, structurals, and tubing.6 We also provide a wide variety of processing services to meet our customers’ needs. Most of the products that we carry require expensive specialized equipment for material handling and processing. We believe few of our customers have the capability to process the metal into the desired sizes, forms, or finishes or they are unwilling to incur the significant capital expenditures to acquire the necessary equipment. We are growing and diversifying our product mix mainly as a result of our targeted growth strategy to provide increased levels of value-added processing services. We believe our enhanced processing capabilities will increase our ability to sell higher-margin metals processing services to a larger group of customers. We expect this, together and with our focus on maintaining pricing discipline related to our processing services, will increase our gross profit margin.We had capital expenditures of $194.6 million in the five-year period ended December 31, 2021. We are increasing our investments in processing equipment due to customers requesting higher levels of value-added processing.  We expect this to increase our profitability. We currently perform processing services on nearly 80% of the materials sold by us. The following pie charts show our percentage of sales by major product lines for 2021 and 2020:  We are not dependent on any particular customer group or industry because we process and distribute a variety of metals. This diversity of product type and material reduces our exposure to fluctuations or other weaknesses in the financial or economic stability of particular customers or industries. We are also less dependent on any particular suppliers as a result of our product diversification. See pie charts showing our sales by metal consuming industry within “Customers and Markets” discussion below.Customers and Markets Our customer base is diverse, numbering approximately 40,000 in a variety of industries, including metal fabrication and machine shops, industrial machinery and equipment, commercial ground transportation, consumer durable, food processing and agricultural equipment, construction equipment, and HVAC. Although we sell directly to many large original equipment manufacturers, the majority of our sales are to smaller customers, including small machine shops and fabricators, in small quantities with frequent deliveries, helping them manage their working capital and credit needs more efficiently.For the year ended December 31, 2021, no single customer, including their subcontractors, accounted for more than 5% of our sales, and our top 10 customers, including their subcontractors accounted for approximately 13% of our sales. Substantially all of our sales are attributable to our U.S. operations and substantially all of our long-lived assets are located in the United States. 7 The following pie charts show the Company’s percentage of sales by metal consuming industry for 2021 and 2020: Our customers are primarily located throughout the United States, but we also have international customers. Most customers are located near one of our facilities, thus enabling an efficient delivery system capable of handling a high frequency of short lead time orders. We transport our products directly to customers via our in-house and dedicated truck fleet, which further supports the just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers, and via third-party trucking firms.We process our metals to specific customer orders as well as for stocking programs. Many of our larger customers commit to purchase on a regular basis at agreed upon or indexed prices for periods ranging from three to twelve months. To help mitigate price volatility risks, these price commitments are generally matched with corresponding supply arrangements, or to a lesser degree by commodity hedges. Customers notify us of specific release dates for processed products. Customers typically notify us of release dates anywhere from on a just-in-time basis to one month before the release date. Consequently, we are required to carry sufficient inventory to meet the short lead time and just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers. We also have international facilities located in Canada, Mexico, and China.  Net sales of our international locations (based on where the shipments originated) accounted for 9.7% of our consolidated 2021 net sales, or $551.6 million. See Note 14 — “Segment information” of Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further information on U.S. and foreign revenues and assets.Customer demand may change from time to time based on, among other things, general economic conditions and industry capacity. Many of the industries in which our customers compete are cyclical in nature. We believe that our various and diverse offerings, ways-to-markets, and end markets reduce the volatility of our business in the aggregate, thus somewhat reducing earnings volatility.  A portion of our customers experience seasonal slowdowns. Our sales, as measured in tonnage sold, in the months of July, November, and December traditionally have been lower than in other months because of a reduced number of shipping days and holiday or vacation closures for some customers. Consequently, our sales in the first two quarters of the year are usually higher than in the third and fourth quarters.Suppliers We purchase the majority of our inventories from key domestic metals suppliers. Because of our total volume of purchases and our long‑term relationships with our suppliers, we believe that we are generally able to purchase inventory at the best prices offered by our suppliers.For the year ended December 31, 2021, our top 25 suppliers, including their subcontractors, accounted for approximately 77% of our purchase dollars. We are generally able to meet our materials requirements because we use many suppliers, there is a substantial overlap of product offerings from these suppliers, and there are several other suppliers able to provide identical or similar products. While the metals producing supply base has experienced significant consolidation and supply interruptions during the past 8 year, we believe both our size and our long-term relationships with our suppliers has enabled us to meet our material requirements and will continue to allow us to do so in the future. Sales and Marketing We maintain our own professional sales force. In addition to our office sales staff, we market and sell our products through the use of our field sales force that we believe has extensive product and customer knowledge and offers a comprehensive catalog of our products. Our office and field sales staff, which together consist of approximately 800 employees, include technical personnel. Additionally, we offer our customers the ability to purchase our products through our e-commerce website.Because much of our business is relationship-based, we operate under many different trade names. Businesses we acquire often have strong customer relationships and solid reputations, and we will often continue to use the acquired business name to maintain existing customer relationships.Capital Expenditures In 2021, we continued to focus on organic growth by expanding existing facilities and adding processing equipment. Investments by us in property, plant, and equipment, together with asset retirements for the five years ended December 31, 2021, excluding the initial purchase price of acquisitions are set forth below. The net capital change during such period aggregated to an increase of $38.0 million.    Additions  Retirementsor Sales  Net   (In millions) 2021 $59.3  $68.5   (9.2)2020  26.0   0.2   25.8 2019  45.8   57.5   (11.7)2018  38.4   5.5   32.9 2017  25.1   24.9   0.2  The net reductions in 2019 and 2021 are related to sale lease-back transactions. See Part II, Item 8, Note 5: Property, Plant, and Equipment for additional information on the 2021 sale-leaseback transactions. The lower amount of additions in 2020 was caused by maintenance capital expenditures deferred to 2021 as spending was reduced due to uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. We currently anticipate capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, of up to approximately $100 million for 2022, much of which is related to organic activities comprised of maintenance and purchases geared towards highly accretive growth projects. We expect nearly half of the 2022 capital expenditures to be funded using proceeds from the 2021 sale-leasebacks of two properties with the remainder funded from cash generated by operations and available borrowings. We will continue to evaluate and execute each growth project in light of the economic conditions and outlook at the time of investment and may significantly reduce our capital expenditures if economic conditions warrant a more conservative approach to capital allocation. For the long term, we expect capital expenditures to normalize to a rate that approximates depreciation.Environmental, Health, and Safety Matters Our facilities and operations are subject to many foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and to health and safety. In particular, our operations are subject to extensive requirements relating to waste disposal, recycling, air and water emissions, the handling of regulated materials, remediation, underground storage tanks, asbestos-containing building materials, workplace exposure, and other matters. We believe that our operations are currently in substantial compliance with all such laws and do not presently anticipate substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future in order to meet environmental, workplace health or safety requirements, or to pay for any investigations, corrective action, or claims. However, claims, enforcement actions, or investigations regarding personal injury, property damage, or violation of environmental laws could result in substantial costs to us, divert our management’s attention, and result in significant liabilities, fines, or the suspension or interruption of our facilities. We continue to analyze and implement safeguards to mitigate any environmental, health, and safety risks we may face. As a result, additional costs and liabilities may be incurred to comply with future requirements or to address newly discovered conditions, and these costs and liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. For example, there is increasing likelihood that additional regulation of greenhouse gas emissions will occur at the foreign, federal, state, and local level, which could affect us, our suppliers, and our customers. While the costs of compliance could be significant, given the uncertain outcome and timing of future action by the U.S. federal government and states on this issue, we cannot accurately predict the 9 financial impact of future greenhouse gas regulations on our operations or our customers at this time. We do not currently anticipate any new programs disproportionately impacting us compared to our competitors. Some of the properties currently or previously owned or leased by us are located in industrial areas or have a long history of heavy industrial use. We may incur environmental liabilities with respect to these properties in the future including costs of investigations, corrective action, claims for natural resource damages, claims by third parties relating to property damages, or claims relating to contamination at sites where we have sent waste for treatment or disposal. Based on currently available information we do not expect any investigation, remediation matters, or claims related to properties presently or formerly owned, operated, or to which we have sent waste for treatment or disposal would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. In October 2011, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) named JT Ryerson as one of more than 100 businesses that may be a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) for the Portland Harbor Superfund Site (the “PHS Site”). On January 6, 2017, the EPA issued an initial Record of Decision (“ROD”) regarding the site. The ROD includes a combination of dredging, capping, and enhanced natural recovery that would take approximately thirteen years to construct plus additional time for monitored natural recovery, at an estimated present value cost of $1.05 billion. At a December 4, 2018 meeting with the Portland Harbor Participation and Common Interest Group (“PCI Group”), of which JT Ryerson is a member, the EPA indicated that it expected PRPs to submit a plan during 2019 to start remediation of the river and harbor per the ROD within the next two to three years. The EPA also indicated that it expected allocation of amounts among the parties to be determined in the same two to three-year time frame.The EPA met with various PRPs throughout 2019 and 2020 regarding remedial design. The EPA did not include JT Ryerson in those meetings.  It did include Schnitzer Steel, which is developing a remedial design plan for the river area which includes the area where the former JT Ryerson facilities were located. Schnitzer Steel’s 2020 disclosures filed with the EPA acknowledged that Schnitzer Steel is the legal successor to the prior operators (including JT Ryerson) in the designated area. On February 12, 2021, the EPA announced that one hundred percent (100%) of the PHS Site is now in the active remedial design phase. In June 2021, the EPA issued a Fact Sheet setting forth the status of the entire site. The primary area of relevance for JT Ryerson is River Mile 3.5 East, with Swan Island Basin being of secondary interest. For River Mile 3.5, remedial design work is ongoing; the Sufficiency Assessment and the Pre-Design Investigation work plans are finalized, and design investigation sampling is underway. Schnitzer Steel and MMGL Corp. are the working parties for River Mile 3.5. For Swan Island, remedial design is just beginning, with Daimler Trucks, Shipyard Commerce, and various government entities as the working parties. JT Ryerson has not been asked to participate in the remedial design phase. The PCI Group has engaged a third party to prepare cost estimates for each of the Sediment Management Areas at the site. That work is still in progress and is expected to be completed in early 2022. Once the cost estimates are completed, the voting parties of the PCI Group (which does not include JT Ryerson) will likely begin the “advocacy process,” during which the voting parties submit written arguments to the Allocation Team regarding how costs should be allocated among the various PRPs. This process is anticipated to be completed sometime in 2022. Once the advocacy process is completed, the Allocation Team will prepare a proposed allocation of costs among the PRPs. All PRPs, including JT Ryerson, will then participate in the “mediation process,” during which the PRPs will attempt to agree on a final cost allocation. The mediation process is currently anticipated to occur sometime in 2022 or 2023. The EPA has stated that it is willing to consider de minimis settlements, which JT Ryerson is trying to pursue; however, the EPA has not begun meeting with any of the smaller parties who have requested de minimis or de micromis status, stating that it does not have sufficient information to determine whether any parties meet such criteria and does not intend to begin those considerations until after the remedial design work is completed. It has met with selected parties that we believe to be larger targets. JT Ryerson has not been invited to meet with the EPA. As a result of the ongoing negotiations and filings over the ROD and the EPA’s decision not to meet with smaller parties, we cannot determine how allocations will be made and whether a de minimus settlement can be reached with the EPA. As the EPA has not yet allocated responsibility for the contamination among the potentially responsible parties, including JT Ryerson, we do not currently have sufficient information available to us to determine whether the ROD will be executed as currently stated, whether and to what extent JT Ryerson may be held responsible for any of the identified contamination, and how much (if any) of the final plan’s costs might ultimately be allocated to JT Ryerson. Therefore, management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or estimate a range of potential loss at this time. There are various other claims and pending actions against the Company. The amount of liability, if any, for those claims and actions as of December 31, 2021 is not determinable but, in the opinion of management, such liability, if any, will not have a material 10 adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We maintain liability insurance coverage to assist in protecting our assets from losses arising from or related to activities associated with business operations. Our United States operations are also subject to the Department of Transportation Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations. We operate a private trucking motor fleet for making deliveries to some of our customers. Our drivers do not carry any material quantities of hazardous materials. Our foreign operations are subject to similar regulations. Future regulations could increase maintenance, replacement, and fuel costs for our fleet. These costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. Intellectual Property We own several U.S. and foreign trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Certain of the trademarks are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and, in certain circumstances, with the trademark offices of various foreign countries. We consider certain other information owned by us to be trade secrets. We protect our trade secrets by, among other things, entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees regarding such matters and implementing measures to restrict access to sensitive data and computer software source code on a need-to-know basis. We believe that these safeguards adequately protect our proprietary rights and we vigorously defend these rights. While we consider all our intellectual property rights as a whole to be important, we do not consider any single right to be essential to our operations as a whole. Environmental, Social and Governance Ryerson is committed to operating with a high level of integrity. We are driven by our dedication to support our employees and the communities we serve, deliver products that meet our stringent quality and compliance standards, and maintain high environmental, health, and safety standards to protect our people and the places where we operate. We work to continually improve each of these areas to make Ryerson an even better company for tomorrow.Below are some highlights of our corporate responsibility programs. SustainabilityAs part of our efforts to operate with a high level of integrity, we continuously monitor and analyze ourselves and our supply-chain relationships.  We strive, and expect our suppliers, to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and Ryerson's Human Rights Policy, Conflict Minerals Policy, and Code of Ethics and Business Conduct.We are committed to mitigating the impact our operations and products have on the environment. As an operator of metals service centers, our day-to-day business consists of the sale, distribution, and processing of a broad variety of metal products sourced from numerous primary metal producers. Our operations, by their nature, do not emit significant amounts of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases. Further, according to the Steel Recycling Institute, we believe steel, one of our most significant products, is the most recycled material on the planet—more than plastic, paper, and glass combined each year—which provides a strong foundation for our sustainability efforts. The Steel Recycling Institute notes that two out of every three tons of new steel are produced from old steel. As part of our commitment to environmental sustainability, we: •Sell carbon, steel, and aluminum, which are 100% recyclable and can be recycled many times over to create new products without loss of quality  •Purchase significant volumes of metal that have been produced using recycled materials or scrap melted in Electric Arc Furnaces  •Source most of our steel from North American metal producers, which have substantially lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to other world producers •Sell scrap material generated in our operations to recyclers •Work with our customers to reduce carbon emissions throughout their value chainWe also use propane fuel to operate forklifts, have installed energy efficient lighting in many of our facilities, and utilize energy efficient diesel tractors that consume less fuel and reduce emissions for the majority of our trucking fleet to further mitigate our impact on the environment.  11 Community & Social VitalityBeing a responsible neighbor and helping build better communities in the areas we operate is a central part of our company culture. We understand that supporting our communities through giving back is an important and increasing interest of our current and future employees.Employees are provided the opportunity to volunteer their time in the communities they call home through the Ryerson Gives Back program. Established in 2017, Ryerson Gives Back encourages teams across the Company to volunteer in their community, allotting four paid volunteer hours annually to each employee. From food banks to local construction projects, we have watched employees step up to support underserved groups and areas on behalf of Ryerson.In addition to giving back, we encourage employees to exercise their civic responsibilities. Employees were granted an additional four hours of paid time off to vote in the 2020 presidential election. We also support various charitable organizations, including those that promote social justice and equality, good health, children's causes, educational advancement, and community programs.Human CapitalIn order to provide best in class customer experiences, it is crucial that we continue to work to attract and retain top talent. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to create a diverse, inclusive, and safe workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation, benefits, and wellness programs, and by programs that build connections between our employees and their communities. Employees. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 3,700 persons in North America and 300 persons in China. Our North American workforce was comprised of approximately 1,600 office employees and approximately 2,100 plant employees. Seventeen percent of our plant employees were members of various unions, including the United Steel Workers and The International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Five renewal contracts covering 100 employees were successfully negotiated in 2021. Four contracts covering 104 employees are currently scheduled to expire in 2022.Employee Development & Engagement. Ryerson believes in promoting from within and provides the resources for long-term career development.  Our summer internship program and Ryerson Academy provide meaningful training to entry-level employees.  Ryerson Academy is a unique, 12-week immersive training program that runs three sessions per year for entry-level inside sales associates. The program provides intensive training and experience in sales and customer service with up to 15 participants in each session. Ryerson Academy also teaches critical communication, negotiation, and presentation skills, and participants regularly interact with Ryerson’s senior leadership and subject matter experts. For decades, we have supported the continuing education of our employees’ families through a college scholarship program. In 2021, as part of this program, we awarded almost $32,000 in academic scholarships to students graduating from high school that are children or dependents of Ryerson employees. We also support the continuing education of our employees through tuition reimbursement programs.We have a robust training platform, Ryerson EDvantage, available to all employees which offers Ryerson product training along with general skills courses that are customized for our employees’ development.  We focus on succession planning and ensure that proper cross-training and knowledge transfer is in place. Our commitment to listening to and working with our employees led to the launch of our company-wide engagement survey in 2018.  Using Quantum Workplace, a leading engagement survey software, our employees anonymously provided their perspectives on a variety of topics. Ryerson achieved overall favorability of 67% with a participation rate of nearly 80%, which exceeded industry benchmarks. We distributed the results to our department heads and managers to hold team meetings to discuss the outcomes and gain additional insights. We identified key improvement opportunities and established advisory teams to address them. In early 2020, we conducted a follow-up “pulse” survey with a subset of the organization and, encouragingly, found that favorability scores increased in locations where leaders had worked to affect change. From this collective effort came company-wide initiatives including new health and wellness programs and improved sick, vacation, and parental leave policies for U.S. employees. Diversity and Inclusion. Ryerson is dedicated to building a diverse workplace of associates from a variety of cultures, educational backgrounds, and life experiences. A well-rounded community of talent helps cultivate new ideas and perspectives that help the Company expand its thinking and refine its practices and processes to continue growing in a smart way. Ryerson is aggressively working to engage diverse and under-represented individuals through its recruiting efforts in diverse and underserved communities. We have a Diversity & Inclusion Council whose mission is to foster an environment across the organization that values 12 diversity of experiences and perspectives and encourages inclusivity in all aspects of the business. Only by respecting each of our unique perspectives, experiences, and needs can we unlock the full potential of our workforce and attract the best talent. The council seeks to achieve this through: •Developing cultural competence and responsiveness as an organization,  •Building capacity, capability, and competency to lead a diverse workforce, •Creating a work environment that provides equal access to information and opportunities for professional growth and advancement, and •Developing, implementing, and continuously improving guided conversations across the organization on diversity and inclusion.We promote the advancement of women in our organization through our Women’s Sponsorship Program which provides sponsorship of women in various levels and positions throughout the organization. Ryerson’s employees also participate in Association of Women in the Metals Industry membership and events. Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, we adopted a new parental leave policy which provides all U.S. non-union, full-time employees with four weeks of fully paid parental leave plus eight weeks of fully paid maternity leave. From a governance perspective, Ryerson has adopted a Code of Ethics & Business Conduct, a Board Corporate Governance Guidelines and Nominating Corporate Governance Committee Charter, an Equal Employment Opportunity Policy, and Anti-harassment Policy to support our diversity, equity, and inclusion values. Our Board of Directors and Compensation Committee provide oversight of our policies, programs, and initiatives focusing on workforce diversity and inclusion.Employee Safety.  Upholding a safe workplace is one of our core values and a part of the company's culture. Our safety standards, which go beyond the minimum requirements required by applicable law, have helped protect the well-being of our people and prevent workplace injuries that can impact business productivity. We continuously work to maintain a safety performance rating that consistently outperforms the industry average and have implemented an Environmental, Health, and Safety policy that reinforces the goal of a zero-injury workplace. Our low recordable injury rate compared to our peers in the metal services industry, based on U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) criteria, reflects our effectiveness in protecting our employees. Our 2021 performance at our facilities, measured as the number of OSHA recordable injuries per 200,000 labor hours, was 2.08, which was better than the industry average as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Health and Wellness. The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and convenient health and wellness programs, including benefits that provide protection and security so they can have peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or that impact their financial well-being; that support their physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status, and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors; and that offer choice where possible so they can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interests of our employees and the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations, such as having office employees work from home and implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work.Compensation and Benefits. We provide robust compensation and benefits programs to help meet the financial needs of our employees. In addition to salaries, we provide annual and quarterly sales incentive plans, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, retirement savings contribution matching, paid time off, parental and maternity leave, employee assistance programs, and tuition assistance. Additionally, we have targeted equity-based grant programs with vesting conditions to facilitate retention of personnel, particularly those with critical skills and experience.Available Information All periodic and current reports and other filings that we are required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are available free of charge from the SEC’s website (www.sec.gov) or through our Investor Relations website at http://ir.ryerson.com.

Our website and the information contained therein or connected thereto are not incorporated into this annual report on Form 10-K. ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS. Our business faces many risks. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the other information in this report, including the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors below will not occur. These risks could have a material and adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRYWeakness in the economy, market trends, and other conditions affecting the profitability and financial stability of our customers could negatively impact our sales growth and results of operations. Economic and industry trends affect our business environments. We serve several metals-consuming industries in which the demand for our products and services is sensitive to the production activity, capital spending, and demand for products and services of our customers. Many of these customers operate in markets that are subject to highly cyclical fluctuations resulting from seasonality, market uncertainty, costs of goods sold, currency exchange rates, foreign competition, offshoring of production, oil and natural gas prices, geopolitical developments, and a variety of other factors beyond our control. Any of these factors could cause customers to idle or close facilities, delay purchases, reduce production levels, or experience reductions in the demand for their own products or services.Any of these events could impair the ability of our customers to make full and timely payments or reduce the volume of products and services these customers purchase from us and could cause increased pressure on our selling prices and terms of sale. We do not expect the cyclical nature of our industry to change and any downturn in our customers’ industries could reduce our revenues and profitability or a significant or prolonged slowdown in activity in the U.S., Canada, or any other major world economy, or a segment of any such economy, could negatively impact our sales growth and results of operations.The metals services business is very competitive and increased competition could reduce our revenues and gross margins. We face competition in all markets we serve, from metals producers that sell directly to certain customers or segments of the market, to other metal services companies.  The metals services industry itself is highly fragmented and competitive. There are a few large competitors, but most of the market is served by small local and regional competitors. Competition is based principally on price, service, quality, production capabilities, inventory availability, and timely delivery. We are experiencing increased pressure from online businesses that compete with price transparency. We expect technological advancements and the increased use of e-commerce solutions within the industry to continue to evolve at a rapid pace. As a result, our ability to effectively compete requires us to respond and adapt to new industry trends and developments, and implement new technology and innovations that may result in unexpected costs or may take longer than expected. To remain competitive, we must be willing and able to respond to market pressures. These pressures, and the implementation, timing, and results of our strategic pricing and other responses, could have a material effect on our sales and profitability. If we are unable to grow sales or reduce costs, among other actions, to wholly or partially offset the effect on profitability of our pricing actions, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.  Changing metals prices may have a significant impact on our liquidity, net sales, gross margins, operating income, and net income. The metals services industry as a whole is cyclical and, at times, pricing and availability of metal can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control, including general domestic and international economic conditions, labor costs, sales levels, competition, levels of inventory held by other metals service centers, consolidation of metals producers, higher raw material costs for the producers of metals, import duties and tariffs, and currency exchange rates. This volatility can significantly affect the availability and cost of materials for us.  Our ability to pass on increases in costs in a timely manner depends on market conditions and may result in lower gross margins. In addition, higher prices could impact demand for these products, resulting in lower sales volumes. Moreover, we maintain substantial inventories of metal to accommodate the short lead times and just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers. Accordingly, we purchase metals in an effort to maintain inventory at levels that we believe to be appropriate to satisfy 14 the anticipated needs of our customers based upon historic buying practices, contracts with customers, and market conditions. Commitments for metal purchases are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time orders are placed or at the time of shipment. During periods of rising metal prices, we may be negatively impacted by delays between the time of increases in the cost of metals to us and increases in the prices that we charge for our products if we are unable to pass these increased costs on to our customers. In addition, when metal prices decline, this could result in lower selling prices for our products and, as we use existing inventory that we purchased at higher metal prices, lower gross profit margins. Declines in prices or further reductions in sales volumes could adversely impact our ability to maintain our liquidity and to remain in compliance with certain financial covenants under our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility (“the Ryerson Credit Facility”), as well as result in us incurring inventory or goodwill impairment charges. Consequently, changing metals prices could significantly impact our liquidity, net sales, gross margins, operating income, and net income. Unexpected product shortages could negatively impact customer relationships, resulting in an adverse impact on results of operations. Disruptions could occur due to factors beyond our control, including economic downturns, political unrest, port slowdowns, trade issues, including increased export or import duties or trade restrictions, health crises, and other factors, any of which could adversely affect a supplier’s ability to manufacture or deliver products to us. Public health problems may result in quarantines, business closures, transportation restrictions, import and export complications, and otherwise cause shortages in the supply of materials, higher costs for available supplies, or cause other disruptions within our operations and supply chain. Public health problems may cause increased costs of certain supplies and disruptions and delays within our supply chain, and may expose us to unanticipated liability or require us to change our business practices. Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in shipments of products or difficulties in obtaining products, any of which may expose us to unanticipated liability or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For our sources of lower cost products from Asia and other areas of the world, the effect of disruptions is typically increased due to the additional lead time required and distances involved.  Further, the risk of disruption is increased due to the current political climate seeking trade reform. In addition, we have strategic relationships with a number of vendors. In the event we are unable to maintain those relations, there might be a loss of competitive pricing advantages which could, in turn, adversely affect results of operations.Changes in customer or product mix could cause our gross margin percentage to decline. From time to time, we experience changes in customer and product mix that affect gross margin. Changes in customer and product mix result primarily from business acquisitions, changes in customer demand, customer acquisitions, selling and marketing activities, and competition. If rapid growth with lower margin customers occurs, we will face pressure to maintain current gross margins, as these customers receive more discounted pricing due to their higher sales volume. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain historical gross margins in the future.We may not be able to retain or expand our customer base if the North American manufacturing industry erodes through acquisition and merger or consolidation activity in our customers’ industries. Our customer base primarily includes manufacturing and industrial firms. Some of our customers operate in industries that are undergoing consolidation through acquisition and merger activity and some customers have closed as they were unable to compete successfully with overseas competitors. Our facilities are predominately located in the United States and Canada. To the extent that our customers cease U.S. operations or relocate to regions in which we do not have a presence, we could lose their business. Acquirers of manufacturing and industrial firms may have suppliers of choice that do not include us, which could impact our customer base and market share. Global metal overcapacity and imports of metal products into the United States have adversely affected, and may again adversely affect, United States metal prices, which could impact our sales and results of operations.At times, global metal production capacity may exceed global consumption of metal products. Such excess capacity sometimes results in metal manufacturers in certain countries exporting steel at prices that are lower than prevailing domestic prices and sometimes at or below their cost of production. Excessive imports of metal into the United States, such as in recent years, have exerted and may exert in the future, downward pressure on United States steel prices which may negatively affect our results of operations.15 Lead time and the cost of our products could increase if we were to lose one of our primary suppliers. If, for any reason, our primary suppliers of aluminum, carbon steel, stainless steel, or other metals should curtail or discontinue their delivery of such metals in the quantities needed and at prices that are competitive, our business could suffer. The number of available suppliers could be reduced by factors such as industry consolidation and bankruptcies affecting steel and metal producers. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our top 25 suppliers represented approximately 77% of our purchases. We could be significantly and adversely affected if delivery were disrupted from a major supplier. If, in the future, we were unable to obtain sufficient amounts of the necessary metals at competitive prices and on a timely basis from our traditional suppliers, we may not be able to obtain such metals from alternative sources at competitive prices to meet our delivery schedules, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. RISKS RELATED TO MARKET AND ECONOMIC VOLATILITYChanges in inflation may adversely affect financial performance. Fluctuations in inflation, could result in lower revenues, higher costs, and decreased margins, profits, and earnings. Rapid or significant inflation could increase the costs we incur to procure, process, package, and deliver our metal to customers and we may not be able to increase selling prices to customers at the same rate, resulting in decreased margins and operating profits. Prolonged periods of deflation could adversely affect the degree to which we are able to maintain or increase selling prices resulting in decreased revenues, margins, and operating profits.  We monitor the risk that the principal markets in which we operate could experience increased inflationary conditions. The onset, duration, and severity of an inflationary period cannot be estimated with precision.The volatility of the market could result in a material impairment of goodwill. We evaluate goodwill annually on October 1 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment. Events or changes in circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to our historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner or the use of our assets or the strategy for our overall business, and significant negative industry or economic trends. We test for impairment of goodwill by assessing various qualitative factors with respect to development in our business and the overall economy and calculating the fair value of a reporting unit using a combination of an income approach based on discounted future cash flows and a market approach at the date of valuation, as necessary. Under the discounted cash flow method, the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated based on expected future economic benefits discounted to a present value at a rate of return commensurate with the risk associated with the investment. Projected cash flows are discounted to present value using an estimated weighted average cost of capital, which considers both returns to equity and debt investors. Please refer to the Section titled “Critical Accounting Estimates - Goodwill,” of Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations,” and Note 1 — “Summary of Accounting and Financial Policies” of Part II, Item 8 ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" for further information.Poor investment performance or other factors could require us to make significant unplanned contributions to our pension plan and future funding for postretirement employee benefits other than pensions also may require substantial payments from current cash flow. We provide defined benefit pension plans for certain eligible employees and retirees. The performance of the debt and equity markets affect the value of plan assets. A decline in the market value may increase the funding requirements for these plans. The cost of providing pension benefits is also affected by other factors, including interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels, the rate of return on plan assets, discount rates used in determining future benefit obligations, future government regulation, and prior contributions to the plans. Significant unanticipated changes in any of these factors may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. RISKS RELATED TO EXPANSION AND INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONSWe may not be able to successfully consummate and complete the integration of future acquisitions, and if we are unable to do so, it could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs and/or decreases in revenues and results of operations. We have grown through a combination of internal expansion, acquisitions, and joint ventures. We intend to continue to grow through selective acquisitions, but we may not be able to identify appropriate acquisition candidates, obtain financing on satisfactory terms, consummate acquisitions, or integrate acquired businesses effectively and profitably into our existing operations. Restrictions contained in the agreements governing our notes, the Ryerson Credit Facility, or our other existing or future debt may also inhibit our ability to make certain investments, including acquisitions, and participations in joint ventures. 16 Acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures, and other business combination transactions, both foreign and domestic, involve various inherent risks, such as uncertainties in assessing value, strengths, weaknesses, liabilities, and potential profitability. There is also risk relating to our ability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from the transactions. Additionally, problems could arise from the integration of acquired businesses, including unanticipated changes in the business or industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition. Our future success will depend on our ability to complete the integration of these future acquisitions successfully into our operations. Specifically, after any acquisition, customers may choose to diversify their supply chains to reduce reliance on a single supplier for a portion of their metals needs. We may not be able to retain all of our and an acquisition’s customers, which may adversely affect our business and sales. Integrating acquisitions, particularly large acquisitions, requires us to enhance our operational and financial systems and employ additional qualified personnel, management, and financial resources, and may adversely affect our business by diverting management away from day-to-day operations. Further, failure to successfully integrate acquisitions may adversely affect our profitability by creating significant operating inefficiencies that could increase our operating expenses as a percentage of sales and reduce our operating income. In addition, we may not realize expected cost savings from acquisitions. Any one or more of these factors could cause us to not realize the benefits anticipated or have a negative impact on the fair value of the reporting units. Accordingly, goodwill and intangible assets recorded as a result of acquisitions could become impaired.Certain of our operations are located outside of the United States, which subjects us to risks associated with international activities. Certain of our operations are located outside of the United States, primarily in Canada, China, and Mexico. We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making corrupt payments or otherwise corruptly giving anything of value to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment, and requires companies to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices. The FCPA applies to covered companies, individual directors, officers, employees, and agents. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for some actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives. If we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA, governmental authorities in the United States could seek to impose civil and/or criminal penalties. Our international operations and potential joint ventures may cause us to incur costs and risks that may distract management from effectively operating our North American business, and such operations or joint ventures may not be profitable. We maintain foreign operations in Canada, China, and Mexico. International operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business in, and with, foreign countries, including price controls, exchange controls, export controls, economic sanctions, duties, tariffs, limitations on participation in local enterprises, nationalization, expropriation and other governmental action, and changes in currency exchange rates. In addition, we may be subject to business disruptions created by health crises and outbreaks of communicable diseases. While we believe that our current arrangements with local partners provide us with experienced business partners in foreign countries, events or issues, including disagreements with our partners, may occur that require attention of our senior executives and may result in expenses or losses that erode the profitability of our foreign operations or cause our capital investments abroad to be unprofitable. We may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations in the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar, the Chinese renminbi, and the Hong Kong dollar. We have significant operations in Canada which incur the majority of their metal supply costs in U.S. dollars but earn the majority of their sales in Canadian dollars. Additionally, we have significant assets in China. We may from time to time experience losses when the value of the U.S. dollar strengthens against the Canadian dollar, the Chinese renminbi, or the Hong Kong dollar, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, we are subject to translation risk when we consolidate our Canadian and Chinese subsidiaries’ net assets into our balance sheet. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, or the Hong Kong dollar could reduce the value of these assets as reported in our financial statements, which could, as a result, reduce our stockholders’ equity.The Chinese government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities, particularly with regards to the land our facilities are located on. The Chinese government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property, and other matters. We believe that our operations in China are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations. 17 Moreover, the Chinese court system does not provide the same property and contract right guarantees as do courts in the United States and, accordingly, disputes may be protracted and resolution of claims may result in significant economic loss. Additionally, there is no private ownership of land in China and all land ownership is held by the government of China, its agencies, and collectives, which issue land use rights that are generally renewable. We lease the land where our Chinese facilities are located from the Chinese government. If the Chinese government decided to terminate our land use rights agreements, our assets could become impaired and our ability to meet customer orders could be impacted. RISKS RELATED TO CYBERSECURITYDamage to our information technology infrastructure could harm our business. The unavailability of any of our computer-based systems for any significant period of time could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In particular, our ability to manage inventory levels successfully largely depends on the efficient operation of our computer hardware and software systems. We use management information systems to track inventory information at individual facilities, communicate customer information, and aggregate daily sales, margin, and promotional information. Difficulties associated with upgrades, installations of major software or hardware, and integration with new systems could have a material adverse effect on results of operations. We could be required to expend substantial resources to integrate our information systems with the systems of companies we have acquired. The integration of these systems may disrupt our business or lead to operating inefficiencies. In addition, these systems are vulnerable to, among other things, damage or interruption from fire, flood, tornado, and other natural disasters, power loss, computer system and network failures, operator negligence, physical and electronic loss of data, or security breaches and computer viruses. We are subject to cybersecurity risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks.We depend on the proper functioning and availability of our information technology platform, including communications and data processing systems, in operating our business. These systems include software programs that are integral to the efficient operation of our business. We have established security measures, controls, and procedures, including established recovery procedures for critical systems and business functions, to safeguard our information technology systems and to prevent unauthorized access to such systems and any data processed or stored in such systems, and we periodically evaluate and test the adequacy of such systems, measures, controls, and procedures; however, there can be no guarantee that such systems, measures, controls, and procedures will be effective. Security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of our information, litigation, and potential liability. In addition, cyber incidents that impact the availability, reliability, speed, accuracy, or other proper functioning of these systems could have a significant impact on our operations, and potentially on our results.  We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyberattacks. A significant cyber incident, including system failure, security breach, disruption by malware, or other damage could interrupt or delay our operations, result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, damage our reputation, cause a loss of customers, or give rise to monetary fines and other penalties, which could be significant.RISKS RELATED TO OPERATING OUR BUSINESSAny significant work stoppages can harm our business. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 3,700 persons in North America and 300 persons in China. Our North American workforce was comprised of approximately 1,600 office employees and approximately 2,100 plant employees. Seventeen percent of our plant employees were members of various unions, including the United Steel Workers and The International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Five renewal contracts covering 100 employees were successfully negotiated in 2021. Four contracts covering 104 employees are currently scheduled to expire in 2022.Certain employee retirement benefit plans are underfunded and the actual cost of those benefits could exceed current estimates, which would require us to fund the shortfall. As of December 31, 2021, our pension plan had an unfunded liability of $96 million. Our actual costs for benefits required to be paid may exceed those projected and future actuarial assessments to the extent that those costs exceed the current assessment. Under those circumstances, the adjustments required to be made to our recorded liability for these benefits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and cash payments to fund these plans could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows. We may be required to make substantial future contributions to improve the plan’s funded status. 18 Any prolonged disruption of our processing centers could harm our business. We have dedicated processing centers that permit us to produce standardized products in large volumes while maintaining low operating costs. We may suffer prolonged disruption in the operations of any of these facilities, whether due to labor or technical difficulties, destruction, or damage to any of the facilities or otherwise, which could adversely affect our operating results. If we are unable to retain, attract, and motivate management and key personnel, it may adversely affect our business. In order to compete and have continued growth, we must attract, retain, and motivate executives and other key employees, including those in managerial, technical, sales, marketing, and support positions. We believe that our success is due, in part, to our experienced management team. Losing the services of one or more members of our management team such as our CEO, Edward J. Lehner, could adversely affect our business and possibly prevent us from improving our operational, financial, and information management systems and controls. We compete to hire employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies. In the future, we may need to retain and hire additional qualified sales, marketing, administrative, operating, and technical personnel, and to train and manage new personnel. Our ability to implement our business plan is dependent on our ability to retain, hire, and train a large number of qualified employees each year. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover, or increased employee benefit costs.Our risk management strategies may result in losses. From time to time, we may use fixed-price and/or fixed-volume supplier contracts to offset contracts with customers. Some of our existing supply agreements have required minimum purchase quantities. Under adverse economic conditions, those minimums may exceed our needs. Absent exceptions for force majeure and other circumstances affecting the legal enforceability of the agreements, these minimum purchase requirements may compel us to purchase quantities of raw materials that could significantly exceed our anticipated needs or pay damages to the supplier for shortfalls. In these circumstances, we would attempt to negotiate agreements for new purchase quantities. There is a risk, however, that we would not be successful in reducing purchase quantities, either through negotiation or litigation. If that occurred, we would likely be required to purchase more of a particular raw material in a particular year than we need, negatively affecting our results of operations and cash flows.Additionally, we may use commodity contracts, foreign exchange contracts, and interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk, and interest rate risk. These risk management strategies pose certain risks, including the risk that losses on a hedge position may exceed the amount invested in such instruments. Moreover, a party in a hedging transaction may be unavailable or unwilling to settle our obligations, which could cause us to suffer corresponding losses. A hedging instrument may not be effective in eliminating all of the risks inherent in any particular position. Our profitability may be adversely affected during any period as a result of the use of such instruments.RISKS RELATED TO REGULATORY AND LEGAL MATTERSWe could incur substantial costs related to environmental, health, and safety laws. Our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental, health, and safety laws. These include laws that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and establish standards for the treatment, storage, and disposal of regulated materials, and the investigation and remediation of contaminated soil, surface water, and groundwater. Failure to maintain or achieve compliance with these laws or with the permits required for our operations could result in substantial increases in operating costs and capital expenditures. In addition, we may be subject to fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third party claims for property damage or personal injury, worker’s compensation or personal injury claims, cleanup costs, or temporary or permanent discontinuance of operations. Certain of our facilities are located in industrial areas, have a history of heavy industrial use, and have been in operation for many years and, over time, we and other predecessor operators of these facilities have generated, used, handled, and disposed of hazardous and other regulated wastes. Environmental liabilities could exist, including cleanup obligations at these facilities or at off-site locations where materials from our operations were disposed of, which could result in future expenditures that cannot be currently quantified and which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Such liabilities may be imposed without regard to fault or the legality of a party’s conduct and may, in certain circumstances, be joint and several. Future changes to environmental, health, and safety laws, including those related to climate change, could result in material liabilities and costs, constrain operations, or make such operations more costly for us, our suppliers, and our customers. In October 2011, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) named JT Ryerson as one of more than 100 businesses that may be a potentially responsible party for the Portland Harbor Superfund Site. See Note 13: Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report on Form 10-K. As the EPA has not yet allocated responsibility for the contamination among the potentially responsible parties, including JT Ryerson, we do not currently have sufficient information available to us to determine whether the Record of Decision will be executed 19 as currently stated, whether and to what extent JT Ryerson may be held responsible for any of the identified contamination, and how much (if any) of the final plan’s costs might ultimately be allocated to JT Ryerson. Therefore, management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or estimate a range of potential loss at this time.Regulations related to conflict-free minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and place us at a competitive disadvantage. On August 22, 2012, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), the SEC adopted new requirements for reporting companies that use certain minerals and metals, known as “conflict minerals”, in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. These requirements require companies to diligence, disclose, and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to conclusively verify the origins for all metals used in our products and we may face reputational challenges with our customers. Additionally, as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering “conflict free” metals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary metals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Accordingly, we could incur significant costs related to the compliance process, including potential difficulty or added costs in satisfying the disclosure requirements. Moreover, we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.Tax changes could affect our effective tax rate, the value of our deferred tax assets, and future profitability.Our future results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate or changes in the treatment of deferred tax assets as a result of changes in Ryerson’s overall profitability, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax legislation, the results of the examination of previously filed tax returns, and continuing assessment of the Company’s tax exposures. In particular, although the passage of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 reduced the U.S. tax rate to 21%, our future earnings could be negatively impacted by changes in tax legislation including changing tax rates and tax base such as limiting, phasing-out, or eliminating deductions or tax credits, changing rules for earnings repatriations, and changing other tax laws in the U.S. or other countries. We are subject to litigation that could strain our resources and distract management. From time to time, we are involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, and other disputes arising in the ordinary course of business. These suits concern issues including product liability, contract disputes, employee-related matters, and personal injury matters. It is not feasible to predict the outcome of all pending suits and claims, and the ultimate resolution of these matters as well as future lawsuits that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or reputation. We may face product liability claims that are costly and create adverse publicity. If any of the products that we sell cause harm to any of our customers, we could be exposed to product liability lawsuits. If we were found liable under product liability claims, we could be required to pay substantial monetary damages. Further, even if we successfully defended ourselves against this type of claim, we could be forced to spend a substantial amount of money in litigation expenses, our management could be required to spend valuable time in the defense against these claims, and our reputation could suffer.  Changes in the method of determining the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest rates on our outstanding variable rate indebtedness.Certain of our variable rate debt, including the Ryerson Credit Facility, currently uses LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing certain interest rates. LIBOR is the subject of recent proposals for reform, and on July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. In March 2021, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority confirmed its intention to cease publication of the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR tenors and all tenors for EUR, CHF, JPY, and GBP LIBOR after December 31, 2021 and to cease publication of all other USD LIBOR after June 30, 2023. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, which was convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as the recommended risk-free alternative rate for USD LIBOR. On June 30, 2023, when LIBOR rates cease to be published, the interest rate on the Ryerson Credit Facility will be replaced with SOFR. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect any discontinuance, modification, or other reforms to LIBOR, or the establishment of alternative reference rates such as SOFR, or any other reference rate, will have on the Company or its borrowing costs. The consequences of these developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted but may result in an increase in the interest cost of our variable rate indebtedness. In addition, the overall financial market may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Disruption in the financial market could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. 20 RISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCKThe market price for our common stock may be volatile.Historically, there has been volatility in the market price for our common stock. Furthermore, the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in the future in response to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the risk factors described herein. Examples include: •changes in commodity prices, especially metals; •announcement of our quarterly operating results or the operating results of other metals service centers;  •changes in financial estimates or recommendations by stock market analysts regarding us or our competitors; •the operating and stock performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable; •press releases, earnings releases, or publicity relating to us or our competitors or relating to trends in the metals service center industry; •inability to meet securities analysts’ and investors’ quarterly or annual estimates or targets of our performance; •sales of our common stock by large or controlling shareholders; •the amount of shares acquired for short-term investments; •general domestic or international economic, market, and political conditions; and •announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, dispositions or joint ventures, or other material events impacting the domestic or global metals industry.In the past, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their specific operating performance. These factors may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of actual operating performance.In addition, stock markets from time to time experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. In the past, some shareholders have brought securities class action lawsuits against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. In the future we may be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation, regardless of whether our defense is ultimately successful, could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources.We paid cash dividends on our common stock in the third and fourth quarter of 2021 but any future dividend payments are at the discretion of our Board of Directors.The amounts that may be available to us to pay cash dividends are restricted under our debt agreements. Any payment of cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, future prospects, contractual restrictions, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Therefore, you should not rely on dividend income from shares of our common stock. For more information, see “Dividend Policy.” Your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in us may be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and you sell your shares at a profit, but there is no guarantee that the market price for our common stock will ever exceed the price that you pay for our common stock.21 Our corporate documents and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of the Company.Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our Board of Directors. These provisions: •establish a classified Board of Directors so that not all members of our Board of Directors are elected at one time; •authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock; •provide that the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our amended and restated bylaws; •prohibit stockholders from acting by written consent if less than a majority of the voting power of our outstanding stock is controlled by Platinum; and •establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.Any issuance of preferred stock could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our common stock, which could depress the price of our common stock.Our Board of Directors will have the authority to issue preferred stock and to determine the preferences, limitations, and relative rights of shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Our preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend, and other rights superior to the rights of our common stock. The potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of us, discouraging bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price, and adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.RISKS RELATED TO OUR CAPITAL STRUCTUREWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations. We currently have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2021, our total indebtedness was $639.3 million and we had approximately $670 million of unused capacity under the Ryerson Credit Facility. Our substantial indebtedness may:  •make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our outstanding notes and our other indebtedness;  •limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes;  •limit our ability to use our cash flow for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes;  •require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;  •limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;  •place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and  •increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of the Ryerson Credit Facility and the indenture governing our outstanding notes restrict but do not prohibit us from doing so, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify. 22 The covenants in the Ryerson Credit Facility and the indenture governing our notes impose, and covenants contained in agreements governing indebtedness that we incur in the future may impose, restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility. The Ryerson Credit Facility and the indenture governing our outstanding notes contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries, including JT Ryerson, to:  •incur additional debt;  •pay dividends on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock;  •make certain investments or other restricted payments;  •create liens or use assets as security in other transactions;  •merge, consolidate, transfer, or dispose of substantially all of our assets; and  •engage in transactions with affiliates. The terms of the Ryerson Credit Facility require that, in the event availability under the facility declines to a certain level, we maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter. Total credit availability is limited by the amount of eligible accounts receivable, inventory, and qualified cash pledged as collateral under the agreement insofar as the Company is subject to a borrowing base comprised of the aggregate of these three amounts, less applicable reserves. As of December 31, 2021, total credit availability under the Ryerson Credit Facility was $670 million. See discussion regarding the Ryerson Credit Facility in Note 10: “Debt” of Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” as well as the discussion within the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”Additionally, subject to certain exceptions, the indenture governing the outstanding notes restricts JT Ryerson’s ability to pay Ryerson Holding dividends. Our future indebtedness may contain covenants more restrictive in certain respects than the restrictions contained in the Ryerson Credit Facility and the indenture governing the notes. Operating results below current levels or other adverse factors, including a significant increase in interest rates, could result in our being unable to comply with financial covenants that are contained in the Ryerson Credit Facility or that may be contained in any future indebtedness. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to holders of our notes and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness. We are highly leveraged. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our outstanding notes, the Ryerson Credit Facility, and our other outstanding indebtedness are expected to account for significant cash interest expenses. Accordingly, we will have to generate significant cash flows from operations to meet our debt service requirements. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service and working capital requirements, we may be required to sell assets, seek additional capital, reduce capital expenditures, restructure or refinance all or a portion of our existing indebtedness, or seek additional financing. Moreover, insufficient cash flow may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. The right to receive payment on the 2028 Notes and the guarantees will be subordinated to the liabilities of non-guarantor subsidiaries.The notes and related guarantees are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness of our subsidiaries that are non-guarantors of the 2028 Senior Secured Notes (the “2028 Notes”). While the indenture governing the 2028 Notes limits the indebtedness and activities of these non-guarantor subsidiaries, holders of indebtedness of, and trade creditors of, non-guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under bank financing agreements, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before those assets are made available for distribution to any guarantor, as direct or indirect shareholder. While the non-guarantor subsidiaries have agreed under the indenture not to pledge or encumber their assets (other than with respect to permitted liens) without equally and ratably securing the notes, they will not guarantee the 2028 Notes notwithstanding any such pledge or encumbrance in favor of the 2028 Notes.The non-guarantor subsidiaries represented, respectively, 9.7% and 14.3% of our net sales and EBITDA for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, these non-guarantor subsidiaries represented respectively, 12.7% and 8.5% of our assets and liabilities, as of December 31, 2021.23 Accordingly, in the event that any of the non-guarantor subsidiaries or joint venture entities become insolvent, liquidates, or otherwise reorganizes: •the creditors of the guarantors (including the holders of the 2028 Notes) will have no right to proceed against such subsidiary’s assets; and  •the creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of assets of such subsidiary, as direct or indirect shareholder, and will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.Because a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain prevailing short-term interest rates, we are vulnerable to interest rate increases. A portion of our indebtedness, including the Ryerson Credit Facility, bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain short-term prevailing interest rates. As of December 31, 2021, we had $316.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Ryerson Credit Facility, with an additional $670 million available for borrowing under such facility. Assuming a consistent level of debt through-out 2021 and considering the impact of interest rate swaps, a 100 basis point increase in the interest rate on our floating rate debt effective from the beginning of the year would increase our interest expense under the Ryerson Credit Facility and the China credit facility by approximately $2.0 million, on an annual basis. If interest rates increase dramatically, we could be unable to service our debt, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Changes in our credit ratings and outlook may reduce access to capital and increase borrowing costs.Our credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and factors outside of our control, such as conditions affecting our industry generally or the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies. We cannot provide assurances that our current credit ratings will remain in effect or that the ratings will not be lowered, suspended, or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies. If rating agencies lower, suspend, or withdraw the ratings, the market price or marketability of our securities may be adversely affected. In addition, any negative change in ratings could make it more difficult for us to raise capital on acceptable terms, impact the ability to obtain adequate financing, and result in higher interest costs for our existing credit facilities, including the Ryerson Credit Facility, or on future financings.RISKS RELATED TO OUR STOCKHOLDER BASEPlatinum owns a significant percentage of our stock and has the right to nominate a majority of the members of the Corporation’s board and will be able to exert control over matters subject to stockholder approval.Platinum owns approximately 21,037,500 shares of our common stock, which is approximately 55% of our issued and outstanding common stock. Therefore, Platinum may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, Platinum may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that our stockholders may believe are in their best interest as stockholders.The Company is party to an investor rights agreement (the “Investor Rights Agreement”) with certain affiliates of Platinum which provides, among other things, that for so long as Platinum collectively beneficially owns (i) at least 30% of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the Company, Platinum will have the right to nominate for election to the board of directors of the Company no fewer than that number of directors that would constitute a majority of the number of directors if there were no vacancies on the board, (ii) at least 15% but less than 30% of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the Company, Platinum will have the right to nominate two directors, and (iii) at least 5% but less than 15% of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the Company, Platinum will have the right to nominate one director. The agreement also provides that if the size of the board of directors is increased or decreased at any time, Platinum’s nomination rights will be proportionately increased or decreased, respectively, rounded up to the nearest whole number. As a result of Platinum’s ownership of a majority of the Company’s outstanding capital stock as well its board nomination rights pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, Platinum may significantly influence or effectively control our policies and operations, including the appointment of management, future issuances of our common stock or other securities, and the payment of dividends. In addition, Platinum has significant control over our decisions to enter into any other corporate transaction. The interests of Platinum may not in all cases be aligned with the interests of the other holders of our common stock. For example, a sale of a substantial number of shares of stock in the future by Platinum could cause our stock price to decline. Further, Platinum could cause us to make acquisitions that increase the amount of the indebtedness that is secured or senior to the Company’s existing debt or sell revenue-generating assets, impairing our ability to make payments under such debt. Additionally, Platinum is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete 24 directly or indirectly with us. Accordingly, Platinum may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, Platinum may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to holders of our common stock"

Ryerson Holding Corporation (“Ryerson Holding”), a Delaware corporation, is the parent company of Joseph T. Ryerson & Son, Inc. (“JT Ryerson”), a Delaware corporation. Affiliates of Platinum Equity, LLC (“Platinum”) own approximately 21,037,500 shares of our common stock, which is approximately 55% of our issued and outstanding common stock. We are a leading metals service center, value-added processor, and distributor of industrial metals with operations in the United States through JT Ryerson, in Canada through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Ryerson Canada, Inc., a Canadian corporation (“Ryerson Canada”), and in Mexico through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Ryerson Metals de Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V., a Mexican corporation (“Ryerson Mexico”). In addition to our North American operations, we conduct processing and distribution operations in China through an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Ryerson China Limited (“Ryerson China”), a Chinese limited liability company. Unless the context indicates otherwise, Ryerson Holding, JT Ryerson, Ryerson Canada, Ryerson China, and Ryerson Mexico together with their subsidiaries, are collectively referred to herein as “Ryerson,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company.” Our Company We are one of the largest value-add processors and distributors of industrial metals in North America measured in terms of sales. We have approximately 3,900 employees across 93 facilities in North America and four facilities in China. Through this network we serve approximately 40,000 customers across a wide range of manufacturing end-markets. Our customers range from local, independently owned fabricators and machine shops to large, international original equipment manufacturers. We carry a full line of nearly 75,000 products in stainless steel, aluminum, carbon steel, and alloy steels and a limited line of nickel and red metals in various shapes and forms. In addition to our metals products, we offer numerous value-added processing and fabrication services, and more than 75% of the products we sell are processed to meet customer requirements.  Our business strategy includes providing a superior level of customer service and responsiveness, technical services, and inventory management solutions while maintaining low operating costs in order to maximize financial results. Our growth strategy is based on increasing our operating results through organic growth activities and strategic acquisitions.  To that end, we continue to focus on our interconnected network, systems, and to enhance our value-added services and online presence to provide increased access, functionality, and flexibility to our customers. Our service centers are strategically located near our customers, which permits us to quickly process and deliver our products and services, often within the next day of receiving an order. We own, lease, or contract a fleet of tractors and trailers, allowing us to efficiently meet our customers’ delivery demands. Our range of products together with our breadth of services allows us to service a diverse customer base and to create long-term partnerships with our customers and enhances our profitability. We focus on strategic acquisitions that complement and enhance our product, customer, and geographic diversification. On July 2, 2018, JT Ryerson acquired Central Steel and Wire Company (“CS&W”), a leading metal service center with locations across the Central and Eastern United States offering a wide selection of products and capabilities, with a commercial portfolio centered on bar, tube, plate, and steel products. Since our acquisition of CS&W, we have focused on improving its operating performance through efficiencies by integrating the business into our operational model. Industry Overview Metals service centers serve as key intermediaries between metal producers and end users of metal products. They purchase in scale and sell in smaller quantities.  End-users often look for “one-stop” suppliers that offer lower order volumes, shorter lead times, more reliable delivery, and processing services. Metal producers mainly sell metals in the form of standard-sized coils, sheets, plates, structurals, bars, and tubes in large quantities, with longer lead times, and limited inventory. Metal service centers serve as key intermediaries closing the gap between metal producers’ supply and end-users’ demand. By aggregating end-users’ demand and purchasing metal in bulk to take advantage of economies of scale, metals service centers may purchase, process, and deliver metal to end‑users in a more efficient and cost‑effective manner than the end‑user may achieve by dealing directly with the primary producer. Further, specialized metals processing equipment is costly and requires high‑volume production to be cost effective. In addition, many customers are not able or willing to invest in the necessary technology, equipment, and warehousing of inventory to efficiently and effectively perform metal processing for their own operations.  Due to this, many customers have reduced their in-house processing capabilities, opting to source processed metal from service centers like us.  This saves our customers time, labor, and expense, reducing their overall manufacturing costs, while permitting us to focus on value-added 4 services and increasing our fabrication mix. This supports our capital expenditures on processing equipment to grow annual gross profit margin. Our industry is highly fragmented with the largest companies accounting for only a small percentage of total market share. The majority of metals services companies have limited product lines and inventories, with customers located in a specific geographic area. In general, competition is based on quality, service, price, and geographic proximity. We primarily compete with other metals service centers and to a lesser extent with metal producers.  The metals service center industry typically experiences cash flow trends that are counter-cyclical to the revenue and volume growth of the industry. During an industry downturn, companies generally reduce working capital assets and generate cash as inventory and accounts receivable balances decline. As a result, operating cash flow and liquidity tend to increase during a downturn, which typically facilitates industry participants’ ability to cover fixed costs and repay outstanding debt. Competitive Strengths Leading Market Position in North America. Based on sales, we believe we are one of the largest service center companies for carbon, stainless steel, and aluminum in the North American market where we have a broad geographic presence with 93 facilities. Our service centers are located near our customer locations, enabling us to provide timely delivery to customers across numerous geographic markets. Additionally, our widespread network of locations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico helps us to utilize our expertise to more efficiently serve customers with complex supply chain requirements across multiple manufacturing locations. We believe this is a key differentiator for customers who need a supplier that can reliably and consistently support them. Our ability to transfer inventory among our facilities better enables us to more timely and profitably source and process specialized items at regional locations throughout our network than if we were required to maintain inventory of all products and specialized equipment at each location. Broad Geographic Reach Across Attractive End Markets. Our operations serve a diverse range of industries including commercial ground transportation, metal fabrication and machine shops, industrial machinery and equipment manufacturing, consumer durable equipment, HVAC manufacturing, construction equipment manufacturing, food processing and agricultural equipment manufacturing, and oil and gas. We believe this broad range of industries in which we sell our products and services reduces our risk related to a downturn in a specific industry. We believe that our ability to quickly adjust our offering based on regional and industry specific trends creates stability while also providing the opportunity to access specific growth markets. Established Platform for Organic and Acquisition Growth. Our growth strategy is based on increasing our operating results through organic growth activities and strategic acquisitions that enhance our product, customer, and geographic diversification. Our strategies, include investing in value-added processing capabilities, analytically targeting attractive customers and end markets with our supply chain optimization service model, industry consolidation through targeted M&A, and providing customers faster and easier solutions to their metal needs, which we believe will provide us with growth opportunities. Given the highly fragmented nature of the metals service center industry, we believe there are numerous additional opportunities to acquire businesses and incorporate them into our existing infrastructure. In addition, due to our large scale and geographic reach, we believe we can improve operating performance through efficiencies by integrating acquired businesses into our operational model, thus providing greater purchasing power, improving expense and working capital management, access to additional end markets, and broadening product mix. Lean Operating Structure Providing Operating Leverage. Ryerson has demonstrated the ability to effectively manage expenses through tactical productivity and spending improvements.  In a stronger metals service center environment characterized by increases in demand and/or pricing, we believe that most additional expenses to service higher revenue and margins would come from variable expenses while further leveraging economies of scale on our existing fixed expenses. In 2020, industry volumes were negatively impacted by substantial COVID-19 pandemic-induced demand shocks. In response, we acted swiftly and decisively to reduce our expenses and succeeded in decreasing warehousing, selling, general and administrative expenses by $82.5 million compared to 2019. Although the decrease in revenues ultimately outpaced the decrease in expenses, as a result of these efforts, the Company’s expenses as a percentage of sales increased by only 190 basis points year-over-year to 16.0%. 5 During the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, we continued to focus on and execute strong inventory management. While average inventory days excluding LIFO increased mid-year due to the recessed demand conditions, we responded quickly and effectively to reduce inventories in-line with the market environment. As a result, we ended the year with 74 days of inventory, down from 76 days at the end of 2019. Extensive Breadth of Products and Services for Diverse Customer Base. We believe our broad product mix and marketing approach provides customers with a “one-stop shop” solution few other metals service center companies are able to offer. We provide a broad range of processing and fabrication services to meet the needs of our approximately 40,000 customers and typically fulfill more than 1,300,000 orders per year. We provide supply chain solutions, including just-in-time delivery and value-added processing to many original equipment manufacturing customers. For the year ended December 31, 2020, no single customer, including their subcontractors, accounted for more than 5% of our sales, and our top 10 customers, including their subcontractors accounted for less than 15% of our sales. Strong Relationships with Suppliers. We are among the largest purchasers of metals in North America and have long-term relationships with many of our North American suppliers. We believe we are frequently one of the largest customers of our suppliers and that concentrating our orders among a core group of suppliers is effective for obtaining favorable pricing and service. We believe we have the opportunity to further leverage this strength through continued focus on price and volume using an analytics-driven approach to procurement. In addition, we view our strategic suppliers as supply chain partners. We focus on logistics, lead times, rolling schedules, and scrap return programs to drive value-based buying that is advantageous for us. Metals producers worldwide are consolidating, and large, geographically diversified customers, such as Ryerson, are desirable partners for these larger suppliers. Our relationships with suppliers often provide us with access to metals when supply is constrained. Through our knowledge of the global metals marketplace and capabilities of specific mills we believe we have developed an advantageous global purchasing strategy. Experienced Management Team with Deep Industry Knowledge. Our senior management team has extensive industry and operational experience and has been instrumental in optimizing and implementing our strategy over the last five years. Our senior management has an average of more than 20 years of experience in the metals or service center industries. Our CEO, Mr. Edward Lehner, who joined the Company in August 2012 as CFO and became CEO in June 2015, has nearly 30 years of experience, predominantly in the metals industry. On February 17, 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company appointed Mr. Mike Burbach as Chief Operating Officer of the Company, effective April 2, 2021. Mr. Burbach has over 37 years of experience with the Company and currently serves as the President, North-West Region of the Company. Mr. Jim Claussen, named Executive Vice President & CFO in January 2021, has 26 years of industry experience and Ms. Molly Kannan, Corporate Controller and CAO, has 12 years of industry experience. Industry Outlook The Institute for Supply Management’s Purchasing Managers’ Index (“PMI”) reported growth in the second half of 2020 with readings above 50%, indicating expansion in factory activity, after reporting severely weak demand in the months of April and May. This growth trend has continued from strong readings of 57.5 and 60.5 in November and December into 2021 with a reading of 58.7 for January. Overall, PMI has reported general economic expansion for the last three years as readings have exceeded 50% for 28 of the last 36 months. The PMI measures the economic health of the manufacturing sector and is a composite index based on five indicators: new orders, inventory levels, production, supplier deliveries, and the employment environment. PMI readings can be a good indicator of industrial activity and general economic growth. Additionally, Federal Reserve reports that the midrange change in real GDP was -2.4% for 2020, but it is forecasting real GDP growth rates of 4.2%, 3.2%, and 2.4% for 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively. Steel demand in North America is largely dependent on growth of the automotive, industrial equipment, consumer appliance, and construction end markets. One of our key end markets is the industrial equipment sector, and according to the latest Livingston Survey, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, U.S. industrial production contracted by 7.1% in 2020, affected by pandemic-induced demand shocks, but is expected to grow by 5.0% in 2021, and 3.4% in 2022. 6 China continues to be a key driver in the growth of global metals demand. According to the International Monetary Fund’s October 2020 report, China’s economic recovery is back to pre-pandemic levels has thus far been faster than expected. China’s GDP is expected to have grown by 2.3% in 2020 and is projected to grow 8.1% in 2021 and 5.5% in 2022.Products and Services We carry a full line of carbon steel, stainless steel, alloy steels, and aluminum, and a limited line of nickel and red metals. These materials are stocked in a number of shapes, including coils, sheets, rounds, hexagons, square and flat bars, plates, structurals, and tubing.We also provide a wide variety of processing services to meet our customers’ needs. Most of the products that we carry require expensive specialized equipment for material handling and processing. We believe few of our customers have the capability to process the metal into the desired sizes, forms, or finishes or they are unwilling to incur the significant capital expenditures to acquire the necessary equipment. We are growing and diversifying our product mix mainly as a result of our targeted growth strategy to provide increased levels of value-added processing services. We believe our enhanced processing capabilities will increase our ability to sell higher-margin metals processing services to a larger group of customers. We expect this, together and with our focus on maintaining pricing discipline related to our processing services, will increase our gross profit margin.We had capital expenditures of $158.3 million in the five-year period ended December 31, 2020. We are increasing our investments in processing equipment due to customers requesting higher levels of value-added processing.  We expect this to increase our profitability. We currently perform processing services on more than 75% of the materials sold by us. The following pie charts show our percentage of sales by major product lines for 2020 and 2019:  We are not dependent on any particular customer group or industry because we process and distribute a variety of metals. This diversity of product type and material reduces our exposure to fluctuations or other weaknesses in the financial or economic stability of particular customers or industries. We are also less dependent on any particular suppliers as a result of our product diversification. See pie charts showing our sales by metal consuming industry within “Customers and Markets” discussion below.Customers and Markets Our customer base is diverse, numbering approximately 40,000 in a variety of industries, including metal fabrication and machine shops, industrial machinery and equipment, commercial ground transportation, consumer durable, food processing and agricultural equipment, construction equipment, and HVAC. Although we sell directly to many large original equipment 7 manufacturers, the majority of our sales are to smaller customers, including small machine shops and fabricators, in small quantities with frequent deliveries, helping them manage their working capital and credit needs more efficiently.For the year ended December 31, 2020, no single customer, including their subcontractors, accounted for more than 5% of our sales, and our top 10 customers, including their subcontractors accounted for approximately 13% of our sales. Substantially all of our sales are attributable to our U.S. operations and substantially all of our long-lived assets are located in the United States. The following pie charts show the Company’s percentage of sales by metal consuming industry for 2020 and 2019: Our customers are primarily located throughout the United States, but we also have international customers. Most customers are located near one of our facilities, thus enabling an efficient delivery system capable of handling a high frequency of short lead time orders. We transport our products directly to customers via our in-house and dedicated truck fleet, which further supports the just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers, and via third-party trucking firms.We process our metals to specific customer orders as well as for stocking programs. Many of our larger customers commit to purchase on a regular basis at agreed upon or indexed prices for periods ranging from three to twelve months. To help mitigate price volatility risks, these price commitments are generally matched with corresponding supply arrangements, or to a lesser degree by commodity hedges. Customers notify us of specific release dates for processed products. Customers typically notify us of release dates anywhere from on a just-in-time basis to one month before the release date. Consequently, we are required to carry sufficient inventory to meet the short lead time and just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers. We also have international facilities located in Canada, Mexico, and China.  Net sales of our international locations (based on where the shipments originated) accounted for 10.9% of our consolidated 2020 net sales, or $376.9 million. See Note 13 — “Segment information” of Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further information on U.S. and foreign revenues and assets.Customer demand may change from time to time based on, among other things, general economic conditions and industry capacity. Many of the industries in which our customers compete are cyclical in nature. We believe that our various and diverse offerings, ways-to-markets, and end markets reduce the volatility of our business in the aggregate, thus somewhat reducing earnings volatility.  A portion of our customers experience seasonal slowdowns. Our sales, as measured in tonnage sold, in the months of July, November, and December traditionally have been lower than in other months because of a reduced number of shipping days and holiday or vacation closures for some customers. Consequently, our sales in the first two quarters of the year are usually higher than in the third and fourth quarters.8 Suppliers We purchase the majority of our inventories from key domestic metals suppliers. Because of our total volume of purchases and our long‑term relationships with our suppliers, we believe that we are generally able to purchase inventory at the best prices offered by our suppliers.For the year ended December 31, 2020, our top 25 suppliers, including their subcontractors, accounted for approximately 73% of our purchase dollars. We are generally able to meet our materials requirements because we use many suppliers, there is a substantial overlap of product offerings from these suppliers, and there are several other suppliers able to provide identical or similar products. While the metals producing supply base has experienced significant consolidation and supply interruptions due to tariffs under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, we believe both our size and our long-term relationships with our suppliers will continue to enable us to meet our material requirements. Sales and Marketing We maintain our own professional sales force. In addition to our office sales staff, we market and sell our products through the use of our field sales force that we believe has extensive product and customer knowledge and offers a comprehensive catalog of our products. Our office and field sales staff, which together consist of approximately 800 employees, include technical personnel. Additionally, we offer our customers the ability to purchase our products through our e-commerce website.Because our business is relationship-based, we operate under many different trade names. Businesses we acquire often have strong customer relationships and solid reputations, and we will often continue to use the acquired business name to maintain existing customer relationships.Capital Expenditures Although our 2020 capital spending was reduced in accordance with our pandemic response plan, we continued to focus on organic growth in 2020 by expanding existing facilities and adding processing equipment. See the “COVID 19” discussion within Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for further details. Investments by us in property, plant, and equipment, together with asset retirements for the five years ended December 31, 2020, excluding the initial purchase price of acquisitions are set forth below. The net capital change during such period aggregated to an increase of $65.2 million.    Additions  Retirementsor Sales  Net   (In millions) 2020 $26.0  $0.2   25.8 2019  45.8   57.5   (11.7)2018  38.4   5.5   32.9 2017  25.1   24.9   0.2 2016  23.0   5.0   18.0  The net reduction in 2019 is related to a sale lease-back transaction. See Part II, Item 8, Note 6: Leases for additional information. We currently anticipate capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, of up to approximately $40 million for 2021, much of which is related to organic growth activities comprised of maintenance, or purchases of, equipment. We expect capital expenditures will be funded from cash generated by operations and available borrowings. We will continue to evaluate and execute each growth project in light of the economic conditions and outlook at the time of investment and may significantly reduce our capital expenditures if economic conditions warrant a more conservative approach to capital allocation.Environmental, Health, and Safety Matters Our facilities and operations are subject to many foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and to health and safety. In particular, our operations are subject to extensive requirements relating to waste disposal, recycling, air and water emissions, the handling of regulated materials, remediation, underground storage tanks, asbestos-containing building materials, workplace exposure, and other matters. We believe that our operations are currently in substantial compliance with all such laws and do not presently anticipate substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future in order to meet environmental, workplace health or safety requirements, or to pay for any investigations, corrective action, or claims. However, claims, enforcement actions, or investigations regarding personal injury, property damage, or violation of environmental laws could 9 result in substantial costs to us, divert our management’s attention, and result in significant liabilities, fines, or the suspension or interruption of our facilities. We continue to analyze and implement safeguards to mitigate any environmental, health, and safety risks we may face. As a result, additional costs and liabilities may be incurred to comply with future requirements or to address newly discovered conditions, and these costs and liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. For example, there is increasing likelihood that additional regulation of greenhouse gas emissions will occur at the foreign, federal, state, and local level, which could affect us, our suppliers, and our customers. While the costs of compliance could be significant, given the uncertain outcome and timing of future action by the U.S. federal government and states on this issue, we cannot accurately predict the financial impact of future greenhouse gas regulations on our operations or our customers at this time. We do not currently anticipate any new programs disproportionately impacting us compared to our competitors. Some of the properties currently or previously owned or leased by us are located in industrial areas or have a long history of heavy industrial use. We may incur environmental liabilities with respect to these properties in the future including costs of investigations, corrective action, claims for natural resource damages, claims by third parties relating to property damages, or claims relating to contamination at sites where we have sent waste for treatment or disposal. Based on currently available information we do not expect any investigation, remediation matters, or claims related to properties presently or formerly owned, operated, or to which we have sent waste for treatment or disposal would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. In October 2011, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) named JT Ryerson as one of more than 100 businesses that may be a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) for the Portland Harbor Superfund Site (the “PHS Site”). On January 6, 2017, the EPA issued an initial Record of Decision (“ROD”) regarding the site. The ROD includes a combination of dredging, capping, and enhanced natural recovery that would take approximately thirteen years to construct plus additional time for monitored natural recovery, at an estimated present value cost of $1.05 billion. In a change from its prior stance, at a meeting on December 4, 2018, the EPA indicated that it expected PRPs to submit a plan during 2019 to start remediation of the river and harbor per the original ROD within the next two to three years. The EPA also indicated that it expected allocation of amounts among the parties to be determined in the same two to three-year time frame. The EPA invited certain PRPs to a May 2, 2019 meeting to discuss starting the remedial design process. The EPA did not include JT Ryerson in those meetings.On December 9, 2019, a PRP group met with Administrator Wheeler, the head of the EPA, to discuss updating the ROD as recent testing indicates that the levels of contamination have “drastically improved” and, thus, remediation should be much less drastic than that in the current ROD. Administrator Wheeler directed regional EPA staff to again review the ROD before moving forward with any enforcement action. On March 3, 2020, the regional EPA issued a letter to the PRP group, essentially rejecting the request but noting that new data would be used for fine-tuning the implementation of the remedy and to that extent could result in less active remediation.The EPA indicated in a January 2, 2020 “progress update” letter that it is negotiating with certain parties to perform remedial design work at five unspecified areas which comprise 52% of the overall acreage subject to remediation.  In late March 2020, the EPA issued a Unilateral Administrative Order for Remedial Design to Schnitzer Steel, ordering it to develop a remedial design plan for the river area which includes the area where our former facilities were. Schnitzer filed a petition for relief from the remedy required by the ROD as well as disclosures required by the EPA. Schnitzer’s 2020 disclosures made no mention of JT Ryerson and acknowledged that Schnitzer is the legal successor to the prior operator in the designated area.The EPA has stated that it is willing to consider de minimis settlements, which JT Ryerson is trying to pursue; however, the EPA has not begun meeting with any of the smaller parties who have requested de minimis or de micromis status, stating that it does not have sufficient information to determine whether any parties meet such criteria and does not intend to begin those considerations until after the remedial design work is completed. It has met with selected parties that we believe to be larger targets. JT Ryerson has not been invited to meet with the EPA. As a result of the ongoing negotiations and filings over the ROD and the EPA’s decision not to meet with smaller parties, we cannot determine how allocations will be made and whether a de minimus settlement can be reached with the EPA.As the EPA has not yet allocated responsibility for the contamination among the potentially responsible parties, including JT Ryerson, we do not currently have sufficient information available to us to determine whether the ROD will be executed as currently stated, whether and to what extent JT Ryerson may be held responsible for any of the identified contamination, and how much (if any) of the final plan’s costs might ultimately be allocated to JT Ryerson. Therefore, management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or estimate a range of potential loss at this time.10 There are various other claims and pending actions against the Company. The amount of liability, if any, for those claims and actions as of December 31, 2020 is not determinable but, in the opinion of management, such liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We maintain liability insurance coverage to assist in protecting our assets from losses arising from or related to activities associated with business operations.Our United States operations are also subject to the Department of Transportation Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations. We operate a private trucking motor fleet for making deliveries to some of our customers. Our drivers do not carry any material quantities of hazardous materials. Our foreign operations are subject to similar regulations. Future regulations could increase maintenance, replacement, and fuel costs for our fleet. These costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. Intellectual Property We own several U.S. and foreign trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Certain of the trademarks are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and, in certain circumstances, with the trademark offices of various foreign countries. We consider certain other information owned by us to be trade secrets. We protect our trade secrets by, among other things, entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees regarding such matters and implementing measures to restrict access to sensitive data and computer software source code on a need-to-know basis. We believe that these safeguards adequately protect our proprietary rights and we vigorously defend these rights. While we consider all our intellectual property rights as a whole to be important, we do not consider any single right to be essential to our operations as a whole. Corporate ResponsibilityRyerson is committed to operating with a high level of integrity. We are driven by our dedication to support our employees and the communities we serve, deliver products that meet our stringent quality and compliance standards, and maintain high environmental, health, and safety standards to protect our people and the places where we operate. We work to continually improve each of these areas to make Ryerson an even better company for tomorrow.Below are some highlights of our corporate responsibility programs. SustainabilityAs part of our efforts to operate with a high level of integrity, we continuously monitor and analyze ourselves and our supply-chain relationships.  We strive, and expect our suppliers, to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and Ryerson's Human Rights Policy, Conflict Minerals Policy, and Code of Ethics and Business Conduct.We are committed to mitigating the impact our operations and products have on the environment. As an operator of metals service centers, our day-to-day business consists of the sale, distribution, and processing of a broad variety of metal products sourced from numerous primary metal producers. Our operations, by their nature, do not emit significant amounts of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases. Further, according to the Steel Recycling Institute, we believe steel, one of our most significant products, is the most recycled material on the planet—more than plastic, paper, and glass combined each year—which provides a strong foundation for our sustainability efforts. The Steel Recycling Institute notes that two out of every three tons of new steel are produced from old steel. As part of our commitment to environmental sustainability, we: •purchase significant volumes of metal that have been produced using recycled materials or scrap melted in electric arc furnaces; •sell scrap material generated in our operations to recyclers; and •source most of our steel from North American metal producers, which have substantially lower greenhouse gas emissions than Chinese producers.We also use propane fuel to operate forklifts, have installed energy efficient lighting in many of our operations, and utilize energy efficient diesel tractors that consume less fuel and reduce emissions for the majority of our trucking fleet to further mitigate our impact on the environment.  11 Community RelationsWe are committed to helping build better communities in the places where we operate. We invest in the community and our people in a variety of ways, from volunteerism to providing educational resources to help our employees and families advance their careers: •Service & Giving — We support numerous charitable organizations, including those that promote good health, children's causes, educational advancement, and community programs, through volunteer efforts. We encourage our employees to give back to the communities they call home through the Ryerson Gives Back program. Employees are encouraged to volunteer their time from working in food kitchens to participating in community events and trainings. Through our employees, we are actively involved in building and supporting our local communities. Additionally, as a part of the Ryerson internship program, each group of interns develop and implement a community service project. Past intern projects have focused on waste reduction, raising money to benefit charities, feeding the homeless, and elementary education. •College Scholarship Program and Tuition Reimbursement — For decades, we have supported the continuing education of our employees’ families through a college scholarship program. In 2020, as part of this program, we awarded almost $75,000 in academic scholarships to students graduating from high school that are children or dependents of Ryerson employees. We also support the continuing education of our employees through tuition reimbursement programs.Human CapitalIn order to provide best in class customer experiences, it is crucial that we continue to attract and retain top talent. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to create a diverse, inclusive, and safe workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation, benefits, and wellness programs, and by programs that build connections between our employees and their communities. Employees. As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 3,600 persons in North America and 300 persons in China. Our North American workforce was comprised of approximately 1,600 office employees and approximately 2,000 plant employees. Eighteen percent of our plant employees were members of various unions, including the United Steel Workers and The International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Nine renewal contracts and one initial contract covering approximately 196 employees were successfully negotiated in 2020.  Six contracts covering 96 employees are currently scheduled to expire in 2021.Employee Development. Ryerson believes in promoting from within and provides the resources for long-term career development.  Our summer internship program and Ryerson Academy provide meaningful training to entry-level employees.  Ryerson Academy is a unique, 12-month immersive training program for entry-level inside sales associates. The program provides intensive training and experience in sales and customer service for approximately 20 new hires and entry-level employees each year.  Ryerson Academy also teaches critical communication, negotiation, and presentation skills, and participants regularly interact with Ryerson’s senior leadership and subject matter experts.  We have a robust training platform, Ryerson EDvantage, available to all employees which offers Ryerson product training along with general skills courses that are customized for our employees’ development.  We focus on succession planning and ensure that proper cross-training and knowledge transfer is in place.  Our average employee tenure is 12 years, and our voluntary turnover rate in 2020 was less than 7 percent.  Diversity and Inclusion. Ryerson is dedicated to building a diverse workplace of associates from a variety of cultures, educational backgrounds, and life experiences. A well-rounded community of talent helps cultivate new ideas and perspectives that help the Company expand its thinking and refine its practices and processes to continue growing in a smart way. Ryerson is aggressively working to engage diverse and under-represented individuals through its recruiting efforts in diverse and underserved communities. We have a Diversity & Inclusion Council that works across the Company to increase the number of minorities and women in positions of increased responsibility and leadership, to identify opportunities for the organization to engage with its broader communities to promote equity, social justice, and inclusion, and to sponsor additional employee resource groups dedicated to driving diversity, equity and inclusion.  We promote the advancement of women in our organization through our Women’s Sponsorship Program which provides sponsorship of women in various levels and positions throughout the organization.  From a governance perspective, our Board of Directors and Compensation Committee provides oversight of our policies, programs, and initiatives focusing on workforce diversity and inclusion.Employee Safety.  Upholding a safe workplace is one of our core values and a part of the company's culture. Our safety standards, which go beyond the minimum requirements required by applicable law, have helped protect the well-being of our people and prevent workplace injuries that can impact business productivity. We continuously work to maintain a safety performance rating that outperforms the industry average and have implemented an Environmental, Health, and Safety policy that reinforces the goal of a 12 zero-injury workplace. Our low recordable injury rate compared to our peers in the metal services industry, based on U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) criteria, reflects our effectiveness in protecting our employees. Our 2020 performance at our facilities, measured as the number of OSHA recordable injuries per 200,000 labor hours, was 1.85, which was almost two times better than the industry average as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Please refer to the section titled “COVID-19” of Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations” for further information on the health and wellness actions taken in response to COVID-19.Health and Wellness. The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and convenient health and wellness programs, including benefits that provide protection and security so they can have peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or that impact their financial well-being; that support their physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status, and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors; and that offer choice where possible so they can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interests of our employees and the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations, such as having office employees work from home and implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work.Compensation and Benefits. We provide robust compensation and benefits programs to help meet the financial needs of our employees. In addition to salaries, we provide annual and quarterly sales incentive plans, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, retirement savings contribution matching, paid time off, family leave, employee assistance programs, and tuition assistance. Additionally, we have targeted equity-based grant programs with vesting conditions to facilitate retention of personnel, particularly those with critical skills and experience.Available Information All periodic and current reports and other filings that we are required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are available free of charge from the SEC’s website (www.sec.gov) or through our Investor Relations website at http://ir.ryerson.com.

Our website and the information contained therein or connected thereto are not incorporated into this annual report on Form 10-K. ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS. Our business faces many risks. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the other information in this report, including the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors below will not occur. These risks could have a material and adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. RISKS RELATED TO THE CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) PANDEMIC The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. The global outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and a national emergency by the U.S. government in March 2020 and has negatively affected the U.S. and global economies, disrupted global supply chains, resulted in significant travel and transport restrictions, mandated closures and stay-at-home orders, and created significant disruptions in the financial markets. We continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across our business.  The global spread of COVID-19, and the various governmental, industry, and consumer actions related thereto, have had, and are expected to continue to have negative impacts on our business and operations, including softening demand for our products, 13 disruptions in our supply chain and operations, and related restrictions on our employees, including quarantines, stay-at-home orders, and restrictions on travel.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented several policies and procedures to protect the health and welfare of our employees first and foremost, while operating as an essential business, and maintaining our liquidity. We have communicated and enforced social distancing practices by alternating employee shifts, eliminating congregation, suspending non-essential travel, and by implementing work from home arrangements for those employees able to work remotely. COVID-19 has disrupted our internal operations, including by heightening the risk that our employees will suffer illness or otherwise not be permitted to work and exposing us to cybersecurity and other risks associated with a large number of our employees working remotely. In 2020, certain of our facilities have experienced temporary work disruptions as a result of COVID-19, and we cannot predict whether these will continue or if our facilities will experience more significant or frequent disruptions in the future. Furthermore, we have and may need to further reduce our workforce as a result of declines in our business caused by COVID-19, and any such reduction would cause us to incur costs. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we would be able to rehire our workforce in the event our business experiences a subsequent recovery.On the whole, because manufacturing demand is tied closely to overall economic strength, economic uncertainty and/or increased unemployment that results from the COVID-19 pandemic or measures undertaken in response have led and could continue to lead to lower demand for our products. Although our end-markets are diverse, concerns regarding and measures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have and could further negatively influence overall demand, particularly for the consumer durable sector, resulting in cancellations or deferrals of orders and/or decreases in new deliveries.COVID-19 has also led to disruption and volatility in the capital markets, which depending on future developments could adversely impact our capital resources and liquidity in the future. We are also monitoring the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the fair value of our assets. While we do not currently anticipate any material impairments of our assets as a result of COVID-19, future changes in expectations for sales, earnings, and cash flows related to intangible assets and goodwill below our current projections could cause these assets to be impaired.We are continuing to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across our business and will take appropriate actions in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken in response thereto  adversely impacts our business, financial condition, and results of operations will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments, which are highly uncertain, rapidly changing, and cannot be predicted, including: the duration and scope of the outbreak; governmental, business, and individual actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the outbreak, including travel restrictions, quarantines, social distancing, vaccine rollouts, work-at-home and stay-at-home orders; the impact of the outbreak on the financial markets and economic activity generally; the effect of the outbreak on our customers, suppliers, and other business partners; our ability to access usual sources of liquidity on reasonable terms; and our ability to comply with the financial covenants in our $1 billion revolving credit facility (the “Ryerson Credit Facility”) if a material economic downturn results in increased indebtedness or substantially lower EBITDA.  All of the foregoing will likely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and forward-looking expectations.The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate the other risks discussed in this Form 10-K and in other filings we make from time to time with the SEC.RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRYWeakness in the economy, market trends, and other conditions affecting the profitability and financial stability of our customers could negatively impact our sales growth and results of operations. Economic and industry trends affect our business environments. We serve several metals-consuming industries in which the demand for our products and services is sensitive to the production activity, capital spending, and demand for products and services of our customers. Many of these customers operate in markets that are subject to highly cyclical fluctuations resulting from seasonality, market uncertainty, costs of goods sold, currency exchange rates, foreign competition, offshoring of production, oil and natural gas prices, geopolitical developments, and a variety of other factors beyond our control. Any of these factors could cause customers to idle or close facilities, delay purchases, reduce production levels, or experience reductions in the demand for their own products or services.Any of these events could impair the ability of our customers to make full and timely payments or reduce the volume of products and services these customers purchase from us and could cause increased pressure on our selling prices and terms of sale. We do not expect the cyclical nature of our industry to change and any downturn in our customers’ industries could reduce our revenues and profitability or a significant or prolonged slowdown in activity in the United States (U.S.), Canada, or any other major world economy, or a segment of any such economy, could negatively impact our sales growth and results of operations.14 The metals services business is very competitive and increased competition could reduce our revenues and gross margins. We face competition in all markets we serve, from metals producers that sell directly to certain customers or segments of the market, to other metal services companies.  The metals services industry itself is highly fragmented and competitive. There are a few large competitors, but most of the market is served by small local and regional competitors. Competition is based principally on price, service, quality, production capabilities, inventory availability, and timely delivery. We are experiencing increased pressure from online businesses that compete with price transparency. We expect technological advancements and the increased use of e-commerce solutions within the industry to continue to evolve at a rapid pace. As a result, our ability to effectively compete requires us to respond and adapt to new industry trends and developments, and implement new technology and innovations that may result in unexpected costs or may take longer than expected. To remain competitive, we must be willing and able to respond to market pressures. These pressures, and the implementation, timing, and results of our strategic pricing and other responses, could have a material effect on our sales and profitability. If we are unable to grow sales or reduce costs, among other actions, to wholly or partially offset the effect on profitability of our pricing actions, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.  Changing metals prices may have a significant impact on our liquidity, net sales, gross margins, operating income, and net income. The metals services industry as a whole is cyclical and, at times, pricing and availability of metal can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control, including general domestic and international economic conditions, labor costs, sales levels, competition, levels of inventory held by other metals service centers, consolidation of metals producers, higher raw material costs for the producers of metals, import duties and tariffs, and currency exchange rates. This volatility can significantly affect the availability and cost of materials for us.  Our ability to pass on increases in costs in a timely manner depends on market conditions and may result in lower gross margins. In addition, higher prices could impact demand for these products, resulting in lower sales volumes. Moreover, we maintain substantial inventories of metal to accommodate the short lead times and just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers. Accordingly, we purchase metals in an effort to maintain inventory at levels that we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon historic buying practices, contracts with customers, and market conditions. Commitments for metal purchases are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time orders are placed or at the time of shipment. During periods of rising metal prices, we may be negatively impacted by delays between the time of increases in the cost of metals to us and increases in the prices that we charge for our products if we are unable to pass these increased costs on to our customers. In addition, when metal prices decline, this could result in lower selling prices for our products and, as we use existing inventory that we purchased at higher metal prices, lower gross profit margins. Declines in prices or further reductions in sales volumes could adversely impact our ability to maintain our liquidity and to remain in compliance with certain financial covenants under our Ryerson Credit Facility, as well as result in us incurring inventory or goodwill impairment charges. Consequently, changing metals prices could significantly impact our liquidity, net sales, gross margins, operating income, and net income. Unexpected product shortages could negatively impact customer relationships, resulting in an adverse impact on results of operations. Disruptions could occur due to factors beyond our control, including economic downturns, political unrest, port slowdowns, trade issues, including increased export or import duties or trade restrictions, health crises, and other factors, any of which could adversely affect a supplier’s ability to manufacture or deliver products to us. Public health problems may result in quarantines, business closures, transportation restrictions, import and export complications, and otherwise cause shortages in the supply of materials, higher costs for available supplies, or cause other disruptions within our operations and supply chain. Public health problems currently cause and may continue to cause increased costs of certain supplies and disruptions and delays within our supply chain, and public health problems may expose us to unanticipated liability or require us to change our business practices. Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in shipments of products or difficulties in obtaining products, any of which may expose us to unanticipated liability or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For our sources of lower cost products from Asia and other areas of the world, the effect of disruptions is typically increased due to the additional lead time required and distances involved.  Further, the risk of disruption is increased due to the current political climate seeking trade reform. In addition, we have strategic relationships with a number of vendors. In the event we are unable to maintain those relations, there might be a loss of competitive pricing advantages which could, in turn, adversely affect results of operations.Changes in customer or product mix could cause the gross margin percentage to decline. From time to time, we experience changes in customer and product mix that affect gross margin. Changes in customer and product mix result primarily from business acquisitions, changes in customer demand, customer acquisitions, selling and marketing 15 activities, and competition. If rapid growth with lower margin customers occurs, we will face pressure to maintain current gross margins, as these customers receive more discounted pricing due to their higher sales volume. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain historical gross margins in the future.We may not be able to retain or expand our customer base if the North American manufacturing industry continues to erode through moving offshore or through acquisition and merger or consolidation activity in our customers’ industries. Our customer base primarily includes manufacturing and industrial firms. Some of our customers operate in industries that are undergoing consolidation through acquisition and merger activity; some are considering or have considered relocating production operations overseas or outsourcing particular functions overseas; and some customers have closed as they were unable to compete successfully with overseas competitors. Our facilities are predominately located in the United States and Canada. To the extent that our customers cease U.S. operations, relocate, or move operations overseas to regions in which we do not have a presence, we could lose their business. Acquirers of manufacturing and industrial firms may have suppliers of choice that do not include us, which could impact our customer base and market share. Global metal overcapacity and imports of metal products into the United States have adversely affected, and may again adversely affect, United States metal prices, which could impact our sales and results of operations.At times, global metal production capacity may exceed global consumption of metal products. Such excess capacity sometimes results in metal manufacturers in certain countries exporting steel at prices that are lower than prevailing domestic prices and sometimes at or below their cost of production. Excessive imports of metal into the United States, such as in recent years, have exerted and may exert in the future, downward pressure on United States steel prices which may negatively affect our results of operations.The U.S. government enacted several trade actions in 2018 and 2019 including tariffs on imported steel and aluminum products under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. It is expected that these trade actions, while in effect, will limit metal imports from nonexempt countries. If these trade actions are relaxed, repealed, or if relatively higher U.S. metal prices make it attractive for foreign metal producers to export their products to the U.S., despite the presence of duties or tariffs, the resurgence of substantial imports of foreign steel could create downward pressure on U.S. metal prices which could have a material adverse effect on sales prices and future results of operations. To the extent these tariffs and other trade actions result in a decrease in demand for steel and aluminum, or products manufactured therefrom and, produced in the United States, or otherwise negatively impact demand for our products, our business may be adversely impacted. Lead time and the cost of our products could increase if we were to lose one of our primary suppliers. If, for any reason, our primary suppliers of aluminum, carbon steel, stainless steel, or other metals should curtail or discontinue their delivery of such metals in the quantities needed and at prices that are competitive, our business could suffer. The number of available suppliers could be reduced by factors such as industry consolidation and bankruptcies affecting steel and metal producers. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our top 25 suppliers represented approximately 73% of our purchases. We could be significantly and adversely affected if delivery were disrupted from a major supplier. If, in the future, we were unable to obtain sufficient amounts of the necessary metals at competitive prices and on a timely basis from our traditional suppliers, we may not be able to obtain such metals from alternative sources at competitive prices to meet our delivery schedules, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. RISKS RELATED TO MARKET AND ECONOMIC VOLATILITYChanges in inflation may adversely affect gross margins. Inflation impacts the costs at which we can procure product and the ability to increase prices to customers over time. Prolonged periods of deflation could adversely affect the degree to which we are able to increase sales through price increases.The volatility of the market could result in a material impairment of goodwill. We evaluate goodwill annually on October 1 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment. Events or changes in circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to our historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner or the use of our assets or the strategy for our overall business, and significant negative industry or economic trends. We test for impairment of goodwill by assessing various qualitative factors with respect to development in our business and the overall economy and calculating the fair value of a reporting unit using a combination of an income approach based on discounted future cash flows and a market approach at the date of valuation, as necessary. Under the discounted cash flow method, the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated based on expected future 16 economic benefits discounted to a present value at a rate of return commensurate with the risk associated with the investment. Projected cash flows are discounted to present value using an estimated weighted average cost of capital, which considers both returns to equity and debt investors. Please refer to the Section titled “Critical Accounting Estimates - Goodwill,” of Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations,” and Note 1 — “Summary of Accounting and Financial Policies” of Part II, Item 8 ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" for further information.Poor investment performance or other factors could require us to make significant unplanned contributions to our pension plan and future funding for postretirement employee benefits other than pensions also may require substantial payments from current cash flow. We provide defined benefit pension plans for certain eligible employees and retirees. The performance of the debt and equity markets affect the value of plan assets. A decline in the market value may increase the funding requirements for these plans. The cost of providing pension benefits is also affected by other factors, including interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels, the rate of return on plan assets, discount rates used in determining future benefit obligations, future government regulation, and prior contributions to the plans. Significant unanticipated changes in any of these factors may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. RISKS RELATED TO EXPANSION AND INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONSWe may not be able to successfully consummate and complete the integration of future acquisitions, and if we are unable to do so, it could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs and/or decreases in revenues and results of operations. We have grown through a combination of internal expansion, acquisitions, and joint ventures. We intend to continue to grow through selective acquisitions, but we may not be able to identify appropriate acquisition candidates, obtain financing on satisfactory terms, consummate acquisitions, or integrate acquired businesses effectively and profitably into our existing operations. Restrictions contained in the agreements governing our notes, the Ryerson Credit Facility, or our other existing or future debt may also inhibit our ability to make certain investments, including acquisitions, and participations in joint ventures. Acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures, and other business combination transactions, both foreign and domestic, involve various inherent risks, such as uncertainties in assessing value, strengths, weaknesses, liabilities, and potential profitability. There is also risk relating to our ability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from the transactions. Additionally, problems could arise from the integration of acquired businesses, including unanticipated changes in the business or industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition. Our future success will depend on our ability to complete the integration of these future acquisitions successfully into our operations. Specifically, after any acquisition, customers may choose to diversify their supply chains to reduce reliance on a single supplier for a portion of their metals needs. We may not be able to retain all of our and an acquisition’s customers, which may adversely affect our business and sales. Integrating acquisitions, particularly large acquisitions, requires us to enhance our operational and financial systems and employ additional qualified personnel, management, and financial resources, and may adversely affect our business by diverting management away from day-to-day operations. Further, failure to successfully integrate acquisitions may adversely affect our profitability by creating significant operating inefficiencies that could increase our operating expenses as a percentage of sales and reduce our operating income. In addition, we may not realize expected cost savings from acquisitions. Any one or more of these factors could cause us to not realize the benefits anticipated or have a negative impact on the fair value of the reporting units. Accordingly, goodwill and intangible assets recorded as a result of acquisitions could become impaired.Certain of our operations are located outside of the United States, which subjects us to risks associated with international activities. Certain of our operations are located outside of the United States, primarily in Canada, China, and Mexico. We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making corrupt payments or otherwise corruptly giving anything of value to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment, and requires companies to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices. The FCPA applies to covered companies, individual directors, officers, employees, and agents. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for some actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives. If we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA, governmental authorities in the United States could seek to impose civil and/or criminal penalties. 17 Our international operations and potential joint ventures may cause us to incur costs and risks that may distract management from effectively operating our North American business, and such operations or joint ventures may not be profitable. We maintain foreign operations in Canada, China, and Mexico. International operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business in, and with, foreign countries, including price controls, exchange controls, export controls, economic sanctions, duties, tariffs, limitations on participation in local enterprises, nationalization, expropriation and other governmental action, and changes in currency exchange rates. In addition, we may be subject to business disruptions created by health crises and outbreaks of communicable diseases, including the outbreak of COVID-19. While we believe that our current arrangements with local partners provide us with experienced business partners in foreign countries, events or issues, including disagreements with our partners, may occur that require attention of our senior executives and may result in expenses or losses that erode the profitability of our foreign operations or cause our capital investments abroad to be unprofitable. We may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations in the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar, the Chinese renminbi, and the Hong Kong dollar. We have significant operations in Canada which incur the majority of their metal supply costs in U.S. dollars but earn the majority of their sales in Canadian dollars. Additionally, we have significant assets in China. We may from time to time experience losses when the value of the U.S. dollar strengthens against the Canadian dollar, the Chinese renminbi, or the Hong Kong dollar, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, we are subject to translation risk when we consolidate our Canadian and Chinese subsidiaries’ net assets into our balance sheet. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, or the Hong Kong dollar could reduce the value of these assets as reported in our financial statements, which could, as a result, reduce our stockholders’ equity.The Chinese government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities, particularly with regards to the land our facilities are located on. The Chinese government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property, and other matters. We believe that our operations in China are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations. Moreover, the Chinese court system does not provide the same property and contract right guarantees as do courts in the United States and, accordingly, disputes may be protracted and resolution of claims may result in significant economic loss. Additionally, there is no private ownership of land in China and all land ownership is held by the government of China, its agencies, and collectives, which issue land use rights that are generally renewable. We lease the land where our Chinese facilities are located from the Chinese government. If the Chinese government decided to terminate our land use rights agreements, our assets could become impaired and our ability to meet customer orders could be impacted. RISKS RELATED TO CYBERSECURITYDamage to our information technology infrastructure could harm our business. The unavailability of any of our computer-based systems for any significant period of time could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In particular, our ability to manage inventory levels successfully largely depends on the efficient operation of our computer hardware and software systems. We use management information systems to track inventory information at individual facilities, communicate customer information, and aggregate daily sales, margin, and promotional information. Difficulties associated with upgrades, installations of major software or hardware, and integration with new systems could have a material adverse effect on results of operations. We could be required to expend substantial resources to integrate our information systems with the systems of companies we have acquired. The integration of these systems may disrupt our business or lead to operating inefficiencies. In addition, these systems are vulnerable to, among other things, damage or interruption from fire, flood, tornado, and other natural disasters, power loss, computer system and network failures, operator negligence, physical and electronic loss of data, or security breaches and computer viruses. We are subject to cybersecurity risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks.We depend on the proper functioning and availability of our information technology platform, including communications and data processing systems, in operating our business. These systems include software programs that are integral to the efficient operation of our business. We have established security measures, controls, and procedures, including established recovery procedures for 18 critical systems and business functions, to safeguard our information technology systems and to prevent unauthorized access to such systems and any data processed or stored in such systems, and we periodically evaluate and test the adequacy of such systems, measures, controls, and procedures; however, there can be no guarantee that such systems, measures, controls, and procedures will be effective. Security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of our information, litigation, and potential liability. In addition, cyber incidents that impact the availability, reliability, speed, accuracy, or other proper functioning of these systems could have a significant impact on our operations, and potentially on our results.  We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyberattacks. A significant cyber incident, including system failure, security breach, disruption by malware, or other damage could interrupt or delay our operations, result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, damage our reputation, cause a loss of customers, or give rise to monetary fines and other penalties, which could be significant.RISKS RELATED TO OPERATING OUR BUSINESSAny significant work stoppages can harm our business. As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 3,600 persons in North America and 300 persons in China. Our North American workforce was comprised of approximately 1,600 office employees and approximately 2,000 plant employees. Eighteen percent of our plant employees were members of various unions, including the United Steel Workers and The International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Nine renewal contracts and one initial contract covering approximately 196 employees were successfully negotiated in 2020.  Six contracts covering 96 employees are currently scheduled to expire in 2021.Certain employee retirement benefit plans are underfunded and the actual cost of those benefits could exceed current estimates, which would require us to fund the shortfall. As of December 31, 2020, our pension plan had an unfunded liability of $154 million. Our actual costs for benefits required to be paid may exceed those projected and future actuarial assessments to the extent that those costs exceed the current assessment. Under those circumstances, the adjustments required to be made to our recorded liability for these benefits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and cash payments to fund these plans could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows. We may be required to make substantial future contributions to improve the plan’s funded status. Any prolonged disruption of our processing centers could harm our business. We have dedicated processing centers that permit us to produce standardized products in large volumes while maintaining low operating costs. We may suffer prolonged disruption in the operations of any of these facilities, whether due to labor or technical difficulties, destruction, or damage to any of the facilities or otherwise, which could adversely affect our operating results. If we are unable to retain, attract, and motivate management and key personnel, it may adversely affect our business. In order to compete and have continued growth, we must attract, retain, and motivate executives and other key employees, including those in managerial, technical, sales, marketing, and support positions. We believe that our success is due, in part, to our experienced management team. Losing the services of one or more members of our management team such as our CEO, Edward J. Lehner, could adversely affect our business and possibly prevent us from improving our operational, financial, and information management systems and controls. We compete to hire employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies. In the future, we may need to retain and hire additional qualified sales, marketing, administrative, operating, and technical personnel, and to train and manage new personnel. Our ability to implement our business plan is dependent on our ability to retain, hire, and train a large number of qualified employees each year. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover, or increased employee benefit costs.Our risk management strategies may result in losses. From time to time, we may use fixed-price and/or fixed-volume supplier contracts to offset contracts with customers. Some of our existing supply agreements have required minimum purchase quantities. Under adverse economic conditions, those minimums may exceed our needs. Absent exceptions for force majeure and other circumstances affecting the legal enforceability of the agreements, these minimum purchase requirements may compel us to purchase quantities of raw materials that could significantly exceed our anticipated needs or pay damages to the supplier for shortfalls. In these circumstances, we would attempt to negotiate agreements for new purchase quantities. There is a risk, however, that we would not be successful in reducing purchase quantities, either through negotiation or litigation. If that occurred, we would likely be required to purchase more of a particular raw material in a particular year than we need, negatively affecting our results of operations and cash flows.19 Additionally, we may use commodity contracts, foreign exchange contracts, and interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk, and interest rate risk. These risk management strategies pose certain risks, including the risk that losses on a hedge position may exceed the amount invested in such instruments. Moreover, a party in a hedging transaction may be unavailable or unwilling to settle our obligations, which could cause us to suffer corresponding losses. A hedging instrument may not be effective in eliminating all of the risks inherent in any particular position. Our profitability may be adversely affected during any period as a result of use of such instruments.RISKS RELATED TO REGULATORY AND LEGAL MATTERSWe could incur substantial costs related to environmental, health, and safety laws. Our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental, health, and safety laws. These include laws that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and establish standards for the treatment, storage, and disposal of regulated materials, and the investigation and remediation of contaminated soil, surface water, and groundwater. Failure to maintain or achieve compliance with these laws or with the permits required for our operations could result in substantial increases in operating costs and capital expenditures. In addition, we may be subject to fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third party claims for property damage or personal injury, worker’s compensation or personal injury claims, cleanup costs, or temporary or permanent discontinuance of operations. Certain of our facilities are located in industrial areas, have a history of heavy industrial use, and have been in operation for many years and, over time, we and other predecessor operators of these facilities have generated, used, handled, and disposed of hazardous and other regulated wastes. Environmental liabilities could exist, including cleanup obligations at these facilities or at off-site locations where materials from our operations were disposed of, which could result in future expenditures that cannot be currently quantified and which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Such liabilities may be imposed without regard to fault or the legality of a party’s conduct and may, in certain circumstances, be joint and several. Future changes to environmental, health, and safety laws, including those related to climate change, could result in material liabilities and costs, constrain operations, or make such operations more costly for us, our suppliers, and our customers. In October 2011, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) named JT Ryerson as one of more than 100 businesses that may be a potentially responsible party for the Portland Harbor Superfund Site. See Item 3 “Legal Proceedings.” As the EPA has not yet allocated responsibility for the contamination among the potentially responsible parties, including JT Ryerson, we do not currently have sufficient information available to us to determine whether the Record of Decision will be executed as currently stated, whether and to what extent JT Ryerson may be held responsible for any of the identified contamination, and how much (if any) of the final plan’s costs might ultimately be allocated to JT Ryerson. Therefore, management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or estimate a range of potential loss at this time.Regulations related to conflict-free minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and place us at a competitive disadvantage. On August 22, 2012, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), the United States SEC adopted new requirements for reporting companies that use certain minerals and metals, known as “conflict minerals”, in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. These requirements require companies to diligence, disclose, and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to conclusively verify the origins for all metals used in our products and we may face reputational challenges with our customers. Additionally, as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering “conflict free” metals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary metals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Accordingly, we could incur significant cost related to the compliance process, including potential difficulty or added costs in satisfying the disclosure requirements. Moreover, we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.Tax changes could affect our effective tax rate, the value of our deferred tax assets, and future profitability.Our future results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate or changes in the treatment of deferred tax assets as a result of changes in Ryerson’s overall profitability, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax legislation, the results of the examination of previously filed tax returns, and continuing assessment of the Company’s tax exposures. In particular, although the passage of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 reduced the U.S. tax rate to 21%, our future earnings could be negatively impacted by changes in tax legislation including changing tax rates and tax base such as limiting, phasing-out, or eliminating deductions or tax credits, changing rules for earnings repatriations, and changing other tax laws in the U.S. or other countries. 20 We are subject to litigation that could strain our resources and distract management. From time to time, we are involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, and other disputes arising in the ordinary course of business. These suits concern issues including product liability, contract disputes, employee-related matters, and personal injury matters. It is not feasible to predict the outcome of all pending suits and claims, and the ultimate resolution of these matters as well as future lawsuits that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or reputation. We may face product liability claims that are costly and create adverse publicity. If any of the products that we sell cause harm to any of our customers, we could be exposed to product liability lawsuits. If we were found liable under product liability claims, we could be required to pay substantial monetary damages. Further, even if we successfully defended ourselves against this type of claim, we could be forced to spend a substantial amount of money in litigation expenses, our management could be required to spend valuable time in the defense against these claims, and our reputation could suffer.  Changes in the method of determining the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest rates on our outstanding variable rate indebtedness.Certain of our variable rate debt, including the Ryerson Credit Facility, currently uses LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing certain interest rates. LIBOR is the subject of recent proposals for reform and on July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has begun publishing a Secured Overnight Funding Rate (“SOFR”), which is intended to replace U.S. dollar LIBOR, and central banks in several other jurisdictions have also announced plans for alternative reference rates for other currencies. These reforms may cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or to disappear entirely. The consequences of these developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted but may result in an increase in the interest cost of our variable rate indebtedness. In the future, we may need to renegotiate our outstanding indebtedness or incur other indebtedness, and the phase-out of LIBOR may negatively impact the terms of such indebtedness. In addition, the overall financial market may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Disruption in the financial market could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.RISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCKThe market price for our common stock may be volatile.Historically, there has been volatility in the market price for our common stock. Furthermore, the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in the future in response to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the risk factors described herein. Examples include: •changes in commodity prices, especially metals; •announcement of our quarterly operating results or the operating results of other metals service centers;  •changes in financial estimates or recommendations by stock market analysts regarding us or our competitors; •the operating and stock performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable; •press releases, earnings releases, or publicity relating to us or our competitors or relating to trends in the metals service center industry; •inability to meet securities analysts’ and investors’ quarterly or annual estimates or targets of our performance; •sales of our common stock by large or controlling shareholders; •the amount of shares acquired for short-term investments; •general domestic or international economic, market, and political conditions; and •announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, dispositions or joint ventures, or other material events impacting the domestic or global metals industry.In the past, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their specific operating performance. These factors may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of actual operating performance.21 In addition, stock markets from time to time experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. In the past, some shareholders have brought securities class action lawsuits against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. In the future we may be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation, regardless of whether our defense is ultimately successful, could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources.We have not paid cash dividends since our initial public offering in 2014 and any future dividend payments are at the discretion of our Board of Directors.We have not declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock or any other equity security since our initial public offering in 2014. The amounts that may be available to us to pay cash dividends are restricted under our debt agreements. Any payment of cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, future prospects, contractual restrictions, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Therefore, you should not rely on dividend income from shares of our common stock. For more information, see “Dividend Policy.” Your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in us may be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and you sell your shares at a profit, but there is no guarantee that the market price for our common stock will ever exceed the price that you pay for our common stock.Our corporate documents and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of the Company.Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our Board of Directors. These provisions: •establish a classified Board of Directors so that not all members of our Board of Directors are elected at one time; •authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock; •provide that the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our amended and restated bylaws; •prohibit stockholders from acting by written consent if less than a majority of the voting power of our outstanding stock is controlled by Platinum; and •establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.Any issuance of preferred stock could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our common stock, which could depress the price of our common stock.Our Board of Directors will have the authority to issue preferred stock and to determine the preferences, limitations, and relative rights of shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Our preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend, and other rights superior to the rights of our common stock. The potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of us, discouraging bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price, and adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.22 RISKS RELATED TO OUR CAPITAL STRUCTUREWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations. We currently have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020, our total indebtedness was approximately $740.0 million and we had approximately $277 million of unused capacity under the Ryerson Credit Facility. Our substantial indebtedness may:  •make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our outstanding notes and our other indebtedness;  •limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes;  •limit our ability to use our cash flow for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes;  •require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;  •limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;  •place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and  •increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of the Ryerson Credit Facility and the indenture governing our outstanding notes restrict but do not prohibit us from doing so, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify. The covenants in the Ryerson Credit Facility and the indenture governing our notes impose, and covenants contained in agreements governing indebtedness that we incur in the future may impose, restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility. The Ryerson Credit Facility and the indenture governing our outstanding notes contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries, including JT Ryerson, to:  •incur additional debt;  •pay dividends on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock;  •make certain investments or other restricted payments;  •create liens or use assets as security in other transactions;  •merge, consolidate, transfer, or dispose of substantially all of our assets; and  •engage in transactions with affiliates. The terms of the Ryerson Credit Facility require that, in the event availability under the facility declines to a certain level, we maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter. Total credit availability is limited by the amount of eligible accounts receivable, inventory, and qualified cash pledged as collateral under the agreement insofar as the Company is subject to a borrowing base comprised of the aggregate of these three amounts, less applicable reserves. As of December 31, 2020, total credit availability was $277 million. See discussion regarding the Ryerson Credit Facility in Note 10: “Debt” of Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and the Supplemental Data” as well as the discussion within the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”Additionally, subject to certain exceptions, the indenture governing the outstanding notes restricts JT Ryerson’s ability to pay Ryerson Holding dividends. Our future indebtedness may contain covenants more restrictive in certain respects than the restrictions contained in the Ryerson Credit Facility and the indenture governing the notes. Operating results below current levels or other adverse factors, including a significant increase in interest rates, could result in our being unable to comply with financial covenants that are contained in the Ryerson Credit Facility or that may be contained in any future indebtedness. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to holders of our notes and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions. 23 We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness. We are highly leveraged. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our outstanding notes, the Ryerson Credit Facility, and our other outstanding indebtedness are expected to account for significant cash interest expenses. Accordingly, we will have to generate significant cash flows from operations to meet our debt service requirements. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service and working capital requirements, we may be required to sell assets, seek additional capital, reduce capital expenditures, restructure or refinance all or a portion of our existing indebtedness, or seek additional financing. Moreover, insufficient cash flow may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. The right to receive payment on the 2028 Notes and the guarantees will be subordinated to the liabilities of non-guarantor subsidiaries.The notes and related guarantees are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness of our subsidiaries that are non-guarantors of the 2028 Senior Secured Notes (the “2028 Notes”). While the indenture governing the 2028 Notes limits the indebtedness and activities of these non-guarantor subsidiaries, holders of indebtedness of, and trade creditors of, non-guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under bank financing agreements, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before those assets are made available for distribution to any guarantor, as direct or indirect shareholder. While the non-guarantor subsidiaries have agreed under the indenture not to pledge or encumber their assets (other than with respect to permitted liens) without equally and ratably securing the notes, they will not guarantee the 2028 Notes notwithstanding any such pledge or encumbrance in favor of the 2028 Notes.The non-guarantor subsidiaries represented, respectively, 10.9% and 52.5% of our net sales and EBITDA for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, these non-guarantor subsidiaries represented respectively, 12.2% and 7.7% of our assets and liabilities, as of December 31, 2020.Accordingly, in the event that any of the non-guarantor subsidiaries or joint venture entities become insolvent, liquidates, or otherwise reorganizes: •the creditors of the guarantors (including the holders of the 2028 Notes) will have no right to proceed against such subsidiary’s assets; and  •the creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of assets of such subsidiary, as direct or indirect shareholder, and will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.Because a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain prevailing short-term interest rates, we are vulnerable to interest rate increases. A portion of our indebtedness, including the Ryerson Credit Facility, bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain short-term prevailing interest rates. As of December 31, 2020, we had $285.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Ryerson Credit Facility, with an additional $277 million available for borrowing under such facility. Assuming a consistent level of debt through-out 2020, a 100 basis point change in the interest rate on our floating rate debt effective from the beginning of the year would increase or decrease our interest expense under the Ryerson Credit Facility by approximately $2.5 million on an annual basis. If interest rates increase dramatically, we could be unable to service our debt, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Changes in our credit ratings and outlook may reduce access to capital and increase borrowing costs.Our credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and factors outside of our control, such as conditions affecting our industry generally or the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies. We cannot provide assurances that our current credit ratings will remain in effect or that the ratings will not be lowered, suspended, or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies. If rating agencies lower, suspend, or withdraw the ratings, the market price or marketability of our securities may be adversely affected. In addition, any negative change in ratings could make it more difficult for us to raise capital on acceptable terms, impact the ability to obtain adequate financing, and result in higher interest costs for our existing credit facilities, including the Ryerson Credit Facility, or on future financings.24 RISKS RELATED TO OUR STOCKHOLDER BASEPlatinum owns a significant percentage of our stock and has the right to nominate a majority of the members of the Corporation’s board and will be able to exert control over matters subject to stockholder approval.Platinum owns approximately 21,037,500 shares of our common stock, which is approximately 55% of our issued and outstanding common stock. Therefore, Platinum may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, Platinum may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that our stockholders may believe are in their best interest as stockholders.The Company is party to an investor rights agreement (the “Investor Rights Agreement”) with certain affiliates of Platinum which provides, among other things, that for so long as Platinum collectively beneficially owns (i) at least 30% of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the Company, Platinum will have the right to nominate for election to the board of directors of the Company no fewer than that number of directors that would constitute a majority of the number of directors if there were no vacancies on the board, (ii) at least 15% but less than 30% of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the Company, Platinum will have the right to nominate two directors, and (iii) at least 5% but less than 15% of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the Company, Platinum will have the right to nominate one director. The agreement also provides that if the size of the board of directors is increased or decreased at any time, Platinum’s nomination rights will be proportionately increased or decreased, respectively, rounded up to the nearest whole number. As a result of Platinum’s ownership of a majority of the Company’s outstanding capital stock as well its board nomination rights pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, Platinum may significantly influence or effectively control our policies and operations, including the appointment of management, future issuances of our common stock or other securities, and the payment of dividends. In addition, Platinum has significant control over our decisions to enter into any other corporate transaction. The interests of Platinum may not in all cases be aligned with the interests of the other holders of our common stock. For example, a sale of a substantial number of shares of stock in the future by Platinum could cause our stock price to decline. Further, Platinum could cause us to make acquisitions that increase the amount of the indebtedness that is secured or senior to the Company’s existing debt or sell revenue-generating assets, impairing our ability to make payments under such debt. Additionally, Platinum is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Accordingly, Platinum may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, Platinum may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to holders of our common stock.We are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements because we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the NYSE rules and, as a result, our stockholders do not have the protections afforded by these corporate governance requirements.Because Platinum controls more than 50% of the voting power of our common stock, we are considered to be a “controlled company” for purposes of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) listing requirements. Under the NYSE rules, a “controlled company” may elect not to comply with certain NYSE corporate governance requirements, including (1) the requirement that a majority of our Board of Directors consist of independent directors, (2) the requirement that the nominating and corporate governance committee of our Board of Directors be composed entirely of independent directors, (3) the requirement that the compensation committee of our Board of Directors be composed entirely of independent directors, and (4) the requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nomination/corporate governance and compensation committees. Given that Platinum controls a majority of the voting power of our common stock, we are permitted, and have elected, to opt out of compliance with certain NYSE corporate governance requirements. Accordingly, holders of our common stock do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements"

Ryerson Holding Corporation (“Ryerson Holding”), a Delaware corporation, is the parent company of Joseph T. Ryerson & Son, Inc. (“JT Ryerson”), a Delaware corporation. Affiliates of Platinum Equity, LLC (“Platinum”) own approximately 21,037,500 shares of our common stock, which is approximately 56% of our issued and outstanding common stock. We are a leading metals service center, value-added processor, and distributor of industrial metals with operations in the United States through JT Ryerson, in Canada through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Ryerson Canada, Inc., a Canadian corporation (“Ryerson Canada”), and in Mexico through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Ryerson Metals de Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V., a Mexican corporation (“Ryerson Mexico”). In addition to our North American operations, we also operate in China through an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Ryerson China Limited (“Ryerson China”). Unless the context indicates otherwise, Ryerson Holding, JT Ryerson, Ryerson Canada, Ryerson China, and Ryerson Mexico together with their subsidiaries, are collectively referred to herein as “Ryerson,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company.” Our Company We are one of the largest value-add processors and distributors of industrial metals in North America measured in terms of sales. We have approximately 4,500 employees across 95 facilities in North America and four facilities in China. Through this network we serve approximately 42,000 customers across a wide range of manufacturing end markets. Our customers range from local, independently owned fabricators and machine shops to large, international original equipment manufacturers. We carry a full line of nearly 75,000 products in stainless steel, aluminum, carbon steel, and alloy steels and a limited line of nickel and red metals in various shapes and forms. In addition to our metals products, we offer numerous value-added processing and fabrication services, and more than 75% of the products we sell are processed to meet customer requirements.  Our business strategy includes providing a superior level of customer service and responsiveness, technical services, and inventory management solutions while maintaining low operating costs in order to maximize financial results. Our growth strategy is based on increasing our operating results through organic growth activities and strategic acquisitions.  To that end, we continue to focus on our interconnected network, systems, and to enhance our value-added services and online presence to provide increased access, functionality, and flexibility to our customers. Our service centers are strategically located near our customers, which permits us to quickly process and deliver our products and services, often within the next day of receiving an order. We own, lease, or contract a fleet of tractors and trailers, allowing us to efficiently meet our customers’ delivery demands. Our range of products together with our breadth of services allows us to service a diverse customer base and to create long-term partnerships with our customers and enhances our profitability. We focus on strategic acquisitions that complement and enhance our product, customer, and geographic diversification.  On July 2, 2018, JT Ryerson acquired Central Steel and Wire Company (“CS&W”), a leading metal service center with locations across the Central and Eastern United States offering a wide selection of products and capabilities, with a commercial portfolio centered on bar, tube, plate, and steel products. Since our acquisition of CS&W, we have focused on improving their operating performance through efficiencies by integrating them into our operational model. Industry Overview Metals service centers serve as key intermediaries between metal producers and end users of metal products. They purchase in scale and sell in smaller quantities.  End-users often look for “one-stop” suppliers that offer lower order volumes, shorter lead times, more reliable delivery, and processing services. Metal producers mainly sell metals in the form of standard-sized coils, sheets, plates, structurals, bars, and tubes in large quantities, with longer lead times, and limited inventory. Metal service centers serve as key intermediaries closing the gap between metal producers’ supply and end-users’ demand. By aggregating end-users’ demand and purchasing metal in bulk to take advantage of economies of scale, metals service centers may purchase, process, and deliver metal to end‑users in a more efficient and cost‑effective manner than the end‑user may achieve by dealing directly with the primary producer. Further, specialized metals processing equipment is costly and requires high‑volume production to be cost effective. In addition, many customers are not able or willing to invest in the necessary technology, equipment, and warehousing of inventory to efficiently and effectively perform metal processing for their own operations.  Due to this, many customers have reduced their in-house processing capabilities, opting to source processed metal from service centers like us.  This saves our customers time, labor, and expense, reducing their overall manufacturing costs, while permitting us to focus on value-added services and increasing our fabrication mix. This supports our capital expenditures on processing equipment to grow annual gross 4 profit margin. Our industry is highly fragmented with the largest companies accounting for only a small percentage of total market share. The majority of metals services companies have limited product lines and inventories, with customers located in a specific geographic area. In general, competition is based on quality, service, price, and geographic proximity. We primarily compete with other metals service centers and to a lesser extent with metal producers.  The metals service center industry typically experiences cash flow trends that are counter-cyclical to the revenue and volume growth of the industry. During an industry downturn, companies generally reduce working capital assets and generate cash as inventory and accounts receivable balances decline. As a result, operating cash flow and liquidity tend to increase during a downturn, which typically facilitates industry participants’ ability to cover fixed costs and repay outstanding debt. Competitive Strengths Leading Market Position in North America. Based on sales, we believe we are one of the largest service center companies for carbon, stainless steel, and aluminum in the North American market where we have a broad geographic presence with 95 facilities. Our service centers are located near our customer locations, enabling us to provide timely delivery to customers across numerous geographic markets. Additionally, our widespread network of locations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico helps us to utilize our expertise to more efficiently serve customers with complex supply chain requirements across multiple manufacturing locations. We believe this is a key differentiator for customers who need a supplier that can reliably and consistently support them. Our ability to transfer inventory among our facilities better enables us to more timely and profitably source and process specialized items at regional locations throughout our network than if we were required to maintain inventory of all products and specialized equipment at each location. Broad Geographic Reach Across Attractive End Markets. Our operations serve a diverse range of industries including commercial ground transportation, metal fabrication and machine shops, industrial machinery and equipment manufacturing, consumer durable equipment, HVAC manufacturing, construction equipment manufacturing, food processing and agricultural equipment manufacturing, and oil and gas. We believe this broad range of industries in which we sell our products and services reduces our risk related to a downturn in a specific industry. We believe that our ability to quickly adjust our offering based on regional and industry specific trends creates stability while also providing the opportunity to access specific growth markets. Established Platform for Organic and Acquisition Growth. Our growth strategy is based on increasing our operating results through organic growth activities and strategic acquisitions that enhance our product, customer, and geographic diversification. Our strategies, include investing in value-added processing capabilities, analytically targeting attractive customers and end markets with our supply chain optimization service model, industry consolidation through targeted M&A, and providing customers faster and easier solutions to their metal needs, which we believe will provide us with growth opportunities. Given the highly fragmented nature of the metals service center industry, we believe there are numerous additional opportunities to acquire businesses and incorporate them into our existing infrastructure. In addition, due to our large scale and geographic reach, we believe we can improve operating performance through efficiencies by integrating acquired businesses into our operational model, thus providing greater purchasing power, improving expense and working capital management, access to additional end markets, and broadening product mix. Lean Operating Structure Providing Operating Leverage. Ryerson has demonstrated the ability to effectively manage expenses through tactical productivity and spending improvements.  In a stronger metals service center environment characterized by increases in demand and/or pricing, we believe that most additional expenses to service higher revenue and margins would come from variable expenses while further leveraging economies of scale on our existing fixed expenses. We effectively managed our costs in 2019 with increased volume, as expenses as a percentage of sales declined from 14.0% in 2018 to 13.7% in 2019.  We also continue to focus on inventory management. While average inventory days excluding LIFO increased from 73 days in 2018 to 76 days in 2019, this increase is due to the acquisition of CS&W in July 2018. On a same-store basis, days of supply decreased from 71 days in 2018 to 70 days in 2019, within management’s target range of 70 to 75 days.  5 Extensive Breadth of Products and Services for Diverse Customer Base. We believe our broad product mix and marketing approach provides customers with a “one-stop shop” solution few other metals service center companies are able to offer. We provide a broad range of processing and fabrication services to meet the needs of our approximately 42,000 customers and typically fulfill more than 1,600,000 orders per year. We provide supply chain solutions, including just-in-time delivery and value-added processing to many original equipment manufacturing customers. For the year ended December 31, 2019, no single customer, including their subcontractors, accounted for more than 6% of our sales, and our top 10 customers, including their subcontractors accounted for approximately 15% of our sales. Strong Relationships with Suppliers. We are among the largest purchasers of metals in North America and have long-term relationships with many of our North American suppliers. We believe we are frequently one of the largest customers of our suppliers and that concentrating our orders among a core group of suppliers is effective for obtaining favorable pricing and service. We believe we have the opportunity to further leverage this strength through continued focus on price and volume using an analytics-driven approach to procurement. In addition, we view our strategic suppliers as supply chain partners. We focus on logistics, lead times, rolling schedules, and scrap return programs to drive value-based buying that is advantageous for us. Metals producers worldwide are consolidating, and large, geographically diversified customers, such as Ryerson, are desirable partners for these larger suppliers. Our relationships with suppliers often provide us with access to metals when supply is constrained. Through our knowledge of the global metals marketplace and capabilities of specific mills we believe we have developed an advantageous global purchasing strategy. Experienced Management Team with Deep Industry Knowledge. Our senior management team has extensive industry and operational experience and has been instrumental in optimizing and implementing our strategy over the last five years. Our senior management has an average of more than 20 years of experience in the metals or service center industries. Our CEO, Mr. Edward Lehner, who joined the Company in August 2012 as CFO and became CEO in June 2015, has nearly 30 years of experience, predominantly in the metals industry. Our regional presidents, Mr. Mike Burbach and Mr. Kevin Richardson each have over 35 years of experience with the Company. Industry Outlook The Institute for Supply Management’s Purchasing Managers’ Index (“PMI”) reported growth in January of 2020 with a reading above 50%, indicating expansion in factory activity, after five months of reported softness. However, PMI has overall reported general economic expansion for the last three years as readings have exceeded 50% for 31 of the last 36 months. The PMI measures the economic health of the manufacturing sector and is a composite index based on five indicators: new orders, inventory levels, production, supplier deliveries, and the employment environment. PMI readings can be a good indicator of industrial activity and general economic growth. Additionally, the overall U.S. economy is projected to maintain growth as evidenced by the Federal Reserve’s midrange forecasted real GDP growth rates of 2.0%, 1.9%, and 1.8% for 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively. Steel demand in North America is largely dependent on growth of the automotive, industrial equipment, consumer appliance, and construction end markets. One of our key end markets is the industrial equipment sector, and according to the latest Livingston Survey, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, U.S. industrial production expanded by 0.9% in 2019 and is expected to grow by 0.8% in 2020, and 1.0% in 2021. China continues to be a key driver in the growth of global metals demand. According to the International Monetary Fund, China’s GDP maintained growth of 6.1% in 2019 and is projected to grow 5.6% in 2020 and 5.9% in 2021.Products and Services We carry a full line of carbon steel, stainless steel, alloy steels, and aluminum, and a limited line of nickel and red metals. These materials are stocked in a number of shapes, including coils, sheets, rounds, hexagons, square and flat bars, plates, structurals, and tubing.We also provide a wide variety of processing services to meet our customers’ needs. Most of the products that we carry require expensive specialized equipment for material handling and processing. We believe few of our customers have the capability to process the metal into the desired sizes, forms, or finishes or they are unwilling to incur the significant capital expenditures to acquire the 6 necessary equipment. We are growing and diversifying our product mix mainly as a result of our targeted growth strategy to provide increased levels of value-added processing services. We believe our enhanced processing capabilities will increase our ability to sell higher-margin metals processing services to a larger group of customers. We expect this, together and with our focus on maintaining pricing discipline related to our processing services, will increase our gross profit margin.We had capital expenditures of $154.6 million in the five-year period ended December 31, 2019. We are increasing our investments in processing equipment due to customers requesting higher levels of value-added processing.  We expect this to increase our profitability. We currently perform processing services on more than 75% of the materials sold by us. The following table shows our percentage of sales by major product lines for 2019, 2018, and 2017:  Product Line 2019  2018  2017 Carbon Steel Flat  26%  27%  28%Carbon Steel Plate  11   11   10 Carbon Steel Long  16   14   12 Stainless Steel Flat  15   16   18 Stainless Steel Plate  4   4   4 Stainless Steel Long  4   4   4 Aluminum Flat  15   15   15 Aluminum Plate  2   3   3 Aluminum Long  5   4   4 Other  2   2   2 Total  100%  100%  100%We are not dependent on any particular customer group or industry because we process and distribute a variety of metals. This diversity of product type and material reduces our exposure to fluctuations or other weaknesses in the financial or economic stability of particular customers or industries. We are also less dependent on any particular suppliers as a result of our product diversification.Customers and Markets Our customer base is diverse, numbering approximately 42,000 in a variety of industries, including metal fabrication and machine shops, industrial machinery and equipment, commercial ground transportation, consumer durable, food processing and agricultural equipment, construction equipment, and HVAC. Although we sell directly to many large original equipment manufacturers, the majority of our sales are to smaller customers, including small machine shops and fabricators, in small quantities with frequent deliveries, helping them manage their working capital and credit needs more efficiently.For the year ended December 31, 2019, no single customer, including their subcontractors, accounted for more than 6% of our sales, and our top 10 customers, including their subcontractors accounted for approximately 15% of our sales. Substantially all of our sales are attributable to our U.S. operations and substantially all of our long-lived assets are located in the United States. The following table shows the Company’s percentage of sales by metal consuming industry for 2019, 2018, and 2017:   Percentage of Sales Metal Consuming Industry 2019  2018  2017 Metal fabrication and machine shops  23%  22%  20%Industrial machinery and equipment  18   18   18 Commercial ground transportation  16   16   16 Consumer durable  11   11   11 Food processing and agricultural equipment  10   10   10 Construction equipment  8   8   9 HVAC  6   6   7 Oil & gas  4   5   5 Other  4   4   4 Total  100%  100%  100%Our customers are primarily located throughout the United States, but we also have international customers. Most customers are located near to one of our facilities, thus enabling an efficient delivery system capable of handling a high frequency of short lead time 7 orders. We transport our products directly to customers via our in-house and dedicated truck fleet, which further supports the just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers, and via third-party trucking firms.We process our metals to specific customer orders as well as for stocking programs. Many of our larger customers commit to purchase on a regular basis at agreed upon or indexed prices for periods ranging from three to twelve months. To help mitigate price volatility risks, these price commitments are generally matched with corresponding supply arrangements, or to a lesser degree by commodity hedges. Customers notify us of specific release dates for processed products. Customers typically notify us of release dates anywhere from on a just-in-time basis to one month before the release date. Consequently, we are required to carry sufficient inventory to meet the short lead time and just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers. We also have international facilities located in Canada, Mexico and China.  Net sales of our international locations (based on where the shipments originated) accounted for approximately 10.4% of our consolidated 2019 net sales, or $424.8 million. See Note 13 — “Segment information” of Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further information on U.S. and foreign revenues and assets.Customer demand may change from time to time based on, among other things, general economic conditions and industry capacity. Many of the industries in which our customers compete are cyclical in nature. We believe that our various and diverse offerings, ways-to-markets, and end markets reduce the volatility of our business in the aggregate, thus somewhat reducing earnings volatility.  A portion of our customers experience seasonal slowdowns. Our sales, as measured in tonnage sold, in the months of July, November, and December traditionally have been lower than in other months because of a reduced number of shipping days and holiday or vacation closures for some customers. Consequently, our sales in the first two quarters of the year are usually higher than in the third and fourth quarters.Suppliers  We purchase the majority of our inventories from key domestic metals suppliers. Because of our total volume of purchases and our long‑term relationships with our suppliers, we believe that we are generally able to purchase inventory at the best prices offered by our suppliers.For the year ended December 31, 2019, our top 25 suppliers, including their subcontractors, accounted for approximately 71% of our purchase dollars. We are generally able to meet our materials requirements because we use many suppliers, there is a substantial overlap of product offerings from these suppliers, and there are several other suppliers able to provide identical or similar products. While the metals producing supply base has experienced significant consolidation and supply interruptions due to tariffs under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, we believe both our size and our long-term relationships with our suppliers will continue enable us to meet our material requirements. Sales and Marketing We maintain our own professional sales force. In addition to our office sales staff, we market and sell our products through the use of our field sales force that we believe has extensive product and customer knowledge and offers a comprehensive catalog of our products. Our office and field sales staffs, which together consist of approximately 790 employees, include technical personnel. Additionally, we offer our customers the ability to purchase our products through our e-commerce website.Because our business is relationship-based, we operate under many different trade names. Businesses we acquire often have strong customer relationships and solid reputations, and we will often continue to use the acquired business name to maintain existing customer relationships.8 Capital Expenditures We continued to focus on organic growth in 2019 by expanding existing facilities and adding processing equipment.  Investments by us in property, plant, and equipment, together with asset retirements for the five years ended December 31, 2019, excluding the initial purchase price of acquisitions are set forth below. The net capital change during such period aggregated to an increase of $52.6 million.    Additions  Retirementsor Sales  Net   (In millions) 2019 $45.8  $57.5  $(11.7)2018  38.4   5.5   32.9 2017  25.1   24.9   0.2 2016  23.0   5.0   18.0 2015  22.3   9.1   13.2  The net reduction in 2019 is related to a sale lease-back transaction. See Part II, Item 8, Note 6: Leases for additional information. We currently anticipate capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, of up to approximately $45 million for 2020, much of which is related to organic growth activities comprised of maintenance, or purchases of, equipment. We expect capital expenditures will be funded from cash generated by operations and available borrowings. We will continue to evaluate and execute each growth project in light of the economic conditions and outlook at the time of investment and may significantly reduce our capital expenditures if economic conditions warrant a more conservative approach to capital allocation.Employees As of December 31, 2019, we employed approximately 4,200 persons in North America and 300 persons in China. Our North American workforce was comprised of approximately 1,800 office employees and approximately 2,400 plant employees. Sixteen percent of our plant employees were members of various unions, including the United Steel Workers and The International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Renewals of four union contracts covering 89 employees were successfully negotiated in 2019. Nine contracts covering 192 employees are currently scheduled to expire in 2020.Environmental, Health, and Safety Matters Our facilities and operations are subject to many foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and to health and safety. In particular, our operations are subject to extensive requirements relating to waste disposal, recycling, air and water emissions, the handling of regulated materials, remediation, underground storage tanks, asbestos-containing building materials, workplace exposure, and other matters. We believe that our operations are currently in substantial compliance with all such laws and do not presently anticipate substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future in order to meet environmental, workplace health or safety requirements, or to pay for any investigations, corrective action, or claims. Claims, enforcement actions, or investigations regarding personal injury, property damage, or violation of environmental laws could result in substantial costs to us, divert our management’s attention, and result in significant liabilities, fines, or the suspension or interruption of our facilities. We continue to analyze and implement safeguards to mitigate any environmental, health, and safety risks we may face. As a result, additional costs and liabilities may be incurred to comply with future requirements or to address newly discovered conditions, and these costs and liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. For example, there is increasing likelihood that additional regulation of greenhouse gas emissions will occur at the foreign, federal, state, and local level, which could affect us, our suppliers, and our customers. While the costs of compliance could be significant, given the uncertain outcome and timing of future action by the U.S. federal government and states on this issue, we cannot accurately predict the financial impact of future greenhouse gas regulations on our operations or our customers at this time. We do not currently anticipate any new programs disproportionately impacting us compared to our competitors. Some of the properties currently or previously owned or leased by us are located in industrial areas or have a long history of heavy industrial use. We may incur environmental liabilities with respect to these properties in the future including costs of investigations, corrective action, claims for natural resource damages, claims by third parties relating to property damages, or claims relating to contamination at sites where we have sent waste for treatment or disposal. Based on currently available information we do not expect any investigation, remediation matters, or claims related to properties presently or formerly owned, operated, or to which 9 we have sent waste for treatment or disposal would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. In October 2011, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) named JT Ryerson as one of more than 100 businesses that may be a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) for the Portland Harbor Superfund Site (the “PHS Site”). On January 6, 2017, the EPA issued an initial Record of Decision (“ROD”) regarding the site. The ROD includes a combination of dredging, capping, and enhanced natural recovery that would take approximately thirteen years to construct plus additional time for monitored natural recovery, at an estimated present value cost of $1.05 billion. In a change from its prior stance, at a meeting on December 4, 2018, the EPA indicated that it expected PRPs to submit a plan during 2019 to start remediation of the river and harbor per the original ROD within the next two to three years. The EPA also indicated that it expected allocation of amounts among the parties to be determined in the same two to three-year time frame. The EPA invited certain PRPs to a May 2, 2019 meeting to discuss starting the remedial design process. The EPA did not include JT Ryerson in those meetings. On December 9, 2019, a PRP group met with Administrator Wheeler, the head of the EPA, to discuss updating the ROD as recent testing indicates that the levels of contamination have “drastically improved” and, thus, remediation should be much less drastic than that in the current ROD. We have been informed that Administrator Wheeler is requiring regional EPA staff to engage in discussions with the PRP group before moving forward with any enforcement action. The EPA indicated in a January 2, 2020 “progress update” letter that it is negotiating with certain parties to perform remedial design work at five unspecified areas which comprise 52% of the overall acreage subject to remediation.  It is unclear if any of these areas include the areas where our former facilities were located. As a result of the ongoing negotiations over the ROD, the EPA’s decision not to meet with smaller parties, and the December 9, 2019 meeting with Administrator Wheeler, the discussions with the EPA regarding remedial design appear to be delayed. The EPA has stated that it is willing to consider de minimis settlements, which JT Ryerson is trying to pursue; however, the EPA has not begun meeting with any of the smaller parties who have requested de minimis or de micromis status, stating that it does not have sufficient information to determine whether any parties meet such criteria and does not intend to begin those considerations until after the remedial design work is completed. It has met with selected parties that we believe to be larger targets. JT Ryerson has not been invited to meet with the EPA.The EPA has not yet allocated responsibility for the contamination among the potentially responsible parties, including JT Ryerson. We do not currently have sufficient information available to us to determine whether the ROD will be executed as currently stated, whether and to what extent JT Ryerson may be held responsible for any of the identified contamination, and how much (if any) of the final plan’s costs might ultimately be allocated to JT Ryerson. Therefore, management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or estimate a range of potential loss at this time.Excluding any potential additional remediation costs resulting from any corrective action for the properties described above, we expect spending for pollution control projects to remain at historical levels below $500,000 per year. Our United States operations are also subject to the Department of Transportation Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations. We operate a private trucking motor fleet for making deliveries to some of our customers. Our drivers do not carry any material quantities of hazardous materials. Our foreign operations are subject to similar regulations. Future regulations could increase maintenance, replacement, and fuel costs for our fleet. These costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. Intellectual Property We own several U.S. and foreign trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Certain of the trademarks are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and, in certain circumstances, with the trademark offices of various foreign countries. We consider certain other information owned by us to be trade secrets. We protect our trade secrets by, among other things, entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees regarding such matters and implementing measures to restrict access to sensitive data and computer software source code on a need-to-know basis. We believe that these safeguards adequately protect our proprietary rights and we vigorously defend these rights. While we consider all our intellectual property rights as a whole to be important, we do not consider any single right to be essential to our operations as a whole. Corporate ResponsibilityRyerson is committed to operating with a high level of integrity. We are driven by our dedication to support the communities we serve, deliver products that meet our stringent quality and compliance standards, and maintain a high environmental, health, and safety 10 standard to protect our people and the places where we operate. We work to continually improve each of these areas to make Ryerson an even better company for tomorrow.Below are some highlights of our corporate responsibility programs. SustainabilityAs part of our efforts to operate with a high level of integrity, we continuously monitor and analyze ourselves and our supply-chain relationships.  We strive, and expect our suppliers, to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and Ryerson's Human Rights Policy, Conflict Minerals Policy, and Code of Ethics and Business Conduct.We are committed to mitigating the impact our operations and products have on the environment. As an operator of metals service centers, our day-to-day business consists of the sale, distribution, and processing of a broad variety of metal products sourced from numerous primary metal producers. Our operations, by their nature, do not emit significant amounts of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases. Further, according to the Steel Recycling Institute, we believe steel, one of our most significant products, is the most recycled material on the planet—more than plastic, paper, and glass combined each year—which provides a strong foundation for our sustainability efforts. The Steel Recycling Institute notes that two out of every three tons of new steel are produced from old steel. As part of our commitment to environmental sustainability, we: •purchase significant volumes of metal that has been produced using recycled materials or scrap melted in electric arc furnaces; •sell scrap material generated in our operations to recyclers; and •source most of our steel from North American metal producers, which have substantially lower greenhouse gas emissions than Chinese producers.We also use propane fuel to operate forklifts and have installed energy efficient lighting in many of our operations and utilize energy efficient diesel tractors that consume less fuel and reduce emissions for the majority of our trucking fleet to further mitigate our impact on the environment.  Employee SafetyUpholding a safe workplace is one of our core values and a part of the company's culture. Our safety standards, which go beyond the minimum requirements required by applicable law, have helped protect the well-being of our people and prevent workplace injuries that can impact business productivity. We continuously work to maintain a safety performance rating that outperforms the industry average and have implemented an Environmental, Health, and Safety policy that reinforces the goal of a zero-injury workplace. Our low recordable injury rate compared to our peers in the metal services industry, based on U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) criteria, reflects our effectiveness in protecting our employees. In 2019, forty-three of our facilities operated with zero OSHA recordable injuries for the entire year, and seventy-three of our facilities operated with zero OSHA recordable injuries during the fourth quarter. Our 2019 performance at our facilities, measured as the number of OSHA recordable injuries per 200,000 labor hours, was 2.66, which was almost two times better than the industry average as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Community RelationsWe are committed to helping build better communities in the places where we operate. We invest in the community and our people in a variety of ways, from volunteerism to providing educational resources to help our employees and families advance their careers: •Service & Giving — We support numerous charitable organizations, including those that promote good health, children's causes, educational advancement, and community programs, through volunteer efforts. We encourage our employees to give back to the communities they call home through the Ryerson Gives Back program. Employees are encouraged to volunteer their time from working in food kitchens to participating in community events and trainings. Through our employees, we are actively involved in building and supporting our local communities. Additionally, as a part of the Ryerson internship program, each group of interns develop and implement a community service project. Past intern projects have focused on waste reduction, raising money to benefit charities, feeding the homeless, and elementary education. •College Scholarship Program and Tuition Reimbursement — For nearly 100 years, we have supported the continuing education of our employees’ families through a college scholarship program. As part of this program, we awarded last year approximately $90,000 in academic scholarships to students graduating from high school that are children or 11  dependents of Ryerson employees. We also support the continuing education of our employees through tuition reimbursement programs.Available Information All periodic and current reports and other filings that we are required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are available free of charge from the SEC’s website (www.sec.gov) or through our Investor Relations website at www.ir.ryerson.com.

You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the other information in this report, including the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors below will not occur. These risks could have a material and adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Risks Related to Our Business and IndustryWeakness in the economy, market trends, and other conditions affecting the profitability and financial stability of our customers could negatively impact our sales growth and results of operations. Economic and industry trends affect our business environments. We serve several industries in which the demand for our products and services is sensitive to the production activity, capital spending, and demand for products and services of our customers. Many of these customers operate in markets that are subject to highly cyclical fluctuations resulting from seasonality, market uncertainty, costs of goods sold, currency exchange rates, foreign competition, offshoring of production, oil and natural gas prices, geopolitical developments, and a variety of other factors beyond our control. Any of these factors could cause customers to idle or close facilities, delay purchases, reduce production levels, or experience reductions in the demand for their own products or services.Any of these events could impair the ability of our customers to make full and timely payments or reduce the volume of products and services these customers purchase from us and could cause increased pressure on our selling prices and terms of sale. We do not expect the cyclical nature of our industry to change and any downturn in our customers’ industries could reduce our revenues and profitability or a significant or prolonged slowdown in activity in the United States (U.S.), Canada, or any other major world economy, or a segment of any such economy, could negatively impact our sales growth and results of operations.The metals services business is very competitive and increased competition could reduce our revenues and gross margins. We face competition in all markets we serve, from metals producers that sell directly to certain customers or segments of the market, to other metal services companies.  The metals services industry itself is highly fragmented and competitive. There are a few large competitors, but most of the market is served by small local and regional competitors. Competition is based principally on price, service, quality, production capabilities, inventory availability, and timely delivery. We are experiencing increased pressure from online businesses that compete with price transparency. We expect technological advancements and the increased use of e-commerce solutions within the industry to continue to evolve at a rapid pace. As a result, our ability to effectively compete requires us to respond and adapt to new industry trends and developments, and implement new technology and innovations that may result in unexpected costs or may take longer than expected. 12 To remain competitive, we must be willing and able to respond to market pressures. These pressures, and the implementation, timing, and results of our strategic pricing and other responses, could have a material effect on our sales and profitability. If we are unable to grow sales or reduce costs, among other actions, to wholly or partially offset the effect on profitability of our pricing actions, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.  Changing metals prices may have a significant impact on our liquidity, net sales, gross margins, operating income, and net income. The metals services industry as a whole is cyclical and, at times, pricing and availability of metal can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control, including general domestic and international economic conditions, labor costs, sales levels, competition, levels of inventory held by other metals service centers, consolidation of metals producers, higher raw material costs for the producers of metals, import duties and tariffs, and currency exchange rates. This volatility can significantly affect the availability and cost of materials for us.  Our ability to pass on increases in costs in a timely manner depends on market conditions and may result in lower gross margins. In addition, higher prices could impact demand for these products, resulting in lower sales volumes. Moreover, we maintain substantial inventories of metal to accommodate the short lead times and just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers. Accordingly, we purchase metals in an effort to maintain inventory at levels that we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon historic buying practices, contracts with customers, and market conditions. Commitments for metal purchases are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time orders are placed or at the time of shipment. During periods of rising metal prices, we may be negatively impacted by delays between the time of increases in the cost of metals to us and increases in the prices that we charge for our products if we are unable to pass these increased costs on to our customers. In addition, when metal prices decline, this could result in lower selling prices for our products and, as we use existing inventory that we purchased at higher metal prices, lower gross profit margins. Declines in prices or further reductions in sales volumes could adversely impact our ability to maintain our liquidity and to remain in compliance with certain financial covenants under our $1 billion revolving credit facility (the “Ryerson Credit Facility”), as well as result in us incurring inventory or goodwill impairment charges. Consequently, changing metals prices could significantly impact our liquidity, net sales, gross margins, operating income, and net income. Changes in inflation may adversely affect gross margins. Inflation impacts the costs at which we can procure product and the ability to increase prices to customers over time. Prolonged periods of deflation could adversely affect the degree to which we are able to increase sales through price increases.Unexpected product shortages could negatively impact customer relationships, resulting in an adverse impact on results of operations. Disruptions could occur due to factors beyond our control, including economic downturns, political unrest, port slowdowns, trade issues, including increased export or import duties or trade restrictions, health crises, and other factors, any of which could adversely affect a supplier’s ability to manufacture or deliver products to us. For example, China has suffered health crises related to the outbreak of avian influenza and coronavirus strains. Public health problems may result in quarantines, business closures, transportation restrictions, import and export complications, and otherwise cause shortages in the supply of materials, higher costs for available supplies, or cause other disruptions within our operations and supply chain. Public health problems currently cause and may continue to cause increased costs of certain supplies and disruptions and delays within our supply chain, and public health problems may expose us to unanticipated liability or require us to change our business practices. Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in shipments of products or difficulties in obtaining products, any of which may expose us to unanticipated liability or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For our sources of lower cost products from Asia and other areas of the world, the effect of disruptions is typically increased due to the additional lead time required and distances involved.  Further, the risk of disruption is increased due to the current political climate seeking trade reform. In addition, we have strategic relationships with a number of vendors. In the event we are unable to maintain those relations, there might be a loss of competitive pricing advantages which could, in turn, adversely affect results of operations.Changes in customer or product mix could cause the gross margin percentage to decline. From time to time, we experience changes in customer and product mix that affect gross margin. Changes in customer and product mix result primarily from business acquisitions, changes in customer demand, customer acquisitions, selling and marketing activities, and competition. If rapid growth with lower margin customers occurs, we will face pressure to maintain current gross margins, as these customers receive more discounted pricing due to their higher sales volume. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain historical gross margins in the future.13 The volatility of the market could result in a material impairment of goodwill. We evaluate goodwill annually on October 1 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment. Events or changes in circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to our historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner or the use of our assets or the strategy for our overall business, and significant negative industry or economic trends. We test for impairment of goodwill by assessing various qualitative factors with respect to development in our business and the overall economy and calculating the fair value of a reporting unit using a combination of an income approach based on discounted future cash flows and a market approach at the date of valuation. Under the discounted cash flow method, the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated based on expected future economic benefits discounted to a present value at a rate of return commensurate with the risk associated with the investment. Projected cash flows are discounted to present value using an estimated weighted average cost of capital, which considers both returns to equity and debt investors. Please refer to the Section titled “Critical Accounting Estimates - Goodwill,” of Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations,” and Note 1 — “Summary of Accounting and Financial Policies” of Part II, Item 8 ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" for further information.We may not be able to successfully consummate and complete the integration of future acquisitions, and if we are unable to do so, it could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs and/or decreases in revenues and results of operations. We have grown through a combination of internal expansion, acquisitions, and joint ventures. We intend to continue to grow through selective acquisitions, but we may not be able to identify appropriate acquisition candidates, obtain financing on satisfactory terms, consummate acquisitions, or integrate acquired businesses effectively and profitably into our existing operations. Restrictions contained in the agreements governing our notes, the Ryerson Credit Facility, or our other existing or future debt may also inhibit our ability to make certain investments, including acquisitions, and participations in joint ventures. Acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures, and other business combination transactions, both foreign and domestic, involve various inherent risks, such as uncertainties in assessing value, strengths, weaknesses, liabilities, and potential profitability. There is also risk relating to our ability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from the transactions. Additionally, problems could arise from the integration of acquired businesses, including unanticipated changes in the business or industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition. Our future success will depend on our ability to complete the integration of these future acquisitions successfully into our operations. Specifically, after any acquisition, customers may choose to diversify their supply chains to reduce reliance on a single supplier for a portion of their metals needs. We may not be able to retain all of our and an acquisition’s customers, which may adversely affect our business and sales. Integrating acquisitions, particularly large acquisitions, requires us to enhance our operational and financial systems and employ additional qualified personnel, management, and financial resources, and may adversely affect our business by diverting management away from day-to-day operations. Further, failure to successfully integrate acquisitions may adversely affect our profitability by creating significant operating inefficiencies that could increase our operating expenses as a percentage of sales and reduce our operating income. In addition, we may not realize expected cost savings from acquisitions. Any one or more of these factors could cause us to not realize the benefits anticipated or have a negative impact on the fair value of the reporting units. Accordingly, goodwill and intangible assets recorded as a result of acquisitions could become impaired.We may not be able to retain or expand our customer base if the North American manufacturing industry continues to erode through moving offshore or through acquisition and merger or consolidation activity in our customers’ industries. Our customer base primarily includes manufacturing and industrial firms. Some of our customers operate in industries that are undergoing consolidation through acquisition and merger activity; some are considering or have considered relocating production operations overseas or outsourcing particular functions overseas; and some customers have closed as they were unable to compete successfully with overseas competitors. Our facilities are predominately located in the United States and Canada. To the extent that our customers cease U.S. operations, relocate or move operations overseas to regions in which we do not have a presence, we could lose their business. Acquirers of manufacturing and industrial firms may have suppliers of choice that do not include us, which could impact our customer base and market share. Certain of our operations are located outside of the United States, which subjects us to risks associated with international activities. Certain of our operations are located outside of the United States, primarily in Canada, China, and Mexico. We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making corrupt payments or otherwise corruptly giving anything of value to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment, and requires companies to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices. The FCPA applies to covered companies, individual directors, officers, employees, and agents. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for some actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives. If we or our intermediaries fail to 14 comply with the requirements of the FCPA, governmental authorities in the United States could seek to impose civil and/or criminal penalties. We may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations in the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar and the Chinese renminbi. We have significant operations in Canada which incur the majority of their metal supply costs in U.S. dollars but earn the majority of their sales in Canadian dollars. Additionally, we have significant assets in China. We may from time to time experience losses when the value of the U.S. dollar strengthens against the Canadian dollar or the Chinese renminbi, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, we are subject to translation risk when we consolidate our Canadian and Chinese subsidiaries’ net assets into our balance sheet. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar or Chinese renminbi could reduce the value of these assets as reported in our financial statements, which could, as a result, reduce our stockholders’ equity.The Chinese government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities, particularly with regards to the land our facilities are located on. The Chinese government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property, and other matters. We believe that our operations in China are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations. Moreover, the Chinese court system does not provide the same property and contract right guarantees as do courts in the United States and, accordingly, disputes may be protracted and resolution of claims may result in significant economic loss. Additionally, there is no private ownership of land in China and all land ownership is held by the government of China, its agencies, and collectives, which issue land use rights that are generally renewable. We lease the land where our Chinese facilities are located from the Chinese government. If the Chinese government decided to terminate our land use rights agreements, our assets could become impaired and our ability to meet customer orders could be impacted. Damage to our information technology infrastructure could harm our business. The unavailability of any of our computer-based systems for any significant period of time could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In particular, our ability to manage inventory levels successfully largely depends on the efficient operation of our computer hardware and software systems. We use management information systems to track inventory information at individual facilities, communicate customer information, and aggregate daily sales, margin, and promotional information. Difficulties associated with upgrades, installations of major software or hardware, and integration with new systems could have a material adverse effect on results of operations. We could be required to expend substantial resources to integrate our information systems with the systems of companies we have acquired. The integration of these systems may disrupt our business or lead to operating inefficiencies. In addition, these systems are vulnerable to, among other things, damage or interruption from fire, flood, tornado, and other natural disasters, power loss, computer system and network failures, operator negligence, physical and electronic loss of data, or security breaches and computer viruses. We are subject to cybersecurity risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks.We depend on the proper functioning and availability of our information technology platform, including communications and data processing systems, in operating our business. These systems include software programs that are integral to the efficient operation of our business. We have established security measures, controls, and procedures, including established recovery procedures for critical systems and business functions, to safeguard our information technology systems and to prevent unauthorized access to such systems and any data processed or stored in such systems, and we periodically evaluate and test the adequacy of such systems, measures, controls, and procedures; however, there can be no guarantee that such systems, measures, controls, and procedures will be effective. Security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of our information, litigation, and potential liability. In addition, cyber incidents that impact the availability, reliability, speed, accuracy, or other proper functioning of these systems could have a significant impact on our operations, and potentially on our results.  We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyberattacks. A significant cyber incident, including system failure, security breach, disruption by malware, or other damage could interrupt or delay our operations, result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, damage our reputation, cause a loss of customers, or give rise to monetary fines and other penalties, which could be significant.15 Any significant work stoppages can harm our business. As of December 31, 2019, we employed approximately 4,200 persons in North America and 300 persons in China. Our North American workforce was comprised of approximately 1,800 office employees and approximately 2,400 plant employees. Sixteen percent of our plant employees were members of various unions, including the United Steel Workers and The International Brotherhood of Teamsters.Renewals of four union contracts covering 89 employees were successfully negotiated in 2019. Nine union contracts covering 192 employees are currently scheduled to expire in 2020.Certain employee retirement benefit plans are underfunded and the actual cost of those benefits could exceed current estimates, which would require us to fund the shortfall. As of December 31, 2019, our pension plan had an unfunded liability of $140 million. Our actual costs for benefits required to be paid may exceed those projected and future actuarial assessments to the extent that those costs exceed the current assessment. Under those circumstances, the adjustments required to be made to our recorded liability for these benefits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and cash payments to fund these plans could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows. We may be required to make substantial future contributions to improve the plan’s funded status. Future funding for postretirement employee benefits other than pensions also may require substantial payments from current cash flow. We provide postretirement life insurance and medical benefits to certain eligible retired employees. Our unfunded postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2019 was $69 million. Our actual costs for benefits required to be paid may exceed those projected and future actuarial assessments to the extent that those costs exceed the current assessment. Under those circumstances, adjustments will be required to be made to our recorded liability for these benefits. Any prolonged disruption of our processing centers could harm our business. We have dedicated processing centers that permit us to produce standardized products in large volumes while maintaining low operating costs. We may suffer prolonged disruption in the operations of any of these facilities, whether due to labor or technical difficulties, destruction, or damage to any of the facilities or otherwise, which could adversely affect our operating results. If we are unable to retain, attract, and motivate management and key personnel, it may adversely affect our business. In order to compete and have continued growth, we must attract, retain, and motivate executives and other key employees, including those in managerial, technical, sales, marketing, and support positions. We believe that our success is due, in part, to our experienced management team. Losing the services of one or more members of our management team such as our CEO, Edward J. Lehner, could adversely affect our business and possibly prevent us from improving our operational, financial, and information management systems and controls. We compete to hire employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies. In the future, we may need to retain and hire additional qualified sales, marketing, administrative, operating, and technical personnel, and to train and manage new personnel. Our ability to implement our business plan is dependent on our ability to retain, hire, and train a large number of qualified employees each year. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover, or increased employee benefit costs.Our international operations and potential joint ventures may cause us to incur costs and risks that may distract management from effectively operating our North American business, and such operations or joint ventures may not be profitable. We maintain foreign operations in Canada, China, and Mexico. International operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business in, and with, foreign countries, including price controls, exchange controls, export controls, economic sanctions, duties, tariffs, limitations on participation in local enterprises, nationalization, expropriation and other governmental action, and changes in currency exchange rates. In addition, we may be subject to business disruptions created by health crises and outbreaks of communicable diseases, especially in China, including the recent outbreak of coronavirus. While we believe that our current arrangements with local partners provide us with experienced business partners in foreign countries, events or issues, including disagreements with our partners, may occur that require attention of our senior executives and may result in expenses or losses that erode the profitability of our foreign operations or cause our capital investments abroad to be unprofitable. 16 Lead time and the cost of our products could increase if we were to lose one of our primary suppliers. If, for any reason, our primary suppliers of aluminum, carbon steel, stainless steel, or other metals should curtail or discontinue their delivery of such metals in the quantities needed and at prices that are competitive, our business could suffer. The number of available suppliers could be reduced by factors such as industry consolidation and bankruptcies affecting steel and metal producers. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our top 25 suppliers represented approximately 71% of our purchases. We could be significantly and adversely affected if delivery were disrupted from a major supplier. If, in the future, we were unable to obtain sufficient amounts of the necessary metals at competitive prices and on a timely basis from our traditional suppliers, we may not be able to obtain such metals from alternative sources at competitive prices to meet our delivery schedules, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. Global metal overcapacity and imports of metal products into the United States have adversely affected, and may again adversely affect, United States metal prices, which could impact our sales and results of operations.Global metal production capacity currently exceeds global consumption of metal products. Such excess capacity sometimes results in metal manufacturers in certain countries exporting steel at prices that are lower than prevailing domestic prices and sometimes at or below their cost of production. Excessive imports of metal into the United States, such as in recent years, have exerted and may exert in the future, downward pressure on United States steel prices which may negatively affect our results of operations.The U.S. government enacted several trade actions in 2018 and 2019 including tariffs on imported steel and aluminum products under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. It is expected that these trade actions, while in effect, will limit metal imports from nonexempt countries. If these trade actions are relaxed, repealed, or if relatively higher U.S. metal prices make it attractive for foreign metal producers to export their products to the U.S., despite the presence of duties or tariffs, the resurgence of substantial imports of foreign steel could create downward pressure on U.S. metal prices which could have a material adverse effect on sales prices and future results of operations. To the extent these tariffs and other trade actions result in a decrease in international demand for steel and aluminum, or products manufactured therefrom and, produced in the United States, or otherwise negatively impact demand for our products, our business may be adversely impacted. We could incur substantial costs related to environmental, health, and safety laws. Our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental, health, and safety laws. These include laws that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and establish standards for the treatment, storage, and disposal of regulated materials, and the investigation and remediation of contaminated soil, surface water, and groundwater. Failure to maintain or achieve compliance with these laws or with the permits required for our operations could result in substantial increases in operating costs and capital expenditures. In addition, we may be subject to fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third party claims for property damage or personal injury, worker’s compensation or personal injury claims, cleanup costs, or temporary or permanent discontinuance of operations. Certain of our facilities are located in industrial areas, have a history of heavy industrial use, and have been in operation for many years and, over time, we and other predecessor operators of these facilities have generated, used, handled, and disposed of hazardous and other regulated wastes. Environmental liabilities could exist, including cleanup obligations at these facilities or at off-site locations where materials from our operations were disposed of, which could result in future expenditures that cannot be currently quantified and which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Such liabilities may be imposed without regard to fault or the legality of a party’s conduct and may, in certain circumstances, be joint and several. Future changes to environmental, health, and safety laws, including those related to climate change, could result in material liabilities and costs, constrain operations, or make such operations more costly for us, our suppliers, and our customers. In October 2011, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) named JT Ryerson as one of more than 100 businesses that may be a potentially responsible party for the Portland Harbor Superfund Site. See Item 3 “Legal Proceedings.” The EPA has not yet allocated responsibility for the contamination among the potentially responsible parties, including JT Ryerson. We do not currently have sufficient information available to us to determine whether the Record of Decision will be executed as currently stated, whether and to what extent JT Ryerson may be held responsible for any of the identified contamination, and how much (if any) of the final plan’s costs might ultimately be allocated to JT Ryerson. Therefore, management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or estimate a range of potential loss at this time.Regulations related to conflict-free minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and place us at a competitive disadvantage. On August 22, 2012, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), the United States SEC adopted new requirements for reporting companies that use certain minerals and metals, known as “conflict minerals”, in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. These requirements require companies to 17 diligence, disclose, and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to conclusively verify the origins for all metals used in our products and we may face reputational challenges with our customers. Additionally, as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering “conflict free” metals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary metals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Accordingly, we could incur significant cost related to the compliance process, including potential difficulty or added costs in satisfying the disclosure requirements. Moreover, we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.Tax changes could affect our effective tax rate, the value of our deferred tax assets, and future profitability.Our future results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate or changes in the treatment of deferred tax assets as a result of changes in Ryerson’s overall profitability, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax legislation, the results of the examination of previously filed tax returns, and continuing assessment of the Company’s tax exposures. In particular, although the passage of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 reduced the U.S. tax rate to 21%, our future earnings could be negatively impacted by changes in tax legislation including changing tax rates and tax base such as limiting, phasing-out, or eliminating deductions or tax credits, changing rules for earnings repatriations, and changing other tax laws in the U.S. or other countries. In addition, it is uncertain if, and to what extent, various states will conform to the new tax law and if foreign countries will react by adopting tax legislation or taking other actions that could adversely affect our business.We are subject to litigation that could strain our resources and distract management. From time to time, we are involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, and other disputes arising in the ordinary course of business. These suits concern issues including product liability, contract disputes, employee-related matters, and personal injury matters. It is not feasible to predict the outcome of all pending suits and claims, and the ultimate resolution of these matters as well as future lawsuits that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or reputation. We may face product liability claims that are costly and create adverse publicity. If any of the products that we sell cause harm to any of our customers, we could be exposed to product liability lawsuits. If we were found liable under product liability claims, we could be required to pay substantial monetary damages. Further, even if we successfully defended ourselves against this type of claim, we could be forced to spend a substantial amount of money in litigation expenses, our management could be required to spend valuable time in the defense against these claims, and our reputation could suffer.  Our risk management strategies may result in losses. From time to time, we may use fixed-price and/or fixed-volume supplier contracts to offset contracts with customers. Some of our existing supply agreements have required minimum purchase quantities. Under adverse economic conditions, those minimums may exceed our needs. Absent exceptions for force majeure and other circumstances affecting the legal enforceability of the agreements, these minimum purchase requirements may compel us to purchase quantities of raw materials that could significantly exceed our anticipated needs or pay damages to the supplier for shortfalls. In these circumstances, we would attempt to negotiate agreements for new purchase quantities. There is a risk, however, that we would not be successful in reducing purchase quantities, either through negotiation or litigation. If that occurred, we would likely be required to purchase more of a particular raw material in a particular year than we need, negatively affecting our results of operations and cash flows.Additionally, we may use commodity contracts, foreign exchange contracts, and interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk, and interest rate risk. These risk management strategies pose certain risks, including the risk that losses on a hedge position may exceed the amount invested in such instruments. Moreover, a party in a hedging transaction may be unavailable or unwilling to settle our obligations, which could cause us to suffer corresponding losses. A hedging instrument may not be effective in eliminating all of the risks inherent in any particular position. Our profitability may be adversely affected during any period as a result of use of such instruments.Changes in the method of determining the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest rates on our outstanding variable rate indebtedness.Certain of our variable rate debt, including the Ryerson Credit Facility, currently uses LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing certain interest rates. LIBOR is the subject of recent proposals for reform and on July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The Federal Reserve Bank 18 of New York has begun publishing a Secured Overnight Funding Rate (“SOFR”), which is intended to replace U.S. dollar LIBOR, and central banks in several other jurisdictions have also announced plans for alternative reference rates for other currencies. These reforms may cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or to disappear entirely. The consequences of these developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted but may result in an increase in the interest cost of our variable rate indebtedness. In the future, we may need to renegotiate our outstanding indebtedness or incur other indebtedness, and the phase-out of LIBOR may negatively impact the terms of such indebtedness. In addition, the overall financial market may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Disruption in the financial market could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common StockThe market price for our common stock may be volatile.Historically, there has been volatility in the market price for our common stock. Furthermore, the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in the future in response to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the risk factors described herein. Examples include: •changes in commodity prices, especially metals; •announcement of our quarterly operating results or the operating results of other metals service centers;  •changes in financial estimates or recommendations by stock market analysts regarding us or our competitors; •the operating and stock performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable; •press releases, earnings releases, or publicity relating to us or our competitors or relating to trends in the metals service center industry; •inability to meet securities analysts’ and investors’ quarterly or annual estimates or targets of our performance; •sales of our common stock by large or controlling shareholders; •the amount of shares acquired for short-term investments; •general domestic or international economic, market, and political conditions; and •announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, dispositions or joint ventures, or other material events impacting the domestic or global metals industry.In the past, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their specific operating performance. These factors may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of actual operating performance.In addition, stock markets from time to time experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. In the past, some shareholders have brought securities class action lawsuits against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. We may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation, regardless of whether our defense is ultimately successful, could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources.We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations. We currently have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2019, our total indebtedness was approximately $981.8 million and we had approximately $348 million of unused capacity under the Ryerson Credit Facility. Our substantial indebtedness may:  •make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our outstanding notes and our other indebtedness;  •limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes;  •limit our ability to use our cash flow for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes; 19  •require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;  •limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;  •place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and  •increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of the Ryerson Credit Facility and the indenture governing our outstanding notes restrict but do not prohibit us from doing so, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify. The covenants in the Ryerson Credit Facility and the indenture governing our notes impose, and covenants contained in agreements governing indebtedness that we incur in the future may impose, restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility. The Ryerson Credit Facility and the indenture governing our outstanding notes contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries, including JT Ryerson, to:  •incur additional debt;  •pay dividends on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock;  •make certain investments or other restricted payments;  •create liens or use assets as security in other transactions;  •merge, consolidate, transfer, or dispose of substantially all of our assets; and  •engage in transactions with affiliates. The terms of the Ryerson Credit Facility require that, in the event availability under the facility declines to a certain level, we maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter. Total credit availability is limited by the amount of eligible accounts receivable, inventory, and qualified cash pledged as collateral under the agreement insofar as the Company is subject to a borrowing base comprised of the aggregate of these three amounts, less applicable reserves. As of December 31, 2019, total credit availability was $348 million. See discussion regarding the Ryerson Credit Facility in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”Additionally, subject to certain exceptions, the indenture governing the outstanding notes restricts JT Ryerson’s ability to pay Ryerson Holding dividends. Our future indebtedness may contain covenants more restrictive in certain respects than the restrictions contained in the Ryerson Credit Facility and the indenture governing the notes. Operating results below current levels or other adverse factors, including a significant increase in interest rates, could result in our being unable to comply with financial covenants that are contained in the Ryerson Credit Facility or that may be contained in any future indebtedness. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to holders of our notes and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness. We are highly leveraged. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our outstanding notes, the Ryerson Credit Facility, and our other outstanding indebtedness are expected to account for significant cash interest expenses. Accordingly, we will have to generate significant cash flows from operations to meet our debt service requirements. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service and working capital requirements, we may be required to sell assets, seek additional capital, reduce capital expenditures, restructure or refinance all or a portion of our existing indebtedness, or seek additional financing. Moreover, insufficient cash flow may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. The right to receive payment on the 2022 Notes and the guarantees will be subordinated to the liabilities of non-guarantor subsidiaries.The notes and related guarantees are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness of our subsidiaries that are non-guarantors of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes (the “2022 Notes”). While the indenture governing the 2022 Notes limits the indebtedness and activities of these non-guarantor subsidiaries, holders of indebtedness of, and trade creditors of, non-guarantor subsidiaries, including 20 lenders under bank financing agreements, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before those assets are made available for distribution to any guarantor, as direct or indirect shareholder. While the non-guarantor subsidiaries have agreed under the indenture not to pledge or encumber their assets (other than with respect to permitted liens) without equally and ratably securing the notes, they will not guarantee the 2022 Notes notwithstanding any such pledge or encumbrance in favor of the 2022 Notes.The non-guarantor subsidiaries represented, respectively, 9.5% and 6.5% of our net sales and EBITDA for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, these non-guarantor subsidiaries represented respectively, 10.9% and 7.6% of our assets and liabilities, as of December 31, 2019.Accordingly, in the event that any of the non-guarantor subsidiaries or joint venture entities become insolvent, liquidates, or otherwise reorganizes: •the creditors of the guarantors (including the holders of the 2022 Notes) will have no right to proceed against such subsidiary’s assets; and  •the creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of assets of such subsidiary, as direct or indirect shareholder, and will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.Because a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain prevailing short-term interest rates, we are vulnerable to interest rate increases. A portion of our indebtedness, including the Ryerson Credit Facility, bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain short-term prevailing interest rates. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $377.7 million of outstanding borrowings under the Ryerson Credit Facility, with an additional $348 million available for borrowing under such facility. Assuming a consistent level of debt through-out 2019, a 100 basis point change in the interest rate on our floating rate debt effective from the beginning of the year would increase or decrease our interest expense under the Ryerson Credit Facility by approximately $2.6 million on an annual basis. If interest rates increase dramatically, we could be unable to service our debt, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Changes in our credit ratings and outlook may reduce access to capital and increase borrowing costs.Our credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and factors outside of our control, such as conditions affecting our industry generally or the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies. We cannot provide assurances that our current credit ratings will remain in effect or that the ratings will not be lowered, suspended, or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies. If rating agencies lower, suspend, or withdraw the ratings, the market price or marketability of our securities may be adversely affected. In addition, any negative change in ratings could make it more difficult for us to raise capital on acceptable terms, impact the ability to obtain adequate financing, and result in higher interest costs for our existing credit facilities, including the Ryerson Credit Facility, or on future financings.Platinum owns a significant percentage of our stock and has the right to nominate a majority of the members of the Corporation’s board and will be able to exert control over matters subject to stockholder approval.Platinum owns approximately 21,037,500 shares of our common stock, which is approximately 56% of our issued and outstanding common stock. Therefore, Platinum may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, Platinum may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that our stockholders may believe are in their best interest as stockholders.The Company is party to an investor rights agreement (the “Investor Rights Agreement”) with certain affiliates of Platinum which provides, among other things, that for so long as Platinum collectively beneficially owns (i) at least 30% of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the Company, Platinum will have the right to nominate for election to the board of directors of the Company no fewer than that number of directors that would constitute a majority of the number of directors if there were no vacancies on the board, (ii) at least 15% but less than 30% of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the Company, Platinum will have the right to nominate two directors, and (iii) at least 5% but less than 15% of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the Company, Platinum will have the right to nominate one director. The agreement also provides that if the size of the board of directors is increased or decreased at any time, Platinum’s nomination rights will be proportionately increased or decreased, respectively, rounded up to the nearest whole number. As a result of Platinum’s ownership of a majority of the Company’s outstanding capital stock as well its board nomination rights pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, Platinum may significantly 21 influence or effectively control our policies and operations, including the appointment of management, future issuances of our common stock or other securities, and the payment of dividends. In addition, Platinum has significant control over our decisions to enter into any other corporate transaction. The interests of Platinum may not in all cases be aligned with the interests of the other holders of our common stock. For example, a sale of a substantial number of shares of stock in the future by Platinum could cause our stock price to decline. Further, Platinum could cause us to make acquisitions that increase the amount of the indebtedness that is secured or senior to the Company’s existing debt or sell revenue-generating assets, impairing our ability to make payments under such debt. Additionally, Platinum is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Accordingly, Platinum may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, Platinum may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to holders of our common stock.We are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements because we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the NYSE rules and, as a result, our stockholders do not have the protections afforded by these corporate governance requirements.Because Platinum controls more than 50% of the voting power of our common stock, we are considered to be a “controlled company” for purposes of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) listing requirements. Under the NYSE rules, a “controlled company” may elect not to comply with certain NYSE corporate governance requirements, including (1) the requirement that a majority of our Board of Directors consist of independent directors, (2) the requirement that the nominating and corporate governance committee of our Board of Directors be composed entirely of independent directors, (3) the requirement that the compensation committee of our Board of Directors be composed entirely of independent directors, and (4) the requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nomination/corporate governance and compensation committees. Given that Platinum controls a majority of the voting power of our common stock, we are permitted, and have elected, to opt out of compliance with certain NYSE corporate governance requirements. Accordingly, holders of our common stock do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements.Our corporate documents and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of the Company.Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our Board of Directors. These provisions: •establish a classified Board of Directors so that not all members of our Board of Directors are elected at one time; •authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock; •provide that the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our amended and restated bylaws; •prohibit stockholders from acting by written consent if less than a majority of the voting power of our outstanding stock is controlled by Platinum; and •establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.Any issuance of preferred stock could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our common stock, which could depress the price of our common stock.Our Board of Directors will have the authority to issue preferred stock and to determine the preferences, limitations, and relative rights of shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Our preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend, and other rights superior to the rights of our common stock. The potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of us, discouraging bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price, and adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.22 We have not paid cash dividends since our initial public offering in 2014 and any future dividend payments are at the discretion of our Board of Directors.We have not declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock or any other equity security since our initial public offering in 2014. The amounts that may be available to us to pay cash dividends are restricted under our debt agreements. Any payment of cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, future prospects, contractual restrictions, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Therefore, you should not rely on dividend income from shares of our common stock. For more information, see “Dividend Policy.” Your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in us may be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and you sell your shares at a profit, but there is no guarantee that the market price for our common stock will ever exceed the price that you pay for our common stock"

Ryerson Holding Corporation (“Ryerson Holding”), a Delaware corporation, is the parent company of Joseph T. Ryerson & Son, Inc. (“JT Ryerson”), a Delaware corporation. Affiliates of Platinum Equity, LLC (“Platinum”) own approximately 21,037,500 shares of our common stock, which is approximately 56% of our issued and outstanding common stock. We are a leading metals service center, a value-added processor and distributor of industrial metals with operations in the United States through JT Ryerson, in Canada through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Ryerson Canada, Inc., a Canadian corporation (“Ryerson Canada”), and in Mexico through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Ryerson Metals de Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V., a Mexican corporation (“Ryerson Mexico”). In addition to our North American operations, we conduct materials processing and distribution operations in China through an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Ryerson China Limited (“Ryerson China”). Unless the context indicates otherwise, Ryerson Holding, JT Ryerson, Ryerson Canada, Ryerson China, and Ryerson Mexico together with their subsidiaries, are collectively referred to herein as “Ryerson,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company.” Our Company We believe we are one of the largest value-add processors and distributors of industrial metals in North America measured in terms of sales. Our industry is highly fragmented with the largest companies accounting for only a small percentage of total market share. Our customer base ranges from local, independently owned fabricators and machine shops to large, international original equipment manufacturers. We carry a full line of over 75,000 products in stainless steel, aluminum, carbon steel, and alloy steels and a limited line of nickel and red metals in various shapes and forms. More than 75% of the products we sell are processed to meet customer requirements. Specifically, we provide a wide range of flat and long metals products, we offer numerous value-added processing and fabrication services such as bending, beveling, blanking, blasting, burning, cutting-to-length, drilling, embossing, flattening, forming, grinding, laser cutting, machining, notching, painting, perforating, polishing, punching, rolling, sawing, scribing, shearing, slitting, stamping, tapping, threading, welding, or other techniques to process materials to a specified thickness, length, width, shape, and surface quality pursuant to specific customer orders. Our value proposition also includes providing a superior level of customer service and responsiveness, technical services, and inventory management solutions. Our range of products together with our breadth of services allows us to create long-term partnerships with our customers and enhances our profitability. We continue to focus on our systems and enhance our online services to provide increased functionality and flexibility to our customers. We track the processing, if any, performed on sold material for over 95% of our total revenues. The activities we track broadly fall into four main processing categories: (1) sheet processing (excludes fabrication activities), (2) as-is long and plate, (3) cut long and plate, and (4) fabrication.  A key metric that we track is the percentage mix of revenue that comes from our fabrication capabilities. In 2010, the mix of revenue from fabrication activities was 6.7% of our sales, while in 2018, our mix of revenue from fabrication activities was 10.2% of our sales largely due to the strategic investments we have made in value-added processing capital expenditures. On July 2, 2018, JT Ryerson acquired Central Steel and Wire Company (“CS&W”) a leading metal service center with locations across the Central and Eastern United States offering a wide selection of products and capabilities, with a commercial portfolio centered on bar, tube, plate, and steel products. We operate 97 facilities across North America and five facilities in China. Our service centers are strategically located near our customers, which allows us to quickly process and deliver our products and services, often within the next day of receiving an order. We own, lease, or contract a fleet of tractors and trailers, allowing us to efficiently meet our customers’ delivery demands. In addition, our scale enables us to maintain low operating costs. Our operating expenses as a percentage of sales for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were 14.0% and 14.3%, respectively. We serve approximately 45,000 customers across a wide range of manufacturing end markets. Our geographic network and broad range of products and services allow us to serve large, international manufacturing companies across multiple locations. We believe the diverse end markets we serve reduce the volatility of our business in the aggregate.Industry Overview Metals service centers serve as key intermediaries between metal producers and end users of metal products. Metal producers offer commodity products and typically sell metals in the form of standard-sized coils, sheets, plates, structurals, bars, and tubes. Producers, mostly steel and aluminum mills, prefer large order quantities, longer lead times, and limited inventory to maximize capacity utilization across their typically higher capital-intensive structure. 4 End users of metal products seek to purchase metals with customized specifications, including value-added processing. End-users in highly diverse industries such as machinery, construction, and transportation often look for “one-stop” suppliers that can offer processing services along with lower order volumes, shorter lead times, and more reliable delivery. As an intermediary, metals service centers aggregate end-users’ demand, purchase metal in bulk to take advantage of economies of scale, and then process and sell metal that meets specific customer requirements. The metals service center industry is comprised of many companies, the majority of which have limited product lines and inventories, with customers located in a specific geographic area. In general, competition is based on quality, service, price, and geographic proximity. The metals service center industry typically experiences cash flow trends that are counter-cyclical to the revenue and volume growth of the industry. During an industry downturn, companies generally reduce working capital assets and generate cash as inventory and accounts receivable balances decline. As a result, operating cash flow and liquidity tend to increase during a downturn, which typically facilitates industry participants’ ability to cover fixed costs and repay outstanding debt. We compete with many other metals service centers and to a lesser extent with primary metal producers. Primary metal producers typically sell to larger customers that require regular shipments of higher volumes of steel than the traditional service center customer. Competitive Strengths Leading Market Position in North America. Based on sales, we believe we are one of the largest service center companies for carbon, stainless steel, and aluminum in the North American market where we have a broad geographic presence with 97 facilities. Our service centers are located near our customer locations, enabling us to provide timely delivery to customers across numerous geographic markets. Additionally, our widespread network of locations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico helps us to utilize our expertise to more efficiently serve customers with complex supply chain requirements across multiple manufacturing locations. We believe this is a key differentiator for customers who need a supplier that can reliably and consistently support them. Our ability to transfer inventory among our facilities better enables us to more timely and profitably source and process specialized items at regional locations throughout our network than if we were required to maintain inventory of all products and specialized equipment at each location. Broad Geographic Reach Across Attractive End Markets. Our operations serve a diverse range of industries including commercial ground transportation manufacturing, metal fabrication and machine shops, industrial machinery and equipment manufacturing, consumer durable equipment, HVAC manufacturing, construction equipment manufacturing, food processing and agricultural equipment manufacturing, and oil and gas. We believe this broad range of industries in which we sell our products and services reduces our risk related to a downturn in a specific industry. We believe that our ability to quickly adjust our offering based on regional and industry specific trends creates stability while also providing the opportunity to access specific growth markets. Established Platform for Organic and Acquisition Growth. Although there can be no guarantee of growth, we believe a number of our strategies, such as investing in value-added processing capabilities, analytically targeting attractive customers and end markets with our supply chain optimization service model, industry consolidation through targeted M&A, and providing customers faster and easier solutions to their metal needs will provide us with growth opportunities. Given the highly fragmented nature of the metals service center industry, we believe there are numerous additional opportunities to acquire businesses and incorporate them into our existing infrastructure. Given our large scale and geographic reach, we believe we can add value to these businesses in a number of ways, including providing greater purchasing power, improving expense and working capital management, access to additional end markets, and broadening product mix. 5 Lean Operating Structure Providing Operating Leverage. Ryerson has demonstrated the ability to effectively manage expenses through tactical productivity and spending improvements.  In a stronger metals service center environment characterized by increases in demand and/or pricing, we believe that most additional expenses to service higher revenue and margins would come from variable expenses while further leveraging economies of scale on our existing fixed expenses. We effectively managed our costs in 2018 with increased volume and cost inflation, as expenses as a percentage of sales declined from 14.3% in 2017 to 14.0% in 2018.  We also continue to focus on inventory management. Average inventory days excluding LIFO increased from 71 days in 2017 to 73 days in 2018. This increase is due to the acquisition of CS&W in July 2018. On a same-store basis, days of supply remained at 71 days, within management’s target range of 70 to 75 days.  As a result of our initiatives, we maintain financial flexibility and believe we have a favorable cost structure compared to many of our peers. Extensive Breadth of Products and Services for Diverse Customer Base. We believe our broad product mix and marketing approach provides customers with a “one-stop shop” solution few other metals service center companies are able to offer. We provide a broad range of processing and fabrication services to meet the needs of our approximately 45,000 customers and typically fulfill more than 1,500,000 orders per year. We provide supply chain solutions, including just-in-time delivery and value-added processing to many original equipment manufacturing customers. For the year ended December 31, 2018, no single customer, including their subcontractors, accounted for more than 6% of our sales, and our top 10 customers, including their subcontractors accounted for less than 15% of our sales. Strong Relationships with Suppliers. We are among the largest purchasers of metals in North America and have long-term relationships with many of our North American suppliers. We believe we are frequently one of the largest customers of our suppliers and that concentrating our orders among a core group of suppliers is effective for obtaining favorable pricing and service. We believe we have the opportunity to further leverage this strength through continued focus on price and volume using an analytics-driven approach to procurement. In addition, we view our strategic suppliers as supply chain partners. We focus on logistics, lead times, rolling schedules, and scrap return programs to drive value-based buying that is advantageous for us. Metals producers worldwide are consolidating, and large, geographically diversified customers, such as Ryerson, are desirable partners for these larger suppliers. Our relationships with suppliers often provide us with access to metals when supply is constrained. Through our knowledge of the global metals marketplace and capabilities of specific mills we believe we have developed an advantageous global purchasing strategy. Experienced Management Team with Deep Industry Knowledge. Our senior management team has extensive industry and operational experience and has been instrumental in optimizing and implementing our strategy over the last five years. Our senior management has an average of more than 20 years of experience in the metals or service center industries. Our CEO, Mr. Edward Lehner, who joined the Company in August 2012 as CFO and became CEO in June 2015, has nearly 30 years of experience, predominantly in the metals industry. Mr. Erich Schnaufer, who joined the Company in 2005 and became CFO in January 2016, has nearly 30 years of financial and accounting experience and over 10 years with Ryerson. Industry Outlook The United States economy has grown since the recession of 2008. According to the Institute for Supply Management, the Purchasing Managers’ Index (“PMI”) was above 50% for 33 of the last 36 months, indicating general expansion in the U.S. manufacturing economy for the last three years. The PMI measures the economic health of the manufacturing sector and is a composite index based on five indicators: new orders, inventory levels, production, supplier deliveries, and the employment environment. PMI readings can be a good indicator of industrial activity and general economic growth. Additionally, the overall U.S. economy is projected to maintain growth as evidenced by the Federal Reserve’s midrange forecasted real GDP growth rates of 2.5%, 2.0%, and 1.8% for 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively. Steel demand in North America is largely dependent on growth of the automotive, industrial equipment, consumer appliance, and construction end markets. One of our key end markets is the industrial equipment sector, and according to the latest Livingston Survey, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, U.S. industrial production expanded by 3.8% in 2018 and is expected to grow by 2.9% in 2019, and 2.0% in 2020. 6 China continues to be a key driver in the growth of global metals demand. According to the International Monetary Fund, China’s GDP maintained growth of 6.6% in 2018 and is projected to grow 6.2% in 2019, and 6.2% in 2020.Products and Services We carry a full line of carbon steel, stainless steel, alloy steels, and aluminum, and a limited line of nickel and red metals. These materials are stocked in a number of shapes, including coils, sheets, rounds, hexagons, square and flat bars, plates, structurals, and tubing. The following table shows our percentage of sales by major product lines for 2018, 2017, and 2016:  Product Line 2018  2017  2016 Carbon Steel Flat  27%  28%  28%Carbon Steel Plate  11   10   9 Carbon Steel Long  14   12   13 Stainless Steel Flat  16   18   17 Stainless Steel Plate  4   4   4 Stainless Steel Long  4   4   3 Aluminum Flat  15   15   16 Aluminum Plate  3   3   3 Aluminum Long  4   4   5 Other  2   2   2 Total  100%  100%  100%More than 75% of the materials sold by us are processed. We use processing and fabricating techniques such as bending, beveling, blanking, blasting, burning, cutting-to-length, drilling, embossing, flattening, forming, grinding, laser cutting, machining, notching, painting, perforating, polishing, punching, rolling, sawing, scribing, shearing, slitting, stamping, tapping, threading, welding, or other techniques to process materials to specified thickness, length, width, shape, and surface quality pursuant to specific customer orders. Among the most common processing techniques used by us are slitting, which involves cutting coiled metals to specified widths along the length of the coil, and leveling, which involves flattening coiled metals and cutting them to exact lengths. We also use third-party fabricators to outsource certain processes (such as pickling and other coating processes or heat treating). The plate burning and fabrication processes are particularly important to us. These processes require sophisticated and expensive processing equipment. As a result, rather than making investments in such equipment, manufacturers have increasingly outsourced these processes to metals service centers. As part of securing customer orders, we also provide services to our customers to assure cost effective material application while maintaining or improving the customers’ product quality. Among our services are: just-in-time inventory programs, production of configured kits containing multiple custom products for ease of assembly by the customer, consignment arrangements, and the placement of our employees at a customer’s site for inventory management and production and technical assistance. We also provide special stocking programs in which products that would not otherwise be stocked by us are held in inventory to meet certain customers’ needs. These services are designed to reduce customers’ costs by minimizing their investment in inventory and processing equipment and improving their production efficiency. 7 Customers Our customer base is diverse, numbering approximately 45,000 and including most metal-consuming industries, most of which are cyclical. For the year ended December 31, 2018, no customer, including their subcontractors, accounted for more than 6 percent of our sales, and the top 10 customers, including their subcontractors, accounted for less than 15 percent of our sales. Substantially all of our sales are attributable to our U.S. operations and substantially all of our long-lived assets are located in the United States. The following table shows the Company’s percentage of sales by metal consuming industry for 2018, 2017, and 2016:    Percentage of Sales Metal Consuming Industry 2018  2017  2016 Metal fabrication and machine shops  22%  20%  18%Industrial machinery and equipment  18   18   18 Commercial ground transportation  16   16   16 Consumer durable  11   11   11 Food processing and agricultural equipment  10   10   9 Construction equipment  8   9   9 HVAC  6   7   7 Oil & gas  5   5   5 Other  4   4   7 Total  100%  100%  100% Some of our largest customers have procurement programs with us, typically ranging from three months to one year in duration. Pricing for these contracts is generally based on a pricing formula rather than a fixed price for the program duration. However, certain customer contracts are at fixed prices; to minimize our financial exposure, we generally match these fixed-price sales programs with fixed-price supply programs. In general, sales to customers are priced at the time of sale based on prevailing market prices.Suppliers For the year ended December 31, 2018, our top 25 suppliers, including their subcontractors, accounted for approximately 74% of our purchase dollars. We purchase the majority of our inventories at prevailing market prices from key suppliers with which we have established relationships to obtain improvements in price, quality, delivery, and service. We are generally able to meet our materials requirements because we use many suppliers, there is a substantial overlap of product offerings from these suppliers, and there are several other suppliers able to provide identical or similar products. Because of the competitive nature of the business, when metal prices increase due to product demand, mill surcharges, input costs, supplier consolidation, or other factors that in turn lead to supply constraints or longer mill lead times and higher procured material costs, we may not be able to fully pass increased material costs to customers. In recent decades, there have been significant consolidations among suppliers of carbon steel, stainless steel, and aluminum. We believe we will be able to meet our material requirements and believe we will continue to be among the largest customers of our suppliers. Sales and Marketing We maintain our own professional sales force. In addition to our office sales staff, we market and sell our products through the use of our field sales force that we believe has extensive product and customer knowledge and offers a comprehensive catalog of our products. Our office and field sales staffs, which together consist of approximately 790 employees, include technical personnel. A portion of our customers experience seasonal slowdowns. Our sales, as measured in tonnage sold, in the months of July, November, and December traditionally have been lower than in other months because of a reduced number of shipping days and holiday or vacation closures for some customers. Consequently, our sales in the first two quarters of the year are usually higher than in the third and fourth quarters. 8 Capital Expenditures We continue to make capital investments to maintain, improve, and expand processing capabilities. Investments by us in property, plant, and equipment, together with asset retirements for the five years ended December 31, 2018, excluding the initial purchase price of acquisitions are set forth below. The net capital change during such period aggregated to an increase of $79.6 million.    Additions  Retirementsor Sales  Net   (In millions) 2018 $38.4  $5.5  $32.9 2017  25.1   24.9   0.2 2016  23.0   5.0   18.0 2015  22.3   9.1   13.2 2014  21.6   6.3   15.3  We currently anticipate capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, of up to approximately $35 million for 2019. We expect capital expenditures will be funded from cash generated by operations and available borrowings. Employees As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 4,300 persons in North America and 300 persons in China. Our North American workforce was comprised of approximately 1,800 office employees and approximately 2,500 plant employees. Sixteen percent of our plant employees were members of various unions, including the United Steel Workers and The International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Renewals of six union contracts covering approximately 107 employees were successfully negotiated in 2018. Four contracts covering 89 employees are currently scheduled to expire in 2019.Environmental, Health, and Safety Matters Our facilities and operations are subject to many foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and to health and safety. In particular, our operations are subject to extensive requirements relating to waste disposal, recycling, air and water emissions, the handling of regulated materials, remediation, underground storage tanks, asbestos-containing building materials, workplace exposure, and other matters. We believe that our operations are currently in substantial compliance with all such laws and do not presently anticipate substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future in order to meet environmental, workplace health or safety requirements, or to pay for any investigations, corrective action, or claims. Claims, enforcement actions, or investigations regarding personal injury, property damage, or violation of environmental laws could result in substantial costs to us, divert our management’s attention, and result in significant liabilities, fines, or the suspension or interruption of our facilities. We continue to analyze and implement safeguards to mitigate any environmental, health, and safety risks we may face. As a result, additional costs and liabilities may be incurred to comply with future requirements or to address newly discovered conditions, and these costs and liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. For example, there is increasing likelihood that additional regulation of greenhouse gas emissions will occur at the foreign, federal, state, and local level, which could affect us, our suppliers, and our customers. While the costs of compliance could be significant, given the uncertain outcome and timing of future action by the U.S. federal government and states on this issue, we cannot accurately predict the financial impact of future greenhouse gas regulations on our operations or our customers at this time. We do not currently anticipate any new programs disproportionately impacting us compared to our competitors. Some of the properties currently or previously owned or leased by us are located in industrial areas or have a long history of heavy industrial use. We may incur environmental liabilities with respect to these properties in the future including costs of investigations, corrective action, claims for natural resource damages, claims by third parties relating to property damages, or claims relating to contamination at sites where we have sent waste for treatment or disposal. Based on currently available information we do not expect any investigation, remediation matters, or claims related to properties presently or formerly owned, operated, or to which we have sent waste for treatment or disposal would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 9 In October 2011, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) named us as one of more than 100 businesses that may be a potentially responsible party for the Portland Harbor Superfund Site (the “PHS Site”). On January 6, 2017, the EPA issued an initial Record of Decision (“ROD”) regarding the site. The ROD includes a combination of dredging, capping, and enhanced natural recovery that would take approximately thirteen years to construct plus additional time for monitored natural recovery, at an estimated present value cost of $1.05 billion. At a meeting on December 4, 2018, the EPA announced that it expects parties to submit a plan to remediate the river and harbor per the original ROD within the next 2-3 years. It also expects allocation of amounts among the parties to be determined in the same time frame. It is willing to consider de minimus and de micromis settlements but is unlikely to approve any before completion of the remedial design process.The EPA has not yet allocated responsibility for the contamination among the potentially responsible parties, including JT Ryerson. We do not currently have sufficient information available to us to determine whether the ROD will be executed as currently stated, whether and to what extent JT Ryerson may be held responsible for any of the identified contamination, and how much (if any) of the final plan’s costs might ultimately be allocated to JT Ryerson. Therefore, management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or estimate a range of potential loss at this time. Excluding any potential additional remediation costs resulting from any corrective action for the properties described above, we expect spending for pollution control projects to remain at historical levels below $500,000 per year. Our United States operations are also subject to the Department of Transportation Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations. We operate a private trucking motor fleet for making deliveries to some of our customers. Our drivers do not carry any material quantities of hazardous materials. Our foreign operations are subject to similar regulations. Future regulations could increase maintenance, replacement, and fuel costs for our fleet. These costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. Intellectual Property We own several U.S. and foreign trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Certain of the trademarks are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and, in certain circumstances, with the trademark offices of various foreign countries. We consider certain other information owned by us to be trade secrets. We protect our trade secrets by, among other things, entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees regarding such matters and implementing measures to restrict access to sensitive data and computer software source code on a need-to-know basis. We believe that these safeguards adequately protect our proprietary rights and we vigorously defend these rights. While we consider all our intellectual property rights as a whole to be important, we do not consider any single right to be essential to our operations as a whole.    Available Information All periodic and current reports and other filings that we are required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are available free of charge from the SEC’s website (www.sec.gov) or through our Investor Relations website at www.ir.ryerson.com.

You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the other information in this report, including the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors below will not occur. These risks could have a material and adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Risks Related to Our Business and IndustryWeakness in the economy, market trends, and other conditions affecting the profitability and financial stability of our customers could negatively impact our sales growth and results of operations. Economic and industry trends affect our business environments. We serve several industries in which the demand for our products and services is sensitive to the production activity, capital spending, and demand for products and services of our customers. Many of these customers operate in markets that are subject to highly cyclical fluctuations resulting from seasonality, market uncertainty, costs of goods sold, currency exchange rates, foreign competition, offshoring of production, oil and natural gas prices, geopolitical developments, and a variety of other factors beyond our control. Any of these factors could cause customers to idle or close facilities, delay purchases, reduce production levels, or experience reductions in the demand for their own products or services.Any of these events could impair the ability of our customers to make full and timely payments or reduce the volume of products and services these customers purchase from us and could cause increased pressure on our selling prices and terms of sale. We do not expect the cyclical nature of our industry to change and any downturn in our customers’ industries could reduce our revenues and profitability or a significant or prolonged slowdown in activity in the United States (U.S.), Canada, or any other major world economy, or a segment of any such economy, could negatively impact our sales growth and results of operations.The metals services business is very competitive and increased competition could reduce our revenues and gross margins.  The metals services industry is highly fragmented and competitive, consisting of a large number of small companies and a few relatively large companies. We face competition in all markets we serve. Competition is based principally on price, service, quality, production capabilities, inventory availability, and timely delivery. Competition in the various markets in which we participate comes from companies of various sizes, some of which have greater financial resources than we have and some of which have more established brand names in the local markets we serve. Increased competition could reduce our market share, force us to lower our prices, or to offer increased services at a higher cost, which could reduce our profitability. Changing metals prices may have a significant impact on our liquidity, net sales, gross margins, operating income, and net income. The metals services industry as a whole is cyclical and, at times, pricing and availability of metal can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control, including general domestic and international economic conditions, labor costs, sales levels, competition, levels of inventory held by other metals service centers, consolidation of metals producers, higher raw material costs for the producers of metals, import duties and tariffs, and currency exchange rates. This volatility can significantly affect the availability and cost of materials for us. Our ability to pass on increases in costs in a timely manner depends on market conditions and may result in lower gross margins. We maintain substantial inventories of metal to accommodate the short lead times and just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers. Accordingly, we purchase metals in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon historic buying practices, contracts with customers, and market conditions. When metals prices decline, customer demands for lower prices and our competitors’ responses to those demands result in lower sale prices and, consequently, lower margins as we use existing metals inventory. Declines in prices or further reductions in sales volumes could adversely impact our ability to maintain our liquidity and to remain in compliance with certain financial covenants under our $1 billion revolving credit facility (the “Ryerson Credit Facility”), as well as result in us incurring inventory or goodwill impairment charges. Changing metals prices therefore could significantly impact our liquidity, net sales, gross margins, operating income, and net income. 11 Changes in inflation may adversely affect gross margins. Inflation impacts the costs at which we can procure product and the ability to increase prices to customers over time. Prolonged periods of deflation could adversely affect the degree to which we are able to increase sales through price increases.Unexpected product shortages could negatively impact customer relationships, resulting in an adverse impact on results of operations. Disruptions could occur due to factors beyond our control, including economic downturns, political unrest, port slowdowns, trade issues, including increased export or import duties or trade restrictions, and other factors, any of which could adversely affect a supplier’s ability to manufacture or deliver products. For our sources of lower cost products from Asia and other areas of the world, the risk for disruptions has increased due to the additional lead time required and distances involved, and the current political climate seeking trade reform. If we were to experience difficulty in obtaining products, there could be a short-term adverse effect on results of operations and a longer-term adverse effect on customer relationships and our reputation. In addition, we have strategic relationships with a number of vendors. In the event we are unable to maintain those relations, there might be a loss of competitive pricing advantages which could, in turn, adversely affect results of operations.Changes in customer or product mix could cause the gross margin percentage to decline. From time to time, we experience changes in customer and product mix that affect gross margin. Changes in customer and product mix result primarily from business acquisitions, changes in customer demand, customer acquisitions, selling and marketing activities, and competition. If rapid growth with lower margin customers occurs, we will face pressure to maintain current gross margins, as these customers receive more discounted pricing due to their higher sales volume. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain historical gross margins in the future.The volatility of the market could result in a material impairment of goodwill. We evaluate goodwill annually on October 1 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment. Events or changes in circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to our historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner or the use of our assets or the strategy for our overall business, and significant negative industry or economic trends. We test for impairment of goodwill by assessing various qualitative factors with respect to development in our business and the overall economy and calculating the fair value of a reporting unit using a combination of an income approach based on discounted future cash flows and a market approach at the date of valuation. Under the discounted cash flow method, the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated based on expected future economic benefits discounted to a present value at a rate of return commensurate with the risk associated with the investment. Projected cash flows are discounted to present value using an estimated weighted average cost of capital, which considers both returns to equity and debt investors. Please refer to the Section titled “Critical Accounting Estimates - Goodwill,” of Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations,” and Note 1 — “Summary of Accounting and Financial Policies” of Part II, Item 8 ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" for further information.We may not be able to successfully consummate and complete the integration of future acquisitions, and if we are unable to do so, it could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs and/or decreases in revenues and results of operations. We have grown through a combination of internal expansion, acquisitions, and joint ventures. We intend to continue to grow through selective acquisitions, but we may not be able to identify appropriate acquisition candidates, obtain financing on satisfactory terms, consummate acquisitions, or integrate acquired businesses effectively and profitably into our existing operations. Restrictions contained in the agreements governing our notes, the Ryerson Credit Facility, or our other existing or future debt may also inhibit our ability to make certain investments, including acquisitions, and participations in joint ventures. Acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures, and other business combination transactions, both foreign and domestic, involve various inherent risks, such as uncertainties in assessing value, strengths, weaknesses, liabilities, and potential profitability. There is also risk relating to our ability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from the transactions. Additionally, problems could arise from the integration of acquired businesses, including unanticipated changes in the business or industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition. Our future success will depend on our ability to complete the integration of these future acquisitions successfully into our operations. Specifically, after any acquisition, customers may choose to diversify their supply chains to reduce reliance on a single supplier for a portion of their metals needs. We may not be able to retain all of our and an acquisition’s customers, which may adversely affect our business and sales. Integrating acquisitions, particularly large acquisitions, requires us to enhance our operational and financial systems and employ additional qualified personnel, management, and financial resources, and may adversely affect our business by diverting management away from 12 day-to-day operations. Further, failure to successfully integrate acquisitions may adversely affect our profitability by creating significant operating inefficiencies that could increase our operating expenses as a percentage of sales and reduce our operating income. In addition, we may not realize expected cost savings from acquisitions. Any one or more of these factors could cause us to not realize the benefits anticipated or have a negative impact on the fair value of the reporting units. Accordingly, goodwill and intangible assets recorded as a result of acquisitions could become impaired.We may not be able to retain or expand our customer base if the North American manufacturing industry continues to erode through moving offshore or through acquisition and merger or consolidation activity in our customers’ industries. Our customer base primarily includes manufacturing and industrial firms. Some of our customers operate in industries that are undergoing consolidation through acquisition and merger activity; some are considering or have considered relocating production operations overseas or outsourcing particular functions overseas; and some customers have closed as they were unable to compete successfully with overseas competitors. Our facilities are predominately located in the United States and Canada. To the extent that our customers cease U.S. operations, relocate or move operations overseas to regions in which we do not have a presence, we could lose their business. Acquirers of manufacturing and industrial firms may have suppliers of choice that do not include us, which could impact our customer base and market share. Certain of our operations are located outside of the United States, which subjects us to risks associated with international activities. Certain of our operations are located outside of the United States, primarily in Canada, China, and Mexico. We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making corrupt payments or otherwise corruptly giving any thing of value to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment, and requires companies to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices. The FCPA applies to covered companies, individual directors, officers, employees, and agents. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for some actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives. If we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA, governmental authorities in the United States could seek to impose civil and/or criminal penalties. We may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations in the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar and the Chinese renminbi. We have significant operations in Canada which incur the majority of their metal supply costs in U.S. dollars but earn the majority of their sales in Canadian dollars. Additionally, we have significant assets in China. We may from time to time experience losses when the value of the U.S. dollar strengthens against the Canadian dollar or the Chinese renminbi, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, we are subject to translation risk when we consolidate our Canadian and Chinese subsidiaries’ net assets into our balance sheet. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar or Chinese renminbi could reduce the value of these assets as reported in our financial statements, which could, as a result, reduce our stockholders’ equity.The Chinese government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities, particularly with regards to the land our facilities are located on. The Chinese government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property, and other matters. We believe that our operations in China are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations. Moreover, the Chinese court system does not provide the same property and contract right guarantees as do courts in the United States and, accordingly, disputes may be protracted and resolution of claims may result in significant economic loss. Additionally, there is no private ownership of land in China and all land ownership is held by the government of China, its agencies, and collectives, which issue land use rights that are generally renewable. We lease the land where our Chinese facilities are located from the Chinese government. If the Chinese government decided to terminate our land use rights agreements, our assets could become impaired and our ability to meet customer orders could be impacted. Damage to our information technology infrastructure could harm our business. The unavailability of any of our computer-based systems for any significant period of time could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In particular, our ability to manage inventory levels successfully largely depends on the efficient operation of our 13 computer hardware and software systems. We use management information systems to track inventory information at individual facilities, communicate customer information, and aggregate daily sales, margin, and promotional information. Difficulties associated with upgrades, installations of major software or hardware, and integration with new systems could have a material adverse effect on results of operations. We could be required to expend substantial resources to integrate our information systems with the systems of companies we have acquired. The integration of these systems may disrupt our business or lead to operating inefficiencies. In addition, these systems are vulnerable to, among other things, damage or interruption from fire, flood, tornado, and other natural disasters, power loss, computer system and network failures, operator negligence, physical and electronic loss of data, or security breaches and computer viruses. We are subject to cybersecurity risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks.We depend on the proper functioning and availability of our information technology platform, including communications and data processing systems, in operating our business. These systems include software programs that are integral to the efficient operation of our business. We have established security measures, controls, and procedures, including established recovery procedures for critical systems and business functions, to safeguard our information technology systems and to prevent unauthorized access to such systems and any data processed or stored in such systems, and we periodically evaluate and test the adequacy of such systems, measures, controls, and procedures; however, there can be no guarantee that such systems, measures, controls, and procedures will be effective. Security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of our information, litigation, and potential liability. In addition, cyber incidents that impact the availability, reliability, speed, accuracy, or other proper functioning of these systems could have a significant impact on our operations, and potentially on our results.  We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyberattacks. A significant cyber incident, including system failure, security breach, disruption by malware, or other damage could interrupt or delay our operations, result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, damage our reputation, cause a loss of customers, or give rise to monetary fines and other penalties, which could be significant.Any significant work stoppages can harm our business. As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 4,300 persons in North America and 300 persons in China. Our North American workforce was comprised of approximately 1,800 office employees and approximately 2,500 plant employees. Sixteen percent of our plant employees were members of various unions, including the United Steel Workers and The International Brotherhood of Teamsters.Renewals of six union contracts covering approximately 107 employees were successfully negotiated in 2018. Four union contracts covering 89 employees are currently scheduled to expire in 2019.Certain employee retirement benefit plans are underfunded and the actual cost of those benefits could exceed current estimates, which would require us to fund the shortfall. As of December 31, 2018, our pension plan had an unfunded liability of $181 million. Our actual costs for benefits required to be paid may exceed those projected and future actuarial assessments to the extent that those costs exceed the current assessment. Under those circumstances, the adjustments required to be made to our recorded liability for these benefits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and cash payments to fund these plans could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows. We may be required to make substantial future contributions to improve the plan’s funded status. Future funding for postretirement employee benefits other than pensions also may require substantial payments from current cash flow. We provide postretirement life insurance and medical benefits to certain eligible retired employees. Our unfunded postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2018 was $70 million. Our actual costs for benefits required to be paid may exceed those projected and future actuarial assessments to the extent that those costs exceed the current assessment. Under those circumstances, adjustments will be required to be made to our recorded liability for these benefits. Any prolonged disruption of our processing centers could harm our business. We have dedicated processing centers that permit us to produce standardized products in large volumes while maintaining low operating costs. We may suffer prolonged disruption in the operations of any of these facilities, whether due to labor or technical difficulties, destruction, or damage to any of the facilities or otherwise. 14 If we are unable to retain, attract, and motivate management and key personnel, it may adversely affect our business. In order to compete and have continued growth, we must attract, retain, and motivate executives and other key employees, including those in managerial, technical, sales, marketing, and support positions. We believe that our success is due, in part, to our experienced management team. Losing the services of one or more members of our management team such as our CEO, Edward J. Lehner, and CFO, Erich S. Schnaufer, could adversely affect our business and possibly prevent us from improving our operational, financial, and information management systems and controls. We compete to hire employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies. In the future, we may need to retain and hire additional qualified sales, marketing, administrative, operating, and technical personnel, and to train and manage new personnel. Our ability to implement our business plan is dependent on our ability to retain, hire, and train a large number of qualified employees each year. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover, or increased employee benefit costs.Our international operations and potential joint ventures may cause us to incur costs and risks that may distract management from effectively operating our North American business, and such operations or joint ventures may not be profitable. We maintain foreign operations in Canada, China, and Mexico. International operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business in, and with, foreign countries, including price controls, exchange controls, export controls, economic sanctions, duties, tariffs, limitations on participation in local enterprises, nationalization, expropriation and other governmental action, and changes in currency exchange rates. While we believe that our current arrangements with local partners provide us with experienced business partners in foreign countries, events or issues, including disagreements with our partners, may occur that require attention of our senior executives and may result in expenses or losses that erode the profitability of our foreign operations or cause our capital investments abroad to be unprofitable. Lead time and the cost of our products could increase if we were to lose one of our primary suppliers. If, for any reason, our primary suppliers of aluminum, carbon steel, stainless steel, or other metals should curtail or discontinue their delivery of such metals in the quantities needed and at prices that are competitive, our business could suffer. The number of available suppliers could be reduced by factors such as industry consolidation and bankruptcies affecting steel and metal producers. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our top 25 suppliers represented approximately 74% of our purchases. We could be significantly and adversely affected if delivery were disrupted from a major supplier. If, in the future, we were unable to obtain sufficient amounts of the necessary metals at competitive prices and on a timely basis from our traditional suppliers, we may not be able to obtain such metals from alternative sources at competitive prices to meet our delivery schedules, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. Global metal overcapacity and imports of metal products into the United States have adversely affected, and may again adversely affect, United States metal prices, which could impact our sales and results of operations.Global metal production capacity currently exceeds global consumption of metal products. Such excess capacity sometimes results in metal manufacturers in certain countries exporting steel at prices that are lower than prevailing domestic prices and sometimes at or below their cost of production. Excessive imports of metal into the United States, such as in recent years, have exerted and may continue to exert, downward pressure on United States steel prices which negatively affects our ability to increase our sales and results of operations.The U.S. government has enacted several trade actions in 2018 including tariffs on imported steel and aluminum products under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. It is expected that these trade actions, while in effect, will limit metal imports from non-exempt countries. These trade actions have favorably impacted Ryerson’s average selling prices and gross margins in 2018. If these trade actions are relaxed, repealed, or if relatively higher U.S. metal prices make it attractive for foreign metal producers to export their products to the U.S., despite the presence of duties or tariffs, the resurgence of substantial imports of foreign steel could create downward pressure on U.S. metal prices which could have a material adverse effect on sales prices and future results of operations. Further, foreign administrations have responded to the trade actions imposed by the U.S. with trade actions in kind, adding further uncertainty to U.S. pricing and supply conditions. To the extent these tariffs and other trade actions result in a decrease in international demand for steel and aluminum, or products manufactured therefrom and, produced in the United States, or otherwise negatively impact demand for our products, our business may be adversely impacted.We could incur substantial costs related to environmental, health, and safety laws. Our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental, health, and safety laws. These include laws that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and establish standards for the treatment, storage, and disposal of 15 regulated materials, and the investigation and remediation of contaminated soil, surface water, and groundwater. Failure to maintain or achieve compliance with these laws or with the permits required for our operations could result in substantial increases in operating costs and capital expenditures. In addition, we may be subject to fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third party claims for property damage or personal injury, worker’s compensation or personal injury claims, cleanup costs, or temporary or permanent discontinuance of operations. Certain of our facilities are located in industrial areas, have a history of heavy industrial use and have been in operation for many years and, over time, we and other predecessor operators of these facilities have generated, used, handled, and disposed of hazardous and other regulated wastes. Environmental liabilities could exist, including cleanup obligations at these facilities or at off-site locations where materials from our operations were disposed of, which could result in future expenditures that cannot be currently quantified and which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Such liabilities may be imposed without regard to fault or the legality of a party’s conduct and may, in certain circumstances, be joint and several. Future changes to environmental, health, and safety laws, including those related to climate change, could result in material liabilities and costs, constrain operations or make such operations more costly for us, our suppliers, and our customers. In October 2011, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) named us as one of more than 100 businesses that may be a potentially responsible party for the Portland Harbor Superfund Site (the “PHS Site”). On January 6, 2017, the EPA issued an initial Record of Decision (“ROD”) regarding the site. The ROD includes a combination of dredging, capping, and enhanced natural recovery that would take approximately thirteen years to construct plus additional time for monitored natural recovery, at an estimated present value cost of $1.05 billion. At a meeting on December 4, 2018, the EPA announced that it expects parties to submit a plan to remediate the river and harbor per the original ROD within the next 2-3 years. It also expects allocation of amounts among the parties to be determined in the same time frame. It is willing to consider de minimus and de micromis settlements but is unlikely to approve any before completion of the remedial design process.The EPA has not yet allocated responsibility for the contamination among the potentially responsible parties, including JT Ryerson. We do not currently have sufficient information available to us to determine whether the ROD will be executed as currently stated, whether and to what extent JT Ryerson may be held responsible for any of the identified contamination, and how much (if any) of the final plan’s costs might ultimately be allocated to JT Ryerson. Therefore, management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or estimate a range of potential loss at this time.Regulations related to conflict-free minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and place us at a competitive disadvantage. On August 22, 2012, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), the United States SEC adopted new requirements for reporting companies that use certain minerals and metals, known as “conflict minerals”, in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. These requirements require companies to diligence, disclose, and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to conclusively verify the origins for all metals used in our products and we may face reputational challenges with our customers. Additionally, as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering “conflict free” metals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary metals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Accordingly, we could incur significant cost related to the compliance process, including potential difficulty or added costs in satisfying the disclosure requirements. Moreover, we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.Tax changes could affect our effective tax rate, the value of our deferred tax assets, and future profitability.Our future results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate or changes in the treatment of deferred tax assets as a result of changes in Ryerson’s overall profitability, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax legislation, the results of the examination of previously filed tax returns, and continuing assessment of the Company’s tax exposures. In particular, although the passage of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 reduced the U.S. tax rate to 21%, our future earnings could be negatively impacted by changes in tax legislation including changing tax rates and tax base such as limiting, phasing-out, or eliminating deductions or tax credits, changing rules for earnings repatriations and changing other tax laws in the U.S. or other countries. In addition, it is uncertain if, and to what extent, various states will conform to the new tax law and foreign countries will react by adopting tax legislation or taking other actions that could adversely affect our business.We are subject to litigation that could strain our resources and distract management. From time to time, we are involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, and other disputes arising in the ordinary course of business. These suits concern issues including product liability, contract disputes, employee-related matters, and personal injury matters. It is not feasible to predict the outcome of all pending suits and claims, and the ultimate resolution of these matters as well as future lawsuits that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or reputation. 16 We may face product liability claims that are costly and create adverse publicity. If any of the products that we sell cause harm to any of our customers, we could be exposed to product liability lawsuits. If we were found liable under product liability claims, we could be required to pay substantial monetary damages. Further, even if we successfully defended ourselves against this type of claim, we could be forced to spend a substantial amount of money in litigation expenses, our management could be required to spend valuable time in the defense against these claims, and our reputation could suffer.  Our risk management strategies may result in losses. From time to time, we may use fixed-price and/or fixed-volume supplier contracts to offset contracts with customers. Additionally, we may use foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge Canadian dollar, Euro, and floating rate debt exposures. These risk management strategies pose certain risks, including the risk that losses on a hedge position may exceed the amount invested in such instruments. Moreover, a party in a hedging transaction may be unavailable or unwilling to settle our obligations, which could cause us to suffer corresponding losses. A hedging instrument may not be effective in eliminating all of the risks inherent in any particular position. Our profitability may be adversely affected during any period as a result of use of such instruments.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common StockThe market price for our common stock may be volatile.Historically, there has been volatility in the market price for our common stock. Furthermore, the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in the future in response to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the risk factors described herein. Examples include: •changes in commodity prices, especially metals; •announcement of our quarterly operating results or the operating results of other metals service centers;  •changes in financial estimates or recommendations by stock market analysts regarding us or our competitors; •the operating and stock performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable; •press releases, earnings releases, or publicity relating to us or our competitors or relating to trends in the metals service center industry; •inability to meet securities analysts’ and investors’ quarterly or annual estimates or targets of our performance; •sales of our common stock by large or controlling shareholders; •the amount of shares acquired for short-term investments; •general domestic or international economic, market, and political conditions; and •announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, dispositions or joint ventures, or other material events impacting the domestic or global metals industry.In the past, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their specific operating performance. These factors may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of actual operating performance.In addition, stock markets from time to time experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. In the past, some shareholders have brought securities class action lawsuits against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. We may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation, regardless of whether our defense is ultimately successful, could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources.17 We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations. We currently have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2018, our total indebtedness was approximately $1,153.3 million and we had approximately $392 million of unused capacity under the Ryerson Credit Facility. Our substantial indebtedness may:  •make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our outstanding notes and our other indebtedness;  •limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes;  •limit our ability to use our cash flow for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes;  •require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;  •limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;  •place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and  •increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of the Ryerson Credit Facility and the indenture governing our outstanding notes restrict but do not prohibit us from doing so, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify. The covenants in the Ryerson Credit Facility and the indenture governing our notes impose, and covenants contained in agreements governing indebtedness that we incur in the future may impose, restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility. The Ryerson Credit Facility and the indenture governing our outstanding notes contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries, including JT Ryerson, to:  •incur additional debt;  •pay dividends on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock;  •make certain investments or other restricted payments;  •create liens or use assets as security in other transactions;  •merge, consolidate, transfer, or dispose of substantially all of our assets; and  •engage in transactions with affiliates. The terms of the Ryerson Credit Facility require that, in the event availability under the facility declines to a certain level, we maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter. Total credit availability is limited by the amount of eligible accounts receivable, inventory, and qualified cash pledged as collateral under the agreement insofar as the Company is subject to a borrowing base comprised of the aggregate of these three amounts, less applicable reserves. As of December 31, 2018, total credit availability was $392 million. See discussion regarding the Ryerson Credit Facility in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”Additionally, subject to certain exceptions, the indenture governing the outstanding notes restricts JT Ryerson’s ability to pay Ryerson Holding dividends. Our future indebtedness may contain covenants more restrictive in certain respects than the restrictions contained in the Ryerson Credit Facility and the indenture governing the notes. Operating results below current levels or other adverse factors, including a significant increase in interest rates, could result in our being unable to comply with financial covenants that are contained in the Ryerson Credit Facility or that may be contained in any future indebtedness. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to holders of our notes and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions. 18 We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness. We are highly leveraged. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our outstanding notes, the Ryerson Credit Facility, and our other outstanding indebtedness are expected to account for significant cash interest expenses. Accordingly, we will have to generate significant cash flows from operations to meet our debt service requirements. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service and working capital requirements, we may be required to sell assets, seek additional capital, reduce capital expenditures, restructure or refinance all or a portion of our existing indebtedness, or seek additional financing. Moreover, insufficient cash flow may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. The right to receive payment on the 2022 Notes and the guarantees will be subordinated to the liabilities of non-guarantor subsidiaries.The notes and related guarantees are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness of our subsidiaries that are non-guarantors of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes (the “2022 Notes”). While the indenture governing the 2022 Notes limits the indebtedness and activities of these non-guarantor subsidiaries, holders of indebtedness of, and trade creditors of, non-guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under bank financing agreements, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before those assets are made available for distribution to any guarantor, as direct or indirect shareholder. While the non-guarantor subsidiaries have agreed under the indenture not to pledge or encumber their assets (other than with respect to permitted liens) without equally and ratably securing the notes, they will not guarantee the 2022 Notes notwithstanding any such pledge or encumbrance in favor of the 2022 Notes.The non-guarantor subsidiaries represented, respectively, 10.4% and 8.3% of our net sales and EBITDA for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, these non-guarantor subsidiaries represented respectively, 11.2% and 4.8% of our assets and liabilities, as of December 31, 2018.Accordingly, in the event that any of the non-guarantor subsidiaries or joint venture entities become insolvent, liquidates, or otherwise reorganizes: •the creditors of the guarantors (including the holders of the 2022 Notes) will have no right to proceed against such subsidiary’s assets; and  •the creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of assets of such subsidiary, as direct or indirect shareholder, and will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.Because a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain prevailing short-term interest rates, we are vulnerable to interest rate increases. A portion of our indebtedness, including the Ryerson Credit Facility, bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain short-term prevailing interest rates. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $535.9 million of outstanding borrowings under the Ryerson Credit Facility, with an additional $392 million available for borrowing under such facility. Assuming a consistent level of debt through-out 2018, a 100 basis point change in the interest rate on our floating rate debt effective from the beginning of the year would increase or decrease our interest expense under the Ryerson Credit Facility by approximately $4.0 million on an annual basis. If interest rates increase dramatically, we could be unable to service our debt, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Changes in our credit ratings and outlook may reduce access to capital and increase borrowing costs.Our credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and factors outside of our control, such as conditions affecting our industry generally or the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies. We cannot provide assurances that our current credit ratings will remain in effect or that the ratings will not be lowered, suspended, or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies. If rating agencies lower, suspend, or withdraw the ratings, the market price or marketability of our securities may be adversely affected. In addition, any negative change in ratings could make it more difficult for us to raise capital on acceptable terms, impact the ability to obtain adequate financing, and result in higher interest costs for our existing credit facilities, including the Ryerson Credit Facility, or on future financings.19 Platinum owns a significant percentage of our stock and has the right to nominate a majority of the members of the Corporation’s board and will be able to exert control over matters subject to stockholder approval.Platinum owns approximately 21,037,500 shares of our common stock, which is approximately 56% of our issued and outstanding common stock. Therefore, Platinum may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, Platinum may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that our stockholders may believe are in their best interest as stockholders.The Company is party to an investor rights agreement (the “Investor Rights Agreement”) with certain affiliates of Platinum which provides, among other things, that for so long as Platinum collectively beneficially owns (i) at least 30% of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the Company, Platinum will have the right to nominate for election to the board of directors of the Company no fewer than that number of directors that would constitute a majority of the number of directors if there were no vacancies on the board, (ii) at least 15% but less than 30% of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the Company, Platinum will have the right to nominate two directors and (iii) at least 5% but less than 15% of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the Company, Platinum will have the right to nominate one director. The agreement also provides that if the size of the board of directors is increased or decreased at any time, Platinum’s nomination rights will be proportionately increased or decreased, respectively, rounded up to the nearest whole number. As a result of Platinum’s ownership of a majority of the Company’s outstanding capital stock as well its board nomination rights pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, Platinum may significantly influence or effectively control our policies and operations, including the appointment of management, future issuances of our common stock or other securities, and the payment of dividends. In addition, Platinum has significant control over our decisions to enter into any other corporate transaction. The interests of Platinum may not in all cases be aligned with the interests of the other holders of our common stock. For example, a sale of a substantial number of shares of stock in the future by Platinum could cause our stock price to decline. Further, Platinum could cause us to make acquisitions that increase the amount of the indebtedness that is secured or senior to the Company’s existing debt or sell revenue-generating assets, impairing our ability to make payments under such debt. Additionally, Platinum is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Accordingly, Platinum may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, Platinum may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to holders of our common stock.We are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements because we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the NYSE rules and, as a result, our stockholders do not have the protections afforded by these corporate governance requirements.Because Platinum controls more than 50% of the voting power of our common stock, we are considered to be a “controlled company” for purposes of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) listing requirements. Under the NYSE rules, a “controlled company” may elect not to comply with certain NYSE corporate governance requirements, including (1) the requirement that a majority of our Board of Directors consist of independent directors, (2) the requirement that the nominating and corporate governance committee of our Board of Directors be composed entirely of independent directors, (3) the requirement that the compensation committee of our Board of Directors be composed entirely of independent directors, and (4) the requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nomination/corporate governance and compensation committees. Given that Platinum controls a majority of the voting power of our common stock, we are permitted, and have elected, to opt out of compliance with certain NYSE corporate governance requirements. Accordingly, holders of our common stock do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements.20 Our corporate documents and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of the Company.Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our Board of Directors. These provisions: •establish a classified Board of Directors so that not all members of our Board of Directors are elected at one time; •authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock; •provide that the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our amended and restated bylaws; •prohibit stockholders from acting by written consent if less than a majority of the voting power of our outstanding stock is controlled by Platinum; and •establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.Any issuance of preferred stock could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our common stock, which could depress the price of our common stock.Our Board of Directors will have the authority to issue preferred stock and to determine the preferences, limitations, and relative rights of shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Our preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend, and other rights superior to the rights of our common stock. The potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of us, discouraging bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price, and adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.We have not and do not intend to pay regular cash dividends on our stock.We do not anticipate declaring or paying regular cash dividends on our common stock or any other equity security in the foreseeable future. The amounts that may be available to us to pay cash dividends are restricted under our debt agreements. Any payment of cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, future prospects, contractual restrictions, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Therefore, you should not rely on dividend income from shares of our common stock. For more information, see “Dividend Policy.” Your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in us may be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and you sell your shares at a profit, but there is no guarantee that the market price for our common stock will ever exceed the price that you pay for our common stock"

Readers are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and may involve significant risks and uncertainties, and that actual results may vary materially from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. Among the factors that significantly impact the metals distribution industry and our business are:  •highly cyclical fluctuations resulting from, among others, seasonality, market uncertainty and costs of goods sold;  •remaining competitive and maintaining market share in the highly competitive and fragmented metals distribution industry;  •managing the costs of purchased metals relative to the price at which we sell our products during periods of rapid price escalation;  •our substantial indebtedness and the covenants in instruments governing such indebtedness; •the impairment of goodwill that could result from, among other things, volatility in the markets in which we operate; •the failure to effectively integrate newly acquired operations;  •the regulatory and other operational risks associated with our operations located outside of the United States (or “U.S.”); •the management of inventory and other costs and expenses; •the adequacy of our efforts to mitigate cyber security risks and threats; •reduced production schedules, layoffs or work stoppages by our own, our suppliers’ or customers’ personnel;  •certain employee retirement benefit plans are underfunded and the actual costs could exceed current estimates;  •future funding for postretirement employee benefits may require substantial payments from current cash flow;  •prolonged disruption of our processing centers;  •the ability to retain and attract management and key personnel;  •the ability of management to focus on North American and foreign operations;  •the ability to comply with the terms of our asset-based credit facility and our indenture; •the incurrence of substantial costs or liabilities to comply with, or as a result of violations of, environmental laws;  •the impact of new or pending litigation against us;  •the risk of product liability claims;  •our risk management strategies may result in losses;  •currency fluctuations in the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar and the Chinese renminbi;  •customer, supplier, and competitor consolidation, bankruptcy or insolvency; •the ownership of a majority of our equity securities by a single investor group.These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements should, therefore, be considered in light of various factors, including those set forth in this Annual Report under “Risk Factors
” and the caption “Industry and Operating Trends” included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Moreover, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they were made.

Ryerson Holding Corporation (“Ryerson Holding”), a Delaware corporation, is the parent company of Joseph T. Ryerson & Son, Inc. (“JT Ryerson”), a Delaware corporation. Affiliates of Platinum Equity, LLC (“Platinum”) own approximately 21,037,500 shares of our common stock, which is approximately 57% of our issued and outstanding common stock. We are a leading value-added processor and distributor of industrial metals with operations in the United States through JT Ryerson, in Canada through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Ryerson Canada, Inc., a Canadian corporation (“Ryerson Canada”), and in Mexico through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Ryerson Metals de Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V., a Mexican corporation (“Ryerson Mexico”). In addition to our North American operations, we conduct materials processing and distribution operations in China through an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Ryerson China Limited (“Ryerson China”). Unless the context indicates otherwise, Ryerson Holding, JT Ryerson, Ryerson Canada, Ryerson China, and Ryerson Mexico together with their subsidiaries, are collectively referred to herein as “Ryerson,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company.” Our Company We believe we are one of the largest value-add processors and distributors of industrial metals in North America measured in terms of sales. Our industry is highly fragmented with the largest companies accounting for only a small percentage of total market share. Our customer base ranges from local, independently owned fabricators and machine shops to large, international original equipment manufacturers. We carry a full line of over 65,000 products in stainless steel, aluminum, carbon steel, and alloy steels and a limited line of nickel and red metals in various shapes and forms. More than 75% of the products we sell are processed to meet customer requirements. Specifically, we provide a wide range of flat and long metals products, we offer numerous value-added processing and fabrication services such as bending, beveling, blanking, blasting, burning, cutting-to-length, drilling, embossing, flattening, forming, grinding, laser cutting, machining, notching, painting, perforating, punching, rolling, sawing, scribing, shearing, slitting, stamping, tapping, threading, welding, or other techniques to process materials to a specified thickness, length, width, shape, and surface quality pursuant to specific customer orders. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we purchased 2.0 million tons of materials from suppliers throughout the world. Our value proposition also includes providing a superior level of customer service and responsiveness, technical services, and inventory management solutions. Our range of products together with our breadth of services allows us to create long-term partnerships with our customers and enhances our profitability.We track the processing, if any, performed on sold material for over 95% of our total revenues. The activities we track broadly fall into four main processing categories: (1) sheet processing (excludes fabrication activities), (2) as-is long and plate, (3) cut long and plate, and (4) fabrication.  A key metric that we track is the percentage mix of revenue that comes from our fabrication capabilities. In 2010, the mix of revenue from fabrication activities was 6.7% of our sales, while in 2017, our mix of revenue from fabrication activities rose to 9.8% of our sales largely due to the strategic investments we have made in value-added processing capital expenditures.We operate over 90 facilities across North America and five facilities in China. Our service centers are strategically located near our customers, which allows us to quickly process and deliver our products and services, often within the next day of receiving an order. We own, lease, or contract a fleet of tractors and trailers, allowing us to efficiently meet our customers’ delivery demands. In addition, our scale enables us to maintain low operating costs. Our operating expenses as a percentage of sales for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were 14.0% and 15.3%, respectively. We serve approximately 40,000 customers across a wide range of manufacturing end markets. Our geographic network and broad range of products and services allow us to serve large, international manufacturing companies across multiple locations. We believe the diverse end markets we serve reduce the volatility of our business in the aggregate.Industry Overview Metals service centers serve as key intermediaries between metal producers and end users of metal products. Metal producers offer commodity products and typically sell metals in the form of standard-sized coils, sheets, plates, structurals, bars, and tubes. Producers, mostly steel and aluminum mills, prefer large order quantities, longer lead times, and limited inventory to maximize capacity utilization across their typically higher capital-intensive structure. End users of metal products seek to purchase metals with customized specifications, including value-added processing. End-users in highly diverse industries such as machinery, construction, and transportation often look for “one-stop” suppliers that can offer processing services along with lower order volumes, shorter lead times, and more reliable delivery. 4 As an intermediary, metals service centers aggregate end-users’ demand, purchase metal in bulk to take advantage of economies of scale, and then process and sell metal that meets specific customer requirements. The metals service center industry is comprised of many companies, the majority of which have limited product lines and inventories, with customers located in a specific geographic area. In general, competition is based on quality, service, price, and geographic proximity. The metals service center industry typically experiences cash flow trends that are counter-cyclical to the revenue and volume growth of the industry. Companies in the industry primarily have working capital assets. During an industry downturn, companies generally reduce working capital assets and generate cash as inventory and accounts receivable balances decline. As a result, operating cash flow and liquidity tend to increase during a downturn, which typically facilitates industry participants’ ability to cover fixed costs and repay outstanding debt. We compete with many other metals service centers and to a lesser extent with primary metal producers. Primary metal producers typically sell to larger customers that require regular shipments of higher volumes of steel than the traditional service center customer. Competitive Strengths Leading Market Position in North America. We believe we are one of the largest service center companies for carbon and stainless steel as well as aluminum based on sales in the North American market where we have a broad geographic presence with over 90 facilities. Our service centers are located near our customer locations, enabling us to provide timely delivery to customers across numerous geographic markets. Additionally, our widespread network of locations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico helps us to utilize our expertise to more efficiently serve customers with complex supply chain requirements across multiple manufacturing locations. We believe this is a key differentiator for customers who need a supplier that can reliably and consistently support them. Our ability to transfer inventory among our facilities better enables us to more timely and profitably source and process specialized items at regional locations throughout our network than if we were required to maintain inventory of all products and specialized equipment at each location. We believe with our significant footprint in the North American market, combined with our significant scale and operating leverage, a cyclical recovery of the service center industry supported by long-term growth trends in our end markets should allow us to experience higher growth rates relative to North American economic improvement. However, there can be no guarantee that we will experience such higher growth rates. Broad Geographic Reach Across Attractive End Markets. Our operations serve a diverse range of industries including commercial ground transportation manufacturing, metal fabrication and machine shops, industrial machinery and equipment manufacturing, consumer durable equipment, HVAC manufacturing, construction equipment manufacturing, food processing and agricultural equipment manufacturing, and oil and gas. We believe these industries will provide demand for our products and services as the North American manufacturing economy continues to grow. In addition, we expect to benefit from continued growth in international markets that will help spur demand at domestic manufacturing facilities that sell into the global market. We believe that our ability to quickly adjust our offering based on regional and industry specific trends creates stability while also providing the opportunity to access specific growth markets. Established Platform for Organic and Acquisition Growth. Although there can be no guarantee of growth, we believe a number of our strategies, such as investing in value-added processing capabilities, analytically targeting attractive customers and end markets with our supply chain optimization service model, expanding our large network of service centers both through capital expenditures and acquisitions, and pricing our products and services based on the value we deliver to our customers will provide us with growth opportunities. Given the highly fragmented nature of the service center industry, we believe there are numerous additional opportunities to acquire businesses and incorporate them into our existing infrastructure. Given our large scale and geographic reach, we believe we can add value to these businesses in a number of ways, including providing greater purchasing power, improving expense and working capital management, access to additional end markets, and broadening product mix. 5 Lean Operating Structure Providing Operating Leverage. From significant historical changes to our footprint and decentralized operational management through tactical productivity and spending improvements, Ryerson has demonstrated the ability to effectively manage expenses.  In an improving metals service center environment characterized by increases in demand and/or pricing, we believe that most additional expenses to service higher revenue and margins would come from variable expenses while further leveraging economies of scale on our existing fixed expenses. We effectively managed our costs in 2017 with increased volume and cost inflation, as expenses as a percentage of sales declined from 15.3% in 2016 to 14.0% in 2017.  We have also focused on process improvements in inventory management. Average inventory days excluding LIFO decreased from 76 days in 2016 to 71 days in 2017.  This reduction has decreased our exposure to metals price movements as well as increased capacity in our facilities to devote to higher margin products and capabilities. These organizational and operating changes have improved our operating structure, working capital management, and efficiency. As a result of our initiatives, we have increased our financial flexibility and believe we have a favorable cost structure compared to many of our peers. This achievement will provide significant operating leverage if revenue improves. Extensive Breadth of Products and Services for Diverse Customer Base. We believe our broad product mix and marketing approach provides customers with a “one-stop shop” solution few other service center companies are able to offer. We provide a broad range of processing and fabrication services to meet the needs of our approximately 40,000 customers and typically fulfill more than 1,000,000 orders per year. We also provide supply chain solutions, including just-in-time delivery and value-added processing to many original equipment manufacturing customers. For the year ended December 31, 2017, no single customer accounted for more than 2% of our sales, and our top 10 customers accounted for less than 12% of our sales. Strong Relationships with Suppliers. We are among the largest purchasers of metals in North America and have long-term relationships with many of our North American suppliers. We believe we are frequently one of the largest customers of our suppliers and that concentrating our orders among a core group of suppliers is effective for obtaining favorable pricing and service. We believe we have the opportunity to further leverage this strength through continued focus on price and volume using an analytics-driven approach to procurement. In addition, we view our strategic suppliers as supply chain partners. Our coordinated effort focused on logistics, lead times, rolling schedules, and scrap return programs ultimately results in value-based buying that is advantageous for us. Metals producers worldwide are consolidating, and large, geographically diversified customers, such as Ryerson, are desirable partners for these larger suppliers. Our relationships with suppliers often provide us with access to metals when supply is constrained. Through our knowledge of the global metals marketplace and capabilities of specific mills we believe we have developed a global purchasing strategy that allows us to secure favorable prices across our product lines. Experienced Management Team with Deep Industry Knowledge. Our senior management team has extensive industry and operational experience and has been instrumental in optimizing and implementing our strategy over the last five years. Our senior management has an average of more than 20 years of experience in the metals or service center industries. Our CEO, Mr. Edward Lehner, who joined the Company in August 2012 as CFO and became CEO in June 2015, has nearly 30 years of experience, predominantly in the metals industry. Mr. Erich Schnaufer, who joined the Company in 2005 and became CFO in January 2016, has over 25 years of financial and accounting experience and over 10 years with Ryerson. Under their leadership, we have increased our focus on positioning the Company for growth and enhanced profitability. Industry Outlook We believe that the United States economy has grown since the recession that began in 2008. According to the Institute for Supply Management, the Purchasing Managers’ Index (“PMI”) was above 50% for 30 of the last 36 months, which indicates that the U.S. manufacturing economy was generally expanding over the last three years. The PMI measures the economic health of the manufacturing sector and is a composite index based on five indicators: new orders, inventory levels, production, supplier deliveries, and the employment environment. PMI readings can be a good indicator of industrial activity and general economic growth. Manufacturing companies experienced a stronger demand environment in 2017 with industrial production, as measured by the U.S. 6 Federal Reserve, showing monthly year-over-year expansion in dollars spent from December 2016 through December 2017 after 20 straight months of decline prior to November 2016.Additionally, the overall U.S. economy is projected to continue growing as evidenced by the Federal Reserve’s midrange forecasted real GDP growth rates of 2.5%, 2.1%, and 2.0% for 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. Steel demand in North America is largely dependent on growth of the automotive, industrial equipment, consumer appliance, and construction end markets. One of our key end markets is the industrial equipment sector, and according to the latest Livingston Survey, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, U.S. industrial production expanded by 1.8% in 2017 and is expected to grow by 2.6% in 2018 and 2.1% in 2019. China continues to be a key driver in the growth of global metals demand. According to the International Monetary Fund, China’s GDP grew 6.5% in 2017 and is projected to grow 6.6% in 2018 and 6.3% in 2019.Products and Services We carry a full line of carbon steel, stainless steel, alloy steels, and aluminum, and a limited line of nickel and red metals. These materials are stocked in a number of shapes, including coils, sheets, rounds, hexagons, square and flat bars, plates, structurals, and tubing. The following table shows our percentage of sales by major product lines for 2017, 2016, and 2015:  Product Line 2017  2016  2015 Carbon Steel Flat  28%  28%  25%Carbon Steel Plate  10   9   11 Carbon Steel Long  12   13   16 Stainless Steel Flat  18   17   16 Stainless Steel Plate  4   4   4 Stainless Steel Long  4   3   3 Aluminum Flat  15   16   16 Aluminum Plate  3   3   3 Aluminum Long  4   5   4 Other  2   2   2 Total  100%  100%  100%More than 75% of the materials sold by us are processed. We use processing and fabricating techniques such as bending, beveling, blanking, blasting, burning, cutting-to-length, drilling, embossing, flattening, forming, grinding, laser cutting, machining, notching, painting, perforating, punching, rolling, sawing, scribing, shearing, slitting, stamping, tapping, threading, welding, or other techniques to process materials to specified thickness, length, width, shape, and surface quality pursuant to specific customer orders. Among the most common processing techniques used by us are slitting, which involves cutting coiled metals to specified widths along the length of the coil, and leveling, which involves flattening coiled metals and cutting them to exact lengths. We also use third-party fabricators to outsource certain processes that we are not able to perform internally (such as pickling and other coating processes or heat treating) to enhance our value-added services. The plate burning and fabrication processes are particularly important to us. These processes require sophisticated and expensive processing equipment. As a result, rather than making investments in such equipment, manufacturers have increasingly outsourced these processes to metals service centers. As part of securing customer orders, we also provide services to our customers to assure cost effective material application while maintaining or improving the customers’ product quality. Our services include: just-in-time inventory programs, production of configured kits containing multiple custom products for ease of assembly by the customer, consignment arrangements, and the placement of our employees at a customer’s site for inventory management and production and technical assistance. We also provide special stocking programs in which products that would not otherwise be stocked by us are held in inventory to meet certain customers’ needs. These services are designed to reduce customers’ costs by minimizing their investment in inventory and processing equipment and improving their production efficiency. 7 Additional financial information is presented in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference.Customers Our customer base is diverse, numbering approximately 40,000 and including most metal-consuming industries, most of which are cyclical. For the year ended December 31, 2017, no single customer accounted for more than 2 percent of our sales, and the top 10 customers accounted for less than 12 percent of our sales. Substantially all of our sales are attributable to our U.S. operations and substantially all of our long-lived assets are located in the United States. The following table shows the Company’s percentage of sales by metal consuming industry for 2017, 2016, and 2015:    Percentage of Sales Metal Consuming Industry 2017  2016  2015 Metal fabrication and machine shops  20%  18%  18%Industrial machinery and equipment  18   18   17 Commercial ground transportation  16   16   18 Consumer durable  11   11   10 Food processing and agricultural equipment  10   9   7 Construction equipment  9   9   8 HVAC  7   7   8 Oil & gas  5   5   7 Other  4   7   7 Total  100%  100%  100% Some of our largest customers have procurement programs with us, typically ranging from three months to one year in duration. Pricing for these contracts is generally based on a pricing formula rather than a fixed price for the program duration. However, certain customer contracts are at fixed prices; to minimize our financial exposure, we generally match these fixed-price sales programs with fixed-price supply programs. In general, sales to customers are priced at the time of sale based on prevailing market prices.Suppliers For the year ended December 31, 2017, our top 25 suppliers accounted for approximately 76% of our purchase dollars. We purchase the majority of our inventories at prevailing market prices from key suppliers with which we have established relationships to obtain improvements in price, quality, delivery, and service. We are generally able to meet our materials requirements because we use many suppliers, there is a substantial overlap of product offerings from these suppliers, and there are several other suppliers able to provide identical or similar products. Because of the competitive nature of the business, when metal prices increase due to product demand, mill surcharges, input costs, supplier consolidation, or other factors that in turn lead to supply constraints or longer mill lead times and higher procured material costs, we may not be able to fully pass our increased material costs to customers. In recent decades, there have been significant consolidations among suppliers of carbon steel, stainless steel, and aluminum. We believe we will be able to meet our material requirements and believe we will continue to be among the largest customers of our suppliers. Sales and Marketing We maintain our own professional sales force. In addition to our office sales staff, we market and sell our products through the use of our field sales force that we believe has extensive product and customer knowledge and offers a comprehensive catalog of our products. Our office and field sales staffs, which together consist of approximately 680 employees, include technical and metallurgical personnel. A portion of our customers experience seasonal slowdowns. Our sales, as measured in tonnage sold, in the months of July, November, and December traditionally have been lower than in other months because of a reduced number of shipping days and holiday or vacation closures for some customers. Consequently, our sales in the first two quarters of the year are usually higher than in the third and fourth quarters. Capital Expenditures In recent years we have made capital expenditures to maintain, improve, and expand processing capabilities. Investments by us in property, plant, and equipment, together with asset retirements for the five years ended December 31, 2017, excluding the initial 8 purchase price of acquisitions are set forth below. The net capital change during such period aggregated to an increase of $53.4 million.    Additions  Retirementsor Sales  Net   (In millions) 2017 $25.1  $24.9  $0.2 2016  23.0   5.0   18.0 2015  22.3   9.1   13.2 2014  21.6   6.3   15.3 2013  20.2   13.5   6.7  We currently anticipate capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, of up to approximately $25 million for 2018. We expect capital expenditures will be funded from cash generated by operations and available borrowings. Employees As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 3,300 persons in North America and 300 persons in China. Our North American workforce was comprised of approximately 1,500 office employees and approximately 1,800 plant employees. Twenty percent of our plant employees were members of various unions, including the United Steel Workers and The International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Six renewal contracts covering approximately 111 employees were successfully negotiated in 2017. Six contracts covering 95 employees are currently scheduled to expire in 2018.Environmental, Health and Safety Matters Our facilities and operations are subject to many foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and to health and safety. In particular, our operations are subject to extensive requirements relating to waste disposal, recycling, air and water emissions, the handling of regulated materials, remediation, underground storage tanks, asbestos-containing building materials, workplace exposure, and other matters. We believe that our operations are currently in substantial compliance with all such laws and do not presently anticipate substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future in order to meet environmental, workplace health or safety requirements, or to pay for any investigations, corrective action, or claims. Claims, enforcement actions, or investigations regarding personal injury, property damage, or violation of environmental laws could result in substantial costs to us, divert our management’s attention, and result in significant liabilities, fines, or the suspension or interruption of our facilities. We continue to analyze and implement safeguards to mitigate any environmental, health, and safety risks we may face. As a result, additional costs and liabilities may be incurred to comply with future requirements or to address newly discovered conditions, and these costs and liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. For example, there is increasing likelihood that additional regulation of greenhouse gas emissions will occur at the foreign, federal, state, and local level, which could affect us, our suppliers, and our customers. While the costs of compliance could be significant, given the uncertain outcome and timing of future action by the U.S. federal government and states on this issue, we cannot accurately predict the financial impact of future greenhouse gas regulations on our operations or our customers at this time. We do not currently anticipate any new programs disproportionately impacting us compared to our competitors. Some of the properties currently or previously owned or leased by us are located in industrial areas or have a long history of heavy industrial use. We may incur environmental liabilities with respect to these properties in the future including costs of investigations, corrective action, claims for natural resource damages, claims by third parties relating to property damages, or claims relating to contamination at sites where we have sent waste for treatment or disposal. Based on currently available information we do not expect any investigation, remediation matters, or claims related to properties presently or formerly owned, operated, or to which we have sent waste for treatment or disposal would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. In October 2011, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) named us as one of more than 100 businesses that may be a potentially responsible party for the Portland Harbor Superfund Site (the “PHS Site”). On January 6, 2017, the EPA issued an initial Record of Decision (“ROD”) regarding the site. The EPA has now requested a Pre-Remedial Design Report (“Pre-RD”) to help determine if the ROD is appropriate or should be reduced.  The Pre-RD is due on May 9, 2019, and a revised ROD should be issued sometime thereafter. The ROD includes a combination of dredging, capping, and enhanced natural recovery that 9 would take approximately thirteen years to construct plus additional time for monitored natural recovery, at an estimated present value cost of $1.05 billion. The EPA has not yet allocated responsibility for the contamination among the potentially responsible parties, including us. We do not currently have sufficient information available to us to determine whether the ROD will be executed as currently stated, whether and to what extent we may be held responsible for any of the identified contamination, and how much (if any) of the final plan’s costs might ultimately be allocated to us. Therefore, management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or estimate a range of potential loss at this time. Excluding any potential additional remediation costs resulting from any corrective action for the properties described above, we expect spending for pollution control projects to remain at historical levels below $500,000 per year. Our United States operations are also subject to the Department of Transportation Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations. We operate a private trucking motor fleet for making deliveries to some of our customers. Our drivers do not carry any material quantities of hazardous materials. Our foreign operations are subject to similar regulations. Future regulations could increase maintenance, replacement, and fuel costs for our fleet. These costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. Intellectual Property We own several U.S. and foreign trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Certain of the trademarks are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and, in certain circumstances, with the trademark offices of various foreign countries. We consider certain other information owned by us to be trade secrets. We protect our trade secrets by, among other things, entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees regarding such matters and implementing measures to restrict access to sensitive data and computer software source code on a need-to-know basis. We believe that these safeguards adequately protect our proprietary rights and we vigorously defend these rights. While we consider all our intellectual property rights as a whole to be important, we do not consider any single right to be essential to our operations as a whole.Foreign OperationsOur foreign operations as a percentage of total sales for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were as follows:    Year Ended December 31, Foreign Location 2017  2016  2015 Canada  7%  8%  8%China  4   5   4 Mexico < 1  < 1  < 1  Our foreign assets as a percentage of consolidated assets at December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were as follows:     At December 31, Foreign Location 2017  2016  2015 Canada  10%  10%  10%China  5   5   5 Mexico < 1  < 1  < 1 See Note 13 “Segment Information” of Part II, Item 8 ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" for further information on U.S. and foreign revenues and long-lived assets.Ryerson Canada Ryerson Canada, an indirect wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary of Ryerson Holding, is a metals service center.

You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the other information in this report, including the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors below will not occur. These risks could have a material and adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Risks Related to Our Business and IndustryWeakness in the economy, market trends, and other conditions affecting the profitability and financial stability of our customers could negatively impact our sales growth and results of operations. Economic and industry trends affect our business environments. We serve several industries in which the demand for our products and services is sensitive to the production activity, capital spending, and demand for products and services of our customers. Many of these customers operate in markets that are subject to highly cyclical fluctuations resulting from seasonality, market uncertainty, costs of goods sold, currency exchange rates, foreign competition, offshoring of production, oil and natural gas prices, geopolitical developments, and a variety of other factors beyond our control. Any of these factors could cause customers to idle or close facilities, delay purchases, reduce production levels, or experience reductions in the demand for their own products or services.Any of these events could impair the ability of our customers to make full and timely payments or reduce the volume of products and services these customers purchase from us and could cause increased pressure on our selling prices and terms of sale. We do not expect the cyclical nature of our industry to change and any downturn in our customers’ industries could reduce our revenues and profitability or a significant or prolonged slowdown in activity in the United States (U.S.), Canada, or any other major world economy, or a segment of any such economy, could negatively impact our sales growth and results of operations.The metals distribution business is very competitive and increased competition could reduce our revenues and gross margins.  The metals distribution industry is highly fragmented and competitive, consisting of a large number of small companies and a few relatively large companies. We face competition in all markets we serve. Competition is based principally on price, service, quality, production capabilities, inventory availability, and timely delivery. Competition in the various markets in which we participate comes from companies of various sizes, some of which have greater financial resources than we have and some of which have more established brand names in the local markets we serve. Increased competition could reduce our market share, force us to lower our prices, or to offer increased services at a higher cost, which could reduce our profitability. 11 Changing metals prices may have a significant impact on our liquidity, net sales, gross margins, operating income, and net income. The metals industry as a whole is cyclical and, at times, pricing and availability of metal can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control, including general domestic and international economic conditions, labor costs, sales levels, competition, levels of inventory held by other metals service centers, consolidation of metals producers, higher raw material costs for the producers of metals, import duties and tariffs, and currency exchange rates. This volatility can significantly affect the availability and cost of materials for us. Our ability to pass on increases in costs in a timely manner depends on market conditions and may result in lower gross margins. We maintain substantial inventories of metal to accommodate the short lead times and just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers. Accordingly, we purchase metals in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon historic buying practices, contracts with customers, and market conditions. When metals prices decline, customer demands for lower prices and our competitors’ responses to those demands result in lower sale prices and, consequently, lower margins as we use existing metals inventory. Declines in prices or further reductions in sales volumes could adversely impact our ability to maintain our liquidity and to remain in compliance with certain financial covenants under our $750 million revolving credit facility (the “Ryerson Credit Facility”), as well as result in us incurring inventory or goodwill impairment charges. Changing metals prices therefore could significantly impact our liquidity, net sales, gross margins, operating income, and net income. Changes in inflation may adversely affect gross margins. Inflation impacts the costs at which we can procure product and the ability to increase prices to customers over time. Prolonged periods of deflation could adversely affect the degree to which we are able to increase sales through price increases.Unexpected product shortages could negatively impact customer relationships, resulting in an adverse impact on results of operations. Disruptions could occur due to factors beyond our control, including economic downturns, political unrest, port slowdowns, trade issues, including increased export or import duties or trade restrictions, and other factors, any of which could adversely affect a supplier’s ability to manufacture or deliver products. For our sources of lower cost products from Asia and other areas of the world, the risk for disruptions has increased due to the additional lead time required and distances involved, and the current political climate seeking trade reform. If we were to experience difficulty in obtaining products, there could be a short-term adverse effect on results of operations and a longer-term adverse effect on customer relationships and our reputation. In addition, we have strategic relationships with a number of vendors. In the event we are unable to maintain those relations, there might be a loss of competitive pricing advantages which could, in turn, adversely affect results of operations.Changes in customer or product mix could cause the gross margin percentage to decline. From time to time, we experience changes in customer and product mix that affect gross margin. Changes in customer and product mix result primarily from business acquisitions, changes in customer demand, customer acquisitions, selling and marketing activities, and competition. If rapid growth with lower margin customers occurs, we will face pressure to maintain current gross margins, as these customers receive more discounted pricing due to their higher sales volume. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain historical gross margins in the future.The volatility of the market could result in a material impairment of goodwill. We evaluate goodwill annually on October 1 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment. Events or changes in circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to our historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner or the use of our assets or the strategy for our overall business, and significant negative industry or economic trends. We test for impairment of goodwill by assessing various qualitative factors with respect to development in our business and the overall economy and calculating the fair value of a reporting unit using a combination of an income approach based on discounted future cash flows and a market approach at the date of valuation. Under the discounted cash flow method, the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated based on expected future economic benefits discounted to a present value at a rate of return commensurate with the risk associated with the investment. Projected cash flows are discounted to present value using an estimated weighted average cost of capital, which considers both returns to equity and debt investors.12 We may not be able to successfully consummate and complete the integration of future acquisitions, and if we are unable to do so, it could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs and/or decreases in revenues and result of operations. We have grown through a combination of internal expansion, acquisitions, and joint ventures. We intend to continue to grow through selective acquisitions, but we may not be able to identify appropriate acquisition candidates, obtain financing on satisfactory terms, consummate acquisitions, or integrate acquired businesses effectively and profitably into our existing operations. Restrictions contained in the agreements governing our notes, the Ryerson Credit Facility, or our other existing or future debt may also inhibit our ability to make certain investments, including acquisitions, and participations in joint ventures. Acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures, and other business combination transactions, both foreign and domestic, involve various inherent risks, such as uncertainties in assessing value, strengths, weaknesses, liabilities, and potential profitability. There is also risk relating to our ability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from the transactions. Additionally, problems could arise from the integration of acquired businesses, including unanticipated changes in the business or industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition. Our future success will depend on our ability to complete the integration of these future acquisitions successfully into our operations. Specifically, after any acquisition, customers may choose to diversify their supply chains to reduce reliance on a single supplier for a portion of their metals needs. We may not be able to retain all of our and an acquisition’s customers, which may adversely affect our business and sales. Integrating acquisitions, particularly large acquisitions, requires us to enhance our operational and financial systems and employ additional qualified personnel, management, and financial resources, and may adversely affect our business by diverting management away from day-to-day operations. Further, failure to successfully integrate acquisitions may adversely affect our profitability by creating significant operating inefficiencies that could increase our operating expenses as a percentage of sales and reduce our operating income. In addition, we may not realize expected cost savings from acquisitions. Any one or more of these factors could cause us to not realize the benefits anticipated or have a negative impact on the fair value of the reporting units. Accordingly, goodwill and intangible assets recorded as a result of acquisitions could become impaired.We may not be able to retain or expand our customer base if the North American manufacturing industry continues to erode through moving offshore or through acquisition and merger or consolidation activity in our customers’ industries. Our customer base primarily includes manufacturing and industrial firms. Some of our customers operate in industries that are undergoing consolidation through acquisition and merger activity; some are considering or have considered relocating production operations overseas or outsourcing particular functions overseas; and some customers have closed as they were unable to compete successfully with overseas competitors. Our facilities are predominately located in the United States and Canada. To the extent that our customers cease U.S. operations, relocate or move operations overseas to regions in which we do not have a presence, we could lose their business. Acquirers of manufacturing and industrial firms may have suppliers of choice that do not include us, which could impact our customer base and market share. Certain of our operations are located outside of the United States, which subjects us to risks associated with international activities. Certain of our operations are located outside of the United States, primarily in Canada, China, and Mexico. We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making corrupt payments or otherwise corruptly giving any thing of value to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment, and requires companies to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices. The FCPA applies to covered companies, individual directors, officers, employees, and agents. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for some actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives. If we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA, governmental authorities in the United States could seek to impose civil and/or criminal penalties. We may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations in the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar and the Chinese renminbi. We have significant operations in Canada which incur the majority of their metal supply costs in U.S. dollars but earn the majority of their sales in Canadian dollars. Additionally, we have significant assets in China. We may from time to time experience losses when the value of the U.S. dollar strengthens against the Canadian dollar or the Chinese renminbi, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, we are subject to translation risk when we consolidate our Canadian and Chinese subsidiaries’ net assets into our balance sheet. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar or Chinese renminbi could reduce the value of these assets as reported in our financial statements, which could, as a result, reduce our stockholders’ equity.13 The Chinese government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities, particularly with regards to the land our facilities are located on. The Chinese government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property, and other matters. We believe that our operations in China are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations. Moreover, the Chinese court system does not provide the same property and contract right guarantees as do courts in the United States and, accordingly, disputes may be protracted and resolution of claims may result in significant economic loss. Additionally, there is no private ownership of land in China and all land ownership is held by the government of China, its agencies, and collectives, which issue land use rights that are generally renewable. We lease the land where our Chinese facilities are located from the Chinese government. If the Chinese government decided to terminate our land use rights agreements, our assets could become impaired and our ability to meet customer orders could be impacted. Damage to our information technology infrastructure could harm our business. The unavailability of any of our computer-based systems for any significant period of time could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In particular, our ability to manage inventory levels successfully largely depends on the efficient operation of our computer hardware and software systems. We use management information systems to track inventory information at individual facilities, communicate customer information, and aggregate daily sales, margin, and promotional information. Difficulties associated with upgrades, installations of major software or hardware, and integration with new systems could have a material adverse effect on results of operations. We could be required to expend substantial resources to integrate our information systems with the systems of companies we have acquired. The integration of these systems may disrupt our business or lead to operating inefficiencies. In addition, these systems are vulnerable to, among other things, damage or interruption from fire, flood, tornado, and other natural disasters, power loss, computer system and network failures, operator negligence, physical and electronic loss of data, or security breaches and computer viruses. We are subject to cybersecurity risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks.We depend on the proper functioning and availability of our information technology platform, including communications and data processing systems, in operating our business. These systems include software programs that are integral to the efficient operation of our business. We have established security measures, controls, and procedures, including established recovery procedures for critical systems and business functions, to safeguard our information technology systems and to prevent unauthorized access to such systems and any data processed or stored in such systems, and we periodically evaluate and test the adequacy of such systems, measures, controls, and procedures; however, there can be no guarantee that such systems, measures, controls, and procedures will be effective. Security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of our information, litigation, and potential liability. In addition, cyber incidents that impact the availability, reliability, speed, accuracy, or other proper functioning of these systems could have a significant impact on our operations, and potentially on our results.  We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyberattacks. A significant cyber incident, including system failure, security breach, disruption by malware, or other damage could interrupt or delay our operations, result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, damage our reputation, cause a loss of customers, or give rise to monetary fines and other penalties, which could be significant.Any significant work stoppages can harm our business. As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 3,300 persons in North America and 300 persons in China. Our North American workforce was comprised of approximately 1,500 office employees and approximately 1,800 plant employees. Twenty percent of our plant employees were members of various unions, including the United Steel Workers and The International Brotherhood of Teamsters.Six renewal contracts covering approximately 111 employees were successfully negotiated in 2017. Six contracts covering 95 employees are currently scheduled to expire in 2018.Certain employee retirement benefit plans are underfunded and the actual cost of those benefits could exceed current estimates, which would require us to fund the shortfall. As of December 31, 2017, our pension plan had an unfunded liability of $165 million. Our actual costs for benefits required to be paid may exceed those projected and future actuarial assessments to the extent that those costs exceed the current assessment. 14 Under those circumstances, the adjustments required to be made to our recorded liability for these benefits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and cash payments to fund these plans could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows. We may be required to make substantial future contributions to improve the plan’s funded status. Future funding for postretirement employee benefits other than pensions also may require substantial payments from current cash flow. We provide postretirement life insurance and medical benefits to eligible retired employees. Our unfunded postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2017 was $69 million. Our actual costs for benefits required to be paid may exceed those projected and future actuarial assessments to the extent that those costs exceed the current assessment. Under those circumstances, adjustments will be required to be made to our recorded liability for these benefits. Any prolonged disruption of our processing centers could harm our business. We have dedicated processing centers that permit us to produce standardized products in large volumes while maintaining low operating costs. We may suffer prolonged disruption in the operations of any of these facilities, whether due to labor or technical difficulties, destruction, or damage to any of the facilities or otherwise. If we are unable to retain, attract, and motivate management and key personnel, it may adversely affect our business. In order to compete and have continued growth, we must attract, retain, and motivate executives and other key employees, including those in managerial, technical, sales, marketing, and support positions. We believe that our success is due, in part, to our experienced management team. Losing the services of one or more members of our management team such as our CEO, Edward J. Lehner, and CFO, Erich S. Schnaufer, could adversely affect our business and possibly prevent us from improving our operational, financial, and information management systems and controls. We compete to hire employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies. In the future, we may need to retain and hire additional qualified sales, marketing, administrative, operating, and technical personnel, and to train and manage new personnel. Our ability to implement our business plan is dependent on our ability to retain, hire and train a large number of qualified employees each year. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover, or increased employee benefit costs.Our international operations and potential joint ventures may cause us to incur costs and risks that may distract management from effectively operating our North American business, and such operations or joint ventures may not be profitable. We maintain foreign operations in Canada, China, and Mexico. International operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business in, and with, foreign countries, including price controls, exchange controls, export controls, economic sanctions, duties, tariffs, limitations on participation in local enterprises, nationalization, expropriation and other governmental action, and changes in currency exchange rates. While we believe that our current arrangements with local partners provide us with experienced business partners in foreign countries, events or issues, including disagreements with our partners, may occur that require attention of our senior executives and may result in expenses or losses that erode the profitability of our foreign operations or cause our capital investments abroad to be unprofitable. Lead time and the cost of our products could increase if we were to lose one of our primary suppliers. If, for any reason, our primary suppliers of aluminum, carbon steel, stainless steel, or other metals should curtail or discontinue their delivery of such metals in the quantities needed and at prices that are competitive, our business could suffer. The number of available suppliers could be reduced by factors such as industry consolidation and bankruptcies affecting steel and metal producers. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our top 25 suppliers represented approximately 76% of our purchases. We could be significantly and adversely affected if delivery were disrupted from a major supplier. If, in the future, we were unable to obtain sufficient amounts of the necessary metals at competitive prices and on a timely basis from our traditional suppliers, we may not be able to obtain such metals from alternative sources at competitive prices to meet our delivery schedules, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. Global metal overcapacity and imports of metal products into the United States have adversely affected, and may again adversely affect, United States metal prices, which could impact our sales and results of operations.Global metal production capacity currently exceeds global consumption of metal products. Such excess capacity sometimes results in metal manufacturers in certain countries exporting steel at prices that are lower than prevailing domestic prices and 15 sometimes at or below their cost of production. Excessive imports of metal into the United States, such as in recent years, have exerted and may continue to exert, downward pressure on United States steel prices which negatively affects our ability to increase our sales and results of operations.We could incur substantial costs related to environmental, health, and safety laws. Our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental, health, and safety laws. These include laws that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and establish standards for the treatment, storage, and disposal of regulated materials, and the investigation and remediation of contaminated soil, surface water, and groundwater. Failure to maintain or achieve compliance with these laws or with the permits required for our operations could result in substantial increases in operating costs and capital expenditures. In addition, we may be subject to fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third party claims for property damage or personal injury, worker’s compensation or personal injury claims, cleanup costs, or temporary or permanent discontinuance of operations. Certain of our facilities are located in industrial areas, have a history of heavy industrial use and have been in operation for many years and, over time, we and other predecessor operators of these facilities have generated, used, handled, and disposed of hazardous and other regulated wastes. Environmental liabilities could exist, including cleanup obligations at these facilities or at off-site locations where materials from our operations were disposed of, which could result in future expenditures that cannot be currently quantified and which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Such liabilities may be imposed without regard to fault or the legality of a party’s conduct and may, in certain circumstances, be joint and several. Future changes to environmental, health, and safety laws, including those related to climate change, could result in material liabilities and costs, constrain operations or make such operations more costly for us, our suppliers, and our customers. In October 2011, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) named us as one of more than 100 businesses that may be a potentially responsible party for the Portland Harbor Superfund Site (the “PHS Site”), which includes in-river and upland portions. On January 6, 2017, the EPA issued an initial Record of Decision (“ROD”) regarding the site. The EPA has now requested a Pre-Remedial Design Report (“Pre-RD”) to help determine if the ROD is appropriate or should be reduced.  The Pre-RD is due on May 9, 2019, and a revised ROD should be issued sometime thereafter. The ROD has an estimated present value cost of approximately $1.05 billion in total and would take approximately 13 years to complete. The allocation of responsibility for the contamination among the potentially responsible parties, including JT Ryerson, has not yet been determined. We do not currently have sufficient information available to us to determine whether the ROD will be executed as currently stated, whether and to what extent JT Ryerson may be held responsible for any of the identified contamination, and how much (if any) of the final plan’s costs might ultimately be allocated to JT Ryerson, the total cost of any required investigation or remediation of the PHS Site and therefore, management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or estimate a range of potential loss at this time. Regulations related to conflict-free minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and place us at a competitive disadvantage. On August 22, 2012, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), the United States SEC adopted new requirements for reporting companies that use certain minerals and metals, known as “conflict minerals”, in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. These requirements require companies to diligence, disclose, and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to conclusively verify the origins for all metals used in our products and we may face reputational challenges with our customers. Additionally, as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering “conflict free” metals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary metals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Accordingly, we could incur significant cost related to the compliance process, including potential difficulty or added costs in satisfying the disclosure requirements. Moreover, we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.Tax changes could affect our effective tax rate, the value of our deferred tax assets, and future profitability.Our future results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate or changes in the treatment of deferred tax assets as a result of changes in Ryerson’s overall profitability and changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax legislation, the results of the examination of previously filed tax returns, and continuing assessment of the Company’s tax exposures.We are subject to litigation that could strain our resources and distract management. From time to time, we are involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, and other disputes arising in the ordinary course of business. These suits concern issues including product liability, contract disputes, employee-related matters, and personal injury matters. It is 16 not feasible to predict the outcome of all pending suits and claims, and the ultimate resolution of these matters as well as future lawsuits that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or reputation. We may face product liability claims that are costly and create adverse publicity. If any of the products that we sell cause harm to any of our customers, we could be exposed to product liability lawsuits. If we were found liable under product liability claims, we could be required to pay substantial monetary damages. Further, even if we successfully defended ourselves against this type of claim, we could be forced to spend a substantial amount of money in litigation expenses, our management could be required to spend valuable time in the defense against these claims, and our reputation could suffer.  Our risk management strategies may result in losses. From time to time, we may use fixed-price and/or fixed-volume supplier contracts to offset contracts with customers. Additionally, we may use foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge Canadian dollar, Euro, and floating rate debt exposures. These risk management strategies pose certain risks, including the risk that losses on a hedge position may exceed the amount invested in such instruments. Moreover, a party in a hedging transaction may be unavailable or unwilling to settle our obligations, which could cause us to suffer corresponding losses. A hedging instrument may not be effective in eliminating all of the risks inherent in any particular position. Our profitability may be adversely affected during any period as a result of use of such instruments.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common StockThe market price for our common stock may be volatile.Historically, there has been volatility in the market price for our common stock. Furthermore, the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in the future in response to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the risk factors described herein. Examples include: •changes in commodity prices, especially metals; •announcement of our quarterly operating results or the operating results of other metals service centers;  •changes in financial estimates or recommendations by stock market analysts regarding us or our competitors; •the operating and stock performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable; •press releases, earnings releases, or publicity relating to us or our competitors or relating to trends in the metals service center industry; •inability to meet securities analysts’ and investors’ quarterly or annual estimates or targets of our performance; •sales of our common stock by large or controlling shareholders; •the amount of shares acquired for short-term investments; •general domestic or international economic, market, and political conditions; and •announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, dispositions or joint ventures, or other material events impacting the domestic or global metals industry.In the past, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their specific operating performance. These factors may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of actual operating performance.In addition, stock markets from time to time experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. In the past, some shareholders have brought securities class action lawsuits against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. We may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation, regardless of whether our defense is ultimately successful, could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources.17 We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations. We currently have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2017, our total indebtedness was approximately $1,045.7 million and we had approximately $264 million of unused capacity under the Ryerson Credit Facility. Our substantial indebtedness may:  •make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our outstanding notes and our other indebtedness;  •limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes;  •limit our ability to use our cash flow for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes;  •require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;  •limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;  •place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and  •increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of the Ryerson Credit Facility and the indenture governing our outstanding notes restrict but do not prohibit us from doing so, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify. The covenants in the Ryerson Credit Facility and the indenture governing our notes impose, and covenants contained in agreements governing indebtedness that we incur in the future may impose, restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility. The Ryerson Credit Facility and the indenture governing our outstanding notes contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries, including JT Ryerson, to:  •incur additional debt;  •pay dividends on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock;  •make certain investments or other restricted payments;  •create liens or use assets as security in other transactions;  •merge, consolidate, transfer, or dispose of substantially all of our assets; and  •engage in transactions with affiliates. The terms of the Ryerson Credit Facility require that, in the event availability under the facility declines to a certain level, we maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter. Total credit availability is limited by the amount of eligible accounts receivable, inventory, and qualified cash pledged as collateral under the agreement insofar as the Company is subject to a borrowing base comprised of the aggregate of these three amounts, less applicable reserves. As of December 31, 2017, total credit availability was $264 million.Additionally, subject to certain exceptions, the indenture governing the outstanding notes restricts JT Ryerson’s ability to pay Ryerson Holding dividends. Our future indebtedness may contain covenants more restrictive in certain respects than the restrictions contained in the Ryerson Credit Facility and the indenture governing the notes. Operating results below current levels or other adverse factors, including a significant increase in interest rates, could result in our being unable to comply with financial covenants that are contained in the Ryerson Credit Facility or that may be contained in any future indebtedness. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to holders of our notes and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions. 18 We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness. We are highly leveraged. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our outstanding notes, the Ryerson Credit Facility, and our other outstanding indebtedness are expected to account for significant cash interest expenses. Accordingly, we will have to generate significant cash flows from operations to meet our debt service requirements. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service and working capital requirements, we may be required to sell assets, seek additional capital, reduce capital expenditures, restructure or refinance all or a portion of our existing indebtedness, or seek additional financing. Moreover, insufficient cash flow may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. The right to receive payment on the 2022 Notes and the guarantees will be subordinated to the liabilities of non-guarantor subsidiaries.The notes and related guarantees are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness of our subsidiaries that are non-guarantors of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes (the “2022 Notes”). While the indenture governing the 2022 Notes limits the indebtedness and activities of these non-guarantor subsidiaries, holders of indebtedness of, and trade creditors of, non-guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under bank financing agreements, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before those assets are made available for distribution to any guarantor, as direct or indirect shareholder. While the non-guarantor subsidiaries have agreed under the indenture not to pledge or encumber their assets (other than with respect to permitted liens) without equally and ratably securing the notes, they will not guarantee the 2022 Notes notwithstanding any such pledge or encumbrance in favor of the 2022 Notes.The non-guarantor subsidiaries represented, respectively, 12.0% and 6.2% of our net sales and EBITDA for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, these non-guarantor subsidiaries represented respectively, 15.4% and 14.2% of our assets and liabilities, as of December 31, 2017.Accordingly, in the event that any of the non-guarantor subsidiaries or joint venture entities become insolvent, liquidates, or otherwise reorganizes: •the creditors of the guarantors (including the holders of the 2022 Notes) will have no right to proceed against such subsidiary’s assets; and  •the creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of assets of such subsidiary, as direct or indirect shareholder, and will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.Because a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain prevailing short-term interest rates, we are vulnerable to interest rate increases. A portion of our indebtedness, including the Ryerson Credit Facility, bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain short-term prevailing interest rates. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $384.2 million of outstanding borrowings under the Ryerson Credit Facility, with an additional $264 million available for borrowing under such facility. Assuming a consistent level of debt, a 100 basis point change in the interest rate on our floating rate debt effective from the beginning of the year would increase or decrease our interest expense under the Ryerson Credit Facility by approximately $2.7 million on an annual basis. If interest rates increase dramatically, we could be unable to service our debt, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Changes in our credit ratings and outlook may reduce access to capital and increase borrowing costs.Our credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and factors outside of our control, such as conditions affecting our industry generally or the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies. We cannot provide assurances that our current credit ratings will remain in effect or that the ratings will not be lowered, suspended, or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies. If rating agencies lower, suspend, or withdraw the ratings, the market price or marketability of our securities may be adversely affected. In addition, any change in ratings could make it more difficult for us to raise capital on acceptable terms, impact the ability to obtain adequate financing, and result in higher interest costs for our existing credit facilities, including the Ryerson Credit Facility, or on future financings.19 Platinum owns a significant percentage of our stock and has the right to nominate a majority of the members of the Corporation’s board and will be able to exert control over matters subject to stockholder approval.Platinum owns approximately 21,037,500 shares of our common stock, which is approximately 57% of our issued and outstanding common stock. Therefore, Platinum may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, Platinum may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that our stockholders may believe are in their best interest as stockholders.The Company is party to an investor rights agreement (the “Investor Rights Agreement”) with certain affiliates of Platinum which provides, among other things, that for so long as Platinum collectively beneficially owns (i) at least 30% of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the Company, Platinum will have the right to nominate for election to the board of directors of the Company no fewer than that number of directors that would constitute a majority of the number of directors if there were no vacancies on the board, (ii) at least 15% but less than 30% of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the Company, Platinum will have the right to nominate two directors and (iii) at least 5% but less than 15% of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the Company, Platinum will have the right to nominate one director. The agreement also provides that if the size of the board of directors is increased or decreased at any time, Platinum’s nomination rights will be proportionately increased or decreased, respectively, rounded up to the nearest whole number. As a result of Platinum’s ownership of a majority of the Company’s outstanding capital stock as well its board nomination rights pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, Platinum may significantly influence or effectively control our policies and operations, including the appointment of management, future issuances of our common stock or other securities, and the payment of dividends. In addition, Platinum has significant control over our decisions to enter into any other corporate transaction. The interests of Platinum may not in all cases be aligned with the interests of the other holders of our common stock. For example, a sale of a substantial number of shares of stock in the future by Platinum could cause our stock price to decline. Further, Platinum could cause us to make acquisitions that increase the amount of the indebtedness that is secured or senior to the Company’s existing debt or sell revenue-generating assets, impairing our ability to make payments under such debt. Additionally, Platinum is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Accordingly, Platinum may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, Platinum may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to holders of our common stock.We are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements because we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the NYSE rules and, as a result, our stockholders do not have the protections afforded by these corporate governance requirements.Because Platinum controls more than 50% of the voting power of our common stock, we are considered to be a “controlled company” for purposes of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) listing requirements. Under the NYSE rules, a “controlled company” may elect not to comply with certain NYSE corporate governance requirements, including (1) the requirement that a majority of our Board of Directors consist of independent directors, (2) the requirement that the nominating and corporate governance committee of our Board of Directors be composed entirely of independent directors, (3) the requirement that the compensation committee of our Board of Directors be composed entirely of independent directors, and (4) the requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nomination/corporate governance and compensation committees. Given that Platinum controls a majority of the voting power of our common stock, we are permitted, and have elected, to opt out of compliance with certain NYSE corporate governance requirements. Accordingly, holders of our common stock do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements.Our corporate documents and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of the Company.Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our Board of Directors. These provisions: •establish a classified Board of Directors so that not all members of our Board of Directors are elected at one time; •authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock; •provide that the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our amended and restated bylaws; •prohibit stockholders from acting by written consent if less than a majority of the voting power of our outstanding stock is controlled by Platinum; and20  •establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.Any issuance of preferred stock could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our common stock, which could depress the price of our common stock.Our Board of Directors will have the authority to issue preferred stock and to determine the preferences, limitations, and relative rights of shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Our preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend, and other rights superior to the rights of our common stock.

Ryerson Holding Corporation (“Ryerson Holding”), a Delaware corporation, is the parent company of Joseph T. Ryerson & Son, Inc. (“JT Ryerson”), a Delaware corporation. On December 17, 2014, Ryerson Inc., formerly a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Ryerson Holding, merged with and into JT Ryerson, which was previously an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Ryerson Holding, with JT Ryerson as the surviving corporation. As a result of such merger, from and after December 17, 2014, JT Ryerson has been a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Ryerson Holding. Affiliates of Platinum Equity, LLC (“Platinum”) own approximately 21,037,500 shares of our common stock, which is approximately 57% of our issued and outstanding common stock. We are a metals service center, with operations in the United States through JT Ryerson, in Canada through its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Ryerson Canada, Inc., a Canadian corporation (“Ryerson Canada”) and in Mexico through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Ryerson Metals de Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V., a Mexican corporation (“Ryerson Mexico”). In addition to our North American operations, we conduct materials distribution operations in China through an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Ryerson China Limited (“Ryerson China”). Unless the context indicates otherwise, Ryerson Holding, JT Ryerson, Ryerson Canada, Ryerson China, and Ryerson Mexico together with their subsidiaries, are collectively referred to herein as “Ryerson,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company.” Our Company We believe we are one of the largest value-add processors and distributors of industrial metals in North America measured in terms of sales. Our industry is highly fragmented with the largest companies accounting for only a small percentage of total market share. Our customer base ranges from local, independently owned fabricators and machine shops to large, international original equipment manufacturers. We carry a full line of over 65,000 products in stainless steel, aluminum, carbon steel and alloy steels and a limited line of nickel and red metals in various shapes and forms. More than 75% of the products we sell are processed to meet customer requirements. Specifically, we provide a wide range of flat and long metals products, we offer numerous value-added processing and fabrication services such as sawing, slitting, blanking, cutting to length, leveling, flame cutting, laser cutting, edge trimming, edge rolling, roll forming, tube manufacturing, polishing, shearing, forming, stamping, punching, rolling shell plate to radius and beveling to process materials to a specified thickness, length, width, shape and surface quality pursuant to specific customer orders. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we purchased 1.9 million tons of materials from suppliers throughout the world. Our value proposition also includes providing a superior level of customer service and responsiveness, technical services and inventory management solutions. Our range of products together with our breadth of services allows us to create long-term partnerships with our customers and enhances our profitability.We track the processing operations, if any, performed on sold material for over 95% of our total revenues. The activities we track broadly fall into four main processing categories: (1) sheet processing (excludes fabrication activities), (2) as-is long and plate, (3) cut long and plate, and (4) fabrication.  A key metric that we track is the percentage mix of revenue that comes from our fabrication capabilities. In 2010, the mix of revenue from fabrication activities was 6.7% of our sales, while in 2016, our mix of revenue from fabrication activities rose to 9.2% of our sales largely due to the strategic investments we have made in value-added processing capital expenditures.We operate over 90 facilities across North America and five facilities in China. Our service centers are strategically located in close proximity to our customers, which allows us to quickly process and deliver our products and services, often within the next day of receiving an order. We own, lease or contract a fleet of tractors and trailers, allowing us to efficiently meet our customers’ delivery demands. In addition, our scale enables us to maintain low operating costs. Our operating expenses as a percentage of sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were 15.3% and 14.5%, respectively. We serve approximately 40,000 customers across a wide range of manufacturing end markets. Our geographic network and broad range of products and services allow us to serve large, international manufacturing companies across multiple locations. We believe the diverse end markets we serve reduce the volatility of our business in the aggregate.Industry Overview Metals service centers serve as key intermediaries between metal producers and end users of metal products. Metal producers offer commodity products and typically sell metals in the form of standard-sized coils, sheets, plates, structurals, bars and tubes. Producers, mostly steel and aluminum mills, prefer large order quantities, longer lead times and limited inventory in order to maximize capacity utilization across their typically higher capital-intensive structure. 4 End users of metal products seek to purchase metals with customized specifications, including value-added processing. End-users in highly diverse industries such as machinery, construction and transportation often look for “one-stop” suppliers that can offer processing services along with lower order volumes, shorter lead times, and more reliable delivery. As an intermediary, metals service centers aggregate end-users’ demand, purchase metal in bulk to take advantage of economies of scale and then process and sell metal that meets specific customer requirements. The metals service center industry is comprised of many companies, the majority of which have limited product lines and inventories, with customers located in a specific geographic area. In general, competition is based on quality, service, price and geographic proximity. The metals service center industry typically experiences cash flow trends that are counter-cyclical to the revenue and volume growth of the industry. Companies in the industry primarily have working capital assets. During an industry downturn, companies generally reduce working capital assets and generate cash as inventory and accounts receivable balances decline. As a result, operating cash flow and liquidity tend to increase during a downturn, which typically facilitates industry participants’ ability to cover fixed costs and repay outstanding debt. We compete with many other metals service centers and to a lesser extent with primary metal producers. Primary metal producers typically sell to larger customers that require regular shipments of higher volumes of steel than the traditional service center customer. Competitive Strengths Leading Market Position in North America We believe we are one of the largest service center companies for carbon and stainless steel as well as aluminum based on sales in the North American market where we have a broad geographic presence with over 90 facilities. Our service centers are located near our customer locations, enabling us to provide timely delivery to customers across numerous geographic markets. Additionally, our widespread network of locations in the United States, Canada and Mexico helps us to utilize our expertise to more efficiently serve customers with complex supply chain requirements across multiple manufacturing locations. We believe this is a key differentiator for customers who need a supplier that can reliably and consistently support them. Our ability to transfer inventory among our facilities better enables us to more timely and profitably source and process specialized items at regional locations throughout our network than if we were required to maintain inventory of all products and specialized equipment at each location. We believe with our significant footprint in the North American market, combined with our significant scale and operating leverage, a cyclical recovery of the service center industry supported by long-term growth trends in our end markets should allow us to experience higher growth rates relative to North American economic improvement. However, there can be no guarantee that we will experience such higher growth rates. Broad Geographic Reach across Attractive End Markets. Our operations serve a diverse range of industries, including commercial ground transportation manufacturing, metal fabrication and machine shops, industrial machinery and equipment manufacturing, consumer durable production, HVAC manufacturing, construction equipment manufacturing, food processing and agricultural equipment manufacturing and oil and gas. We believe these industries will provide demand for our products and services as the North American manufacturing economy continues to grow. In addition, we expect to benefit from continued growth in international markets that will help spur demand at domestic manufacturing facilities that sell into the global market. We believe that our ability to quickly adjust our offering based on regional and industry specific trends creates stability while also providing the opportunity to access specific growth markets. Established Platform for Organic and Acquisition Growth. Although there can be no guarantee of growth, we believe a number of our strategies, such as investing in value added processing capabilities, analytically targeting attractive customers and end markets with our supply chain optimization service model, expanding our large network of service centers both through capital expenditures and acquisitions, and pricing our products and services based on the value we deliver to our customers will provide us with growth opportunities. 5 Given the highly fragmented nature of the service center industry, we believe there are numerous additional opportunities to acquire businesses and incorporate them into our existing infrastructure. Given our large scale and geographic reach, we believe we can add value to these businesses in a number of ways, including providing greater purchasing power, improving expense and working capital management, access to additional end markets and broadening product mix. Lean Operating Structure Providing Operating Leverage. From historical significant changes to our footprint and decentralized operational management through tactical productivity and spending improvements, Ryerson has demonstrated the ability to effectively manage expenses. Even on volumes which were slightly higher than 2015, our warehousing, delivery, selling, general and administrative expenses declined by $14 million, or 3.2%.  In an improving metals service center environment characterized by increases in demand and/or pricing, we believe that most additional expenses to service higher revenue and margins would come from variable expenses while further leveraging economies of scale on our existing fixed expenses.We have also focused on process improvements in inventory management. Average inventory days excluding LIFO decreased from 80 days in 2015 to 76 days in 2016.  Our average inventory days have improved on an overall basis from 100 days in 2006. This reduction has decreased our exposure to metals price movements as well as increased capacity in our facilities to devote to higher margin products and capabilities. These organizational and operating changes have improved our operating structure, working capital management and efficiency. As a result of our initiatives, we have increased our financial flexibility and believe we have a favorable cost structure compared to many of our peers. This achievement will provide significant operating leverage if revenue improves. Extensive Breadth of Products and Services for Diverse Customer Base. We believe our broad product mix and marketing approach provides customers with a “one-stop shop” solution few other service center companies are able to offer. We provide a broad range of processing and fabrication services to meet the needs of our approximately 40,000 customers and typically fulfill more than 1,000,000 orders per year. We also provide supply chain solutions, including just-in-time delivery, and value-added components to many original equipment manufacturers. For the year ended December 31, 2016, no single customer accounted for more than 2% of our sales, and our top 10 customers accounted for less than 12% of our sales. Strong Relationships with Suppliers. We are among the largest purchasers of metals in North America and have long-term relationships with many of our North American suppliers. We believe we are frequently one of the largest customers of our suppliers and that concentrating our orders among a core group of suppliers is an effective method for obtaining favorable pricing and service. We believe we have the opportunity to further leverage this strength through continued focus on price and volume using an analytics-driven approach to procurement. In addition, we view our strategic suppliers as supply chain partners. Our coordinated effort focused on logistics, lead times, rolling schedules, and scrap return programs ultimately results in value-based buying that is advantageous for us. Metals producers worldwide are consolidating, and large, geographically diversified customers, such as Ryerson, are desirable partners for these larger suppliers. Our relationships with suppliers often provide us with access to metals when supply is constrained. Through our knowledge of the global metals marketplace and capabilities of specific mills we believe we have developed a global purchasing strategy that allows us to secure favorable prices across our product lines. Experienced Management Team with Deep Industry Knowledge. Our senior management team has extensive industry and operational experience and has been instrumental in optimizing and implementing our strategy in the last four years. Our senior management has an average of more than 20 years of experience in the metals or service center industries. Our CEO, Mr. Edward Lehner, who joined the Company in August 2012 as CFO and became CEO in June 2015, has nearly 30 years of experience, predominantly in the metals industry. Mr. Erich Schnaufer, who joined the Company in 2005 and became CFO in January 2016, has over 25 years of financial and accounting experience and over 10 years with Ryerson. Under their leadership, we have increased our focus on positioning the Company for growth and enhanced profitability. 6 Industry Outlook We believe that the United States economy has grown since the recession that began in 2008. According to the Institute for Supply Management, the Purchasing Managers’ Index (“PMI”) was above 50% for 29 of the last 36 months, which indicates that the U.S. manufacturing economy was generally expanding over the last three years. The PMI measures the economic health of the manufacturing sector and is a composite index based on five indicators: new orders, inventory levels, production, supplier deliveries and the employment environment. PMI readings can be a good indicator of industrial activity and general economic growth. That being said, another indicator of manufacturing activity, the US Federal Reserve’s Industrial Production Index, has shown monthly year-over-year contraction in dollars spent from September 2015 through November 2016.Additionally, the overall U.S. economy is projected to continue growing as evidenced by the Federal Reserve’s midrange forecasted real GDP growth rates of 2.1%, 2.0%, and 1.9% for 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. Steel demand in North America is largely dependent on growth of the automotive, industrial equipment, consumer appliance and construction end markets. One of our key end markets is within the industrial equipment sector and according to the latest Livingston Survey, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, U.S. industrial production contracted by 0.9% in 2016 and is expected to grow by 1.5% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2017. China continues to be a key driver in the growth of global metals demand. According to the International Monetary Fund, China’s GDP grew 6.7% in 2016 and is projected to grow 6.5% in 2017 and 6.0% in 2018. Products and Services We carry a full line of carbon steel, stainless steel, alloy steels and aluminum, and a limited line of nickel and red metals. These materials are inventoried in a number of shapes, including coils, sheets, rounds, hexagons, square and flat bars, plates, structurals and tubing. The following table shows our percentage of sales by major product lines for 2016, 2015 and 2014:  Product Line 2016  2015  2014 Carbon Steel Flat  28%  25%  25%Carbon Steel Plate  9   11   12 Carbon Steel Long  13   16   15 Stainless Steel Flat  17   16   16 Stainless Steel Plate  4   4   4 Stainless Steel Long  3   3   4 Aluminum Flat  16   16   15 Aluminum Plate  3   3   3 Aluminum Long  5   4   4 Other  2   2   2 Total  100%  100%  100%More than 75% of the materials sold by us are processed. We use processing and fabricating techniques such as sawing, slitting, blanking, cutting to length, leveling, flame cutting, laser cutting, edge trimming, edge rolling, polishing and shearing to process materials to specified thickness, length, width, shape and surface quality pursuant to specific customer orders. Among the most common processing techniques used by us are slitting, which involves cutting coiled metals to specified widths along the length of the coil, and leveling, which involves flattening metals and cutting them to exact lengths. We also use third-party fabricators to outsource certain processes that we are not able to perform internally (such as pickling, painting, forming and drilling) to enhance our value-added services. The plate burning and fabrication processes are particularly important to us. These processes require sophisticated and expensive processing equipment. As a result, rather than making investments in such equipment, manufacturers have increasingly outsourced these processes to metals service centers. As part of securing customer orders, we also provide services to our customers to assure cost effective material application while maintaining or improving the customers’ product quality. Our services include: just-in-time inventory programs, production of kits containing multiple products for ease of assembly by the customer, consignment arrangements and the placement of our employees at a customer’s site for inventory management and production and technical assistance. We also provide special stocking programs in which products that would not otherwise be stocked by us are held in inventory to meet certain customers’ needs. These 7 services are designed to reduce customers’ costs by minimizing their investment in inventory and improving their production efficiency. Additional financial information is presented in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference.Customers Our customer base is diverse, numbering approximately 40,000 and includes most metal-consuming industries, most of which are cyclical. For the year ended December 31, 2016, no single customer accounted for more than 2% of our sales, and the top 10 customers accounted for less than 12% of our sales. Substantially all of our sales are attributable to our U.S. operations and substantially all of our long-lived assets are located in the United States. The following table shows the Company’s percentage of sales by metal consuming industry for 2016, 2015 and 2014:    Percentage of Sales Metal Consuming Industry 2016  2015  2014 Commercial ground transportation  16%  18%  17%Metal fabrication and machine shops  18   18   18 Industrial machinery and equipment  18   17   18 Consumer durable  11   10   11 HVAC  7   8   7 Construction equipment  9   8   7 Food processing and agricultural equipment  9   7   7 Oil & gas  5   7   9 Other  7   7   6 Total  100%  100%  100% Some of our largest customers have procurement programs with us, typically ranging from three months to one year in duration. Pricing for these contracts is generally based on a pricing formula rather than a fixed price for the program duration. However, certain customer contracts are at fixed prices; in order to minimize our financial exposure, we generally match these fixed-price sales programs with fixed-price supply programs. In general, sales to customers are priced at the time of sale based on prevailing market prices.Suppliers For the year ended December 31, 2016, our top 25 suppliers accounted for approximately 76% of our purchase dollars. We purchase the majority of our inventories at prevailing market prices from key suppliers with which we have established relationships to obtain improvements in price, quality, delivery and service. We are generally able to meet our materials requirements because we use many suppliers, because there is a substantial overlap of product offerings from these suppliers, and because there are a number of other suppliers able to provide identical or similar products. Because of the competitive nature of the business, when metal prices increase due to product demand, mill surcharges, supplier consolidation or other factors that in turn lead to supply constraints or longer mill lead times, we may not be able to pass our increased material costs fully to customers. In recent years, there have been significant consolidations among suppliers of carbon steel, stainless steel, and aluminum. Continued consolidation among suppliers could lead to disruptions in our ability to meet our material requirements as the sources of our products become more concentrated from fewer producers. We believe we will be able to meet our material requirements and believe we will continue to be among the largest customers of our suppliers. Sales and Marketing We maintain our own sales force. In addition to our office sales staff, we market and sell our products through the use of our field sales force that we believe has extensive product and customer knowledge and through a comprehensive catalog of our products. Our office and field sales staffs, which together consist of approximately 650 employees, include technical and metallurgical personnel. A portion of our customers experience seasonal slowdowns. Our sales, as measured in terms of tonnage, in the months of July, November and December traditionally have been lower than in other months because of a reduced number of shipping days and holiday or vacation closures for some customers. Consequently, our sales in the first two quarters of the year are usually higher than in the third and fourth quarters. 8 Capital Expenditures In recent years we have made capital expenditures to maintain, improve and expand processing capabilities. Additions by us to property, plant and equipment, together with retirements for the five years ended December 31, 2016, excluding the initial purchase price of acquisitions and the initial effect of fully consolidating a joint venture, are set forth below. The net capital change during such period aggregated to an increase of $76.0 million.    Additions  Retirementsor Sales  Net   (In millions) 2016 $23.0  $5.0  $18.0 2015  22.3   9.1   13.2 2014  21.6   6.3   15.3 2013  20.2   13.5   6.7 2012  40.8   18.0   22.8  We currently anticipate capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, of up to approximately $25 million for 2017. We expect capital expenditures will be funded from cash generated by operations and available borrowings. Employees As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 3,000 persons in North America and 325 persons in China. Our North American workforce was comprised of approximately 1,400 office employees and approximately 1,600 plant employees. Twenty-five percent of our plant employees were members of various unions, including the United Steel Workers and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Three renewal contracts covering approximately 63 employees were successfully negotiated in 2016. Six contracts covering 118 employees are currently scheduled to expire in 2017.Environmental, Health and Safety Matters Our facilities and operations are subject to many foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and to health and safety. In particular, our operations are subject to extensive requirements relating to waste disposal, recycling, air and water emissions, the handling of regulated materials, remediation, underground storage tanks, asbestos-containing building materials, workplace exposure and other matters. We believe that our operations are currently in substantial compliance with all such laws and do not presently anticipate substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future in order to meet environmental, workplace health or safety requirements or to pay for any investigations, corrective action or claims. Claims, enforcement actions, or investigations regarding personal injury, property damage, or violation of environmental laws could result in substantial costs to us, divert our management’s attention and result in significant liabilities, fines, or the suspension or interruption of our facilities. We continue to analyze and implement safeguards to mitigate any environmental, health and safety risks we may face. As a result, additional costs and liabilities may be incurred to comply with future requirements or to address newly discovered conditions, which costs and liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. For example, there is increasing likelihood that additional regulation of greenhouse gas emissions will occur at the foreign, federal, state and local level, which could affect us, our suppliers, and our customers. While the costs of compliance could be significant, given the uncertain outcome and timing of future action by the U.S. federal government and states on this issue, we cannot accurately predict the financial impact of future greenhouse gas regulations on our operations or our customers at this time. We do not currently anticipate any new programs disproportionately impacting us compared to our competitors. Some of the properties currently or previously owned or leased by us are located in industrial areas or have a long history of heavy industrial use. We may incur environmental liabilities with respect to these properties in the future including cost of investigations, corrective action, claims for natural resource damages, claims by third parties relating to property damages or claims relating to contamination at sites where we have sent waste for treatment or disposal. Based on currently available information we do not expect any investigation or remediation matters or claims related to properties presently or formerly owned or operated or to which we have sent waste for treatment or disposal would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 9 In October 2011, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) named us as one of more than 100 businesses that may be a potentially responsible party for the Portland Harbor Superfund Site (the “PHS Site”). On January 6, 2017, the EPA issued its Record of Decision (“ROD”) regarding the site. The ROD includes a combination of dredging, capping and enhanced natural recovery that would take approximately thirteen years to construct plus additional time for monitored natural recovery, at an estimated present value cost of $1.05 billion. The EPA has not yet allocated responsibility for the contamination among the potentially responsible parties, including us. We do not currently have sufficient information available to us to determine whether the ROD will be executed as currently stated, whether and to what extent we may be held responsible for any of the identified contamination, and how much (if any) of the final plan’s costs might ultimately be allocated to us. Therefore, management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or estimate a range of potential loss at this time. Excluding any potential additional remediation costs resulting from any corrective action for the properties described above, we expect spending for pollution control projects to remain at historical levels below $500,000 per year. Our United States operations are also subject to the Department of Transportation Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations. We operate a private trucking motor fleet for making deliveries to some of our customers. Our drivers do not carry any material quantities of hazardous materials. Our foreign operations are subject to similar regulations. Future regulations could increase maintenance, replacement, and fuel costs for our fleet. These costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Intellectual Property We own several U.S. and foreign trademarks, service marks and copyrights. Certain of the trademarks are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and, in certain circumstances, with the trademark offices of various foreign countries. We consider certain other information owned by us to be trade secrets. We protect our trade secrets by, among other things, entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees regarding such matters and implementing measures to restrict access to sensitive data and computer software source code on a need-to-know basis. We believe that these safeguards adequately protect our proprietary rights and vigorously defend these rights.

Ryerson Canada has facilities in Calgary (AB), Edmonton (AB), Richmond (BC), Winnipeg (MB), Saint John (NB), Brampton (ON), Burlington (ON) (includes Canadian headquarters), and Vaudreuil (QC), Canada. 10 Ryerson China In 2006, Ryerson Inc., formerly the direct subsidiary of Ryerson Holding, and VSC and its subsidiary, CAMP BVI, formed Ryerson China to enable us, through this foreign operation, to provide metals distribution services in China. We invested $28.3 million in Ryerson China for a 40% equity interest. We increased ownership of Ryerson China from 40% to 80% in the fourth quarter of 2008 for a total purchase cost of $18.5 million. We consolidated the operations of Ryerson China as of October 31, 2008. On July 12, 2010, we acquired VSC’s remaining 20% equity interest in Ryerson China for $17.5 million. As a result, Ryerson China is now an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Ryerson. Ryerson China is based in Kunshan and operates five processing and service centers in Guangzhou, Dongguan, Kunshan and Tianjin. Ryerson Mexico Ryerson Mexico, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Ryerson Holding, operates as a metals service center. Ryerson Holding formed Ryerson Mexico in 2010 to expand operations into the Mexican market. Ryerson Mexico has service centers in Monterrey, Tijuana, Hermosillo, and Queretaro.

You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the other information in this report, including the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors below will not occur. These risks could have a material and adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Risks Related to Our Business and IndustryWe service industries that are highly cyclical, and any downturn in our customers’ industries could reduce our revenues and profitability.Many of our products are sold to industries that experience significant fluctuations in demand based on economic conditions, energy prices, seasonality, consumer demand and other factors beyond our control. These industries include manufacturing, electrical production and transportation. This cyclicality can significantly affect demand of materials for us. We do not expect the cyclical nature of our industry to change and any downturn in our customers’ industries could reduce our revenues and profitability. The volatility of the market could result in a material impairment of goodwill. We evaluate goodwill annually on October 1 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment. Events or changes in circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to our historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner or the use of our assets or the strategy for our overall business, and significant negative industry or economic trends. We test for impairment of goodwill by assessing various qualitative factors with respect to development in our business and the overall economy and calculating the fair value of a reporting unit using a combination of an income approach based on discounted future cash flows and a market approach at the date of valuation. Under the discounted cash flow method, the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated based on expected future economic benefits discounted to a present value at a rate of return commensurate with the risk associated with the investment. Projected cash flows are discounted to present value using an estimated weighted average cost of capital, which considers both returns to equity and debt investors. 11 Significant changes in any one of the assumptions made as part of our analysis, which could occur as a result of actual events, or further declines in the market conditions for our products, could significantly impact our impairment analysis. An impairment charge, if incurred, could be material. The metals distribution business is very competitive and increased competition could reduce our revenues and gross margins. The principal markets that we serve are highly competitive. The metals distribution industry is fragmented and competitive, consisting of a large number of small companies and a few relatively large companies. Competition is based principally on price, service, quality, production capabilities, inventory availability and timely delivery. Competition in the various markets in which we participate comes from companies of various sizes, some of which have greater financial resources than we have and some of which have more established brand names in the local markets we serve. Increased competition could reduce our market share, force us to lower our prices or to offer increased services at a higher cost, which could reduce our profitability. Changing metals prices may have a significant impact on our liquidity, net sales, gross margins, operating income and net income. The metals industry as a whole is cyclical and, at times, pricing and availability of metal can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control, including general domestic and international economic conditions, labor costs, sales levels, competition, levels of inventory held by other metals service centers, consolidation of metals producers, higher raw material costs for the producers of metals, import duties and tariffs and currency exchange rates. This volatility can significantly affect the availability and cost of materials for us. We maintain substantial inventories of metal to accommodate the short lead times and just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers. Accordingly, we purchase metals in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon historic buying practices, contracts with customers and market conditions. When metals prices decline, customer demands for lower prices and our competitors’ responses to those demands result in lower sale prices and, consequently, lower margins as we use existing metals inventory. Declines in prices or further reductions in sales volumes could adversely impact our ability to maintain our liquidity and to remain in compliance with certain financial covenants under our $750 million revolving credit facility (the “Ryerson Credit Facility”), as well as result in us incurring inventory or goodwill impairment charges. Changing metals prices therefore could significantly impact our liquidity, net sales, gross margins, operating income and net income. We may not be able to successfully consummate and complete the integration of future acquisitions, and if we are unable to do so, we may be unable to increase our growth rates. We have grown through a combination of internal expansion, acquisitions and joint ventures. We intend to continue to grow through selective acquisitions, but we may not be able to identify appropriate acquisition candidates, obtain financing on satisfactory terms, consummate acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses effectively and profitably into our existing operations. Restrictions contained in the agreements governing our notes, the Ryerson Credit Facility or our other existing or future debt may also inhibit our ability to make certain investments, including acquisitions and participations in joint ventures. Our future success will depend on our ability to complete the integration of these future acquisitions successfully into our operations. After any acquisition, customers may choose to diversify their supply chains to reduce reliance on a single supplier for a portion of their metals needs. We may not be able to retain all of our and an acquisition’s customers, which may adversely affect our business and sales. Integrating acquisitions, particularly large acquisitions, requires us to enhance our operational and financial systems and employ additional qualified personnel, management and financial resources, and may adversely affect our business by diverting management away from day-to-day operations. Further, failure to successfully integrate acquisitions may adversely affect our profitability by creating significant operating inefficiencies that could increase our operating expenses as a percentage of sales and reduce our operating income. In addition, we may not realize expected cost savings from acquisitions. We may not be able to retain or expand our customer base if the North American manufacturing industry continues to erode through moving offshore or through acquisition and merger or consolidation activity in our customers’ industries. Our customer base primarily includes manufacturing and industrial firms. Some of our customers operate in industries that are undergoing consolidation through acquisition and merger activity; some are considering or have considered relocating production operations overseas or outsourcing particular functions overseas; and some customers have closed as they were unable to compete successfully with overseas competitors. Our facilities are predominately located in the United States and Canada. To the extent that our customers cease U.S. operations, relocate or move operations overseas to regions in which we do not have a presence, we could lose their business. Acquirers of manufacturing and industrial firms may have suppliers of choice that do not include us, which could impact our customer base and market share. 12 Certain of our operations are located outside of the United States, which subjects us to risks associated with international activities. Certain of our operations are located outside of the United States, primarily in Canada, China and Mexico. We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making corrupt payments or otherwise corruptly giving any other thing of value to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment, and requires companies to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices. The FCPA applies to covered companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for some actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives. If we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA, governmental authorities in the United States could seek to impose civil and/or criminal penalties. We may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations in the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar and the Chinese renminbi. We have significant operations in Canada which incur the majority of their metal supply costs in U.S. dollars but earn the majority of their sales in Canadian dollars. Additionally, we have significant assets in China. We may from time to time experience losses when the value of the U.S. dollar strengthens against the Canadian dollar or the Chinese renminbi, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, we will be subject to translation risk when we consolidate our Canadian and Chinese subsidiaries’ net assets into our balance sheet. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar or Chinese renminbi could reduce the value of these assets as reported in our financial statements, which could, as a result, reduce our stockholders’ equity.The Chinese government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities, particularly with regards to the land our facilities are located on. The Chinese government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. We believe that our operations in China are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations. Moreover, the Chinese court system does not provide the same property and contract right guarantees as do courts in the United States and, accordingly, disputes may be protracted and resolution of claims may result in significant economic loss. Additionally, there is no private ownership of land in China and all land ownership is held by the government of China, its agencies, and collectives, which issue land use rights that are generally renewable. We lease the land where our Chinese facilities are located from the Chinese government. If the Chinese government decided to terminate our land use rights agreements, our assets could become impaired and our ability to meet customer orders could be impacted. Our revenue and operating results may fluctuate, which could result in a decline in our profitability and make it more difficult for us to grow our business. Our revenue and operating results have historically varied from quarter to quarter. Periods of decline could result in an overall decline in profitability and make it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness and grow our business. We expect our quarterly results to continue to fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors, including:  •changes in commodity prices, especially metals; •general economic conditions in the markets where we operate; and  •the cyclical nature of our customers’ business.Damage to our information technology infrastructure could harm our business. The unavailability of any of our computer-based systems for any significant period of time could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In particular, our ability to manage inventory levels successfully largely depends on the efficient operation of our computer hardware and software systems. We use management information systems to track inventory information at individual facilities, communicate customer information and aggregate daily sales, margin and promotional information. Difficulties associated with upgrades, installations of major software or hardware, and integration with new systems could have a material adverse effect on results of operations. We will be required to expend substantial resources to integrate our information systems with the systems of companies we have acquired. The integration of these systems may disrupt our business or lead to operating inefficiencies. In addition, these systems are vulnerable to, among other things, damage or interruption from fire, flood, tornado and other natural disasters, 13 power loss, computer system and network failures, operator negligence, physical and electronic loss of data, or security breaches and computer viruses. We are subject to cybersecurity risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks.We depend on the proper functioning and availability of our information technology platform, including communications and data processing systems, in operating our business. These systems include software programs that are integral to the efficient operation of our business. We have established security measures, controls and procedures to safeguard our information technology systems and to prevent unauthorized access to such systems and any data processed or stored in such systems, and we periodically evaluate and test the adequacy of such systems, measures, controls and procedures; however, there can be no guarantee that such systems, measures, controls and procedures will be effective. Security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of our information, litigation and potential liability. In addition, cyber incidents that impact the availability, reliability, speed, accuracy or other proper functioning of these systems could have a significant impact on our operations, and potentially on our results.  We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyberattacks. A significant cyber incident, including system failure, security breach, disruption by malware or other damage could interrupt or delay our operations, result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, damage our reputation, cause a loss of customers or give rise to monetary fines and other penalties, which could be significant.Any significant work stoppages can harm our business. As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 3,000 persons in North America and 325 persons in China. Our North American workforce was comprised of approximately 1,400 office employees and approximately 1,600 plant employees. Twenty-five percent of our plant employees were members of various unions, including the United Steel Workers and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.Three renewal contracts covering approximately 63 employees were successfully negotiated in 2016. Six contracts covering 118 employees are currently scheduled to expire in 2017.Certain employee retirement benefit plans are underfunded and the actual cost of those benefits could exceed current estimates, which would require us to fund the shortfall. As of December 31, 2016, our pension plan had an unfunded liability of $216 million. Our actual costs for benefits required to be paid may exceed those projected and future actuarial assessments to the extent that those costs exceed the current assessment. Under those circumstances, the adjustments required to be made to our recorded liability for these benefits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and cash payments to fund these plans could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows. We may be required to make substantial future contributions to improve the plan’s funded status. Future funding for postretirement employee benefits other than pensions also may require substantial payments from current cash flow. We provide postretirement life insurance and medical benefits to eligible retired employees. Our unfunded postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2016 was $74 million. Our actual costs for benefits required to be paid may exceed those projected and future actuarial assessments to the extent that those costs exceed the current assessment. Under those circumstances, adjustments will be required to be made to our recorded liability for these benefits. Any prolonged disruption of our processing centers could harm our business. We have dedicated processing centers that permit us to produce standardized products in large volumes while maintaining low operating costs. We may suffer prolonged disruption in the operations of any of these facilities, whether due to labor or technical difficulties, destruction or damage to any of the facilities or otherwise. If we are unable to retain and attract management and key personnel, it may adversely affect our business. We believe that our success is due, in part, to our experienced management team. Losing the services of one or more members of our management team such as our CEO, Edward J. Lehner, and CFO, Erich S. Schnaufer, could adversely affect our business and possibly prevent us from improving our operational, financial and information management systems and controls. In the future, we may need to retain and hire additional qualified sales, marketing, administrative, operating and technical personnel, and to train and manage new personnel. Our ability to implement our business plan is dependent on our ability to retain and hire a large number of qualified employees each year.14 Our international operations and potential joint ventures may cause us to incur costs and risks that may distract management from effectively operating our North American business, and such operations or joint ventures may not be profitable. We maintain foreign operations in Canada, China and Mexico. International operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business in, and with, foreign countries, including price controls, exchange controls, export controls, economic sanctions, duties, tariffs, limitations on participation in local enterprises, nationalization, expropriation and other governmental action, and changes in currency exchange rates. While we believe that our current arrangements with local partners provide us with experienced business partners in foreign countries, events or issues, including disagreements with our partners, may occur that require attention of our senior executives and may result in expenses or losses that erode the profitability of our foreign operations or cause our capital investments abroad to be unprofitable. Lead time and the cost of our products could increase if we were to lose one of our primary suppliers. If, for any reason, our primary suppliers of aluminum, carbon steel, stainless steel or other metals should curtail or discontinue their delivery of such metals in the quantities needed and at prices that are competitive, our business could suffer. The number of available suppliers could be reduced by factors such as industry consolidation and bankruptcies affecting steel and metal producers. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our top 25 suppliers represented approximately 76% of our purchases. We could be significantly and adversely affected if delivery were disrupted from a major supplier. If, in the future, we were unable to obtain sufficient amounts of the necessary metals at competitive prices and on a timely basis from our traditional suppliers, we may not be able to obtain such metals from alternative sources at competitive prices to meet our delivery schedules, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. We could incur substantial costs related to environmental, health and safety laws. Our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental, health and safety laws. These include laws that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and establish standards for the treatment, storage and disposal of regulated materials and the investigation and remediation of contaminated soil, surface water and groundwater. Failure to maintain or achieve compliance with these laws or with the permits required for our operations could result in substantial increases in operating costs and capital expenditures. In addition, we may be subject to fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third party claims for property damage or personal injury, worker’s compensation or personal injury claims, cleanup costs or temporary or permanent discontinuance of operations. Certain of our facilities are located in industrial areas, have a history of heavy industrial use and have been in operation for many years and, over time, we and other predecessor operators of these facilities have generated, used, handled and disposed of hazardous and other regulated wastes. Environmental liabilities could exist, including cleanup obligations at these facilities or at off-site locations where materials from our operations were disposed of, which could result in future expenditures that cannot be currently quantified and which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Such liabilities may be imposed without regard to fault or the legality of a party’s conduct and may, in certain circumstances, be joint and several. Future changes to environmental, health and safety laws, including those related to climate change, could result in material liabilities and costs, constrain operations or make such operations more costly for us, our suppliers and our customers. In October 2011, the EPA named us as one of more than 100 businesses that may be a potentially responsible party for the Portland Harbor Superfund Site (the “PHS Site”), which includes in-river and upland portions. On February 9, 2016, the EPA published its Final Remedial Investigation Report. On June 8, 2016, the EPA published both the Draft Feasibility Study and associated Superfund Proposed Plan. Following a public comment period, on January 6, 2017, the EPA released its Record of Decision selecting a remedy for the in-river portion of the PHS Site that is expected to cost approximately $1.05 billion in total and take approximately 13 years to complete. The allocation of responsibility for the contamination among the potentially responsible parties, including JT Ryerson, has not yet been determined. We do not currently have sufficient information available to us to determine the total cost of any required investigation or remediation of the PHS Site and therefore, management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or estimate a range of potential loss at this time. Regulations related to conflict-free minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and place us at a competitive disadvantage. On August 22, 2012, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), the United States SEC adopted new requirements for reporting companies that use certain minerals and metals, known as “conflict minerals”, in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. These requirements require companies to diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to conclusively verify the origins for all metals used in our products and we may face reputational challenges with our customers. Additionally, as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering “conflict free” metals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary metals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Accordingly, we could incur significant cost related to the compliance process, including potential difficulty or added costs in satisfying the disclosure requirements. Moreover, we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require 15 that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so. On January 31, 2017, the SEC’s Acting Commissioner issued a statement directing SEC staff to reconsider current positions on reporting requirements related to “conflict minerals” and at this time, we do not have sufficient information available to us to determine whether the outcome of such reconsideration may have adverse effects on our business.We are subject to litigation that could strain our resources and distract management. From time to time, we are involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits and other disputes arising in the ordinary course of business. These suits concern issues including product liability, contract disputes, employee-related matters and personal injury matters. It is not feasible to predict the outcome of all pending suits and claims, and the ultimate resolution of these matters as well as future lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows or reputation. We may face product liability claims that are costly and create adverse publicity. If any of the products that we sell cause harm to any of our customers, we could be exposed to product liability lawsuits. If we were found liable under product liability claims, we could be required to pay substantial monetary damages. Further, even if we successfully defended ourselves against this type of claim, we could be forced to spend a substantial amount of money in litigation expenses, our management could be required to spend valuable time in the defense against these claims and our reputation could suffer.  Our risk management strategies may result in losses. From time to time, we may use fixed-price and/or fixed-volume supplier contracts to offset contracts with customers. Additionally, we may use foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge Canadian dollar and floating rate debt exposures. These risk management strategies pose certain risks, including the risk that losses on a hedge position may exceed the amount invested in such instruments. Moreover, a party in a hedging transaction may be unavailable or unwilling to settle our obligations, which could cause us to suffer corresponding losses. A hedging instrument may not be effective in eliminating all of the risks inherent in any particular position. Our profitability may be adversely affected during any period as a result of use of such instruments.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common StockThe market price for our common stock may be volatile.Historically, there has been volatility in the market price for our common stock. Furthermore, the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in the future in response to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the risk factors described herein. Examples include: •changes in commodity prices, especially metals; •announcement of our quarterly operating results or the operating results of other metals service centers;  •changes in financial estimates or recommendations by stock market analysts regarding us or our competitors; •the operating and stock performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable; •press releases, earnings releases or publicity relating to us or our competitors or relating to trends in the metals service center industry; •inability to meet securities analysts’ and investors’ quarterly or annual estimates or targets of our performance; •sales of our common stock by large or controlling shareholders; •the amount of shares acquired for short-term investments; •general domestic or international economic, market and political conditions; and •announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, dispositions or joint ventures, or other material events impacting the domestic or global metals industry.In the past, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their specific operating performance. These factors may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of actual operating performance.16 In addition, stock markets from time to time experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. In the past, some shareholders have brought securities class action lawsuits against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. We may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation, regardless of whether our defense is ultimately successful, could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources.We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations. We currently have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2016, our total indebtedness was approximately $963.5 million and we had approximately $225 million of unused capacity under the Ryerson Credit Facility. Our substantial indebtedness may:  •make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our outstanding notes and our other indebtedness;  •limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes;  •limit our ability to use our cash flow for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes;  •require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;  •limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;  •place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and  •increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of the Ryerson Credit Facility and the indenture governing our outstanding notes restrict but do not prohibit us from doing so, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify. The covenants in the Ryerson Credit Facility and the indenture governing our notes impose, and covenants contained in agreements governing indebtedness that we incur in the future may impose, restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility. The Ryerson Credit Facility and the indenture governing our outstanding notes contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries, including JT Ryerson, to:  •incur additional debt;  •pay dividends on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock;  •make certain investments or other restricted payments;  •create liens or use assets as security in other transactions;  •merge, consolidate or transfer or dispose of substantially all of our assets; and  •engage in transactions with affiliates. The terms of the Ryerson Credit Facility require that, in the event availability under the facility declines to a certain level, we maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter. Total credit availability is limited by the amount of eligible accounts receivable, inventory, and qualified cash pledged as collateral under the agreement insofar as the Company is subject to a borrowing base comprised of the aggregate of these two amounts, less applicable reserves. As of December 31, 2016, total credit availability was $225 million.Additionally, subject to certain exceptions, the indenture governing the outstanding notes restricts JT Ryerson’s ability to pay Ryerson Holding dividends. Our future indebtedness may contain covenants more restrictive in certain respects than the restrictions contained in the Ryerson Credit Facility and the indenture governing the notes. Operating results below current levels or other adverse factors, including a significant increase in interest rates, could result in our being unable to comply with financial covenants that are contained in the Ryerson Credit Facility or that may be contained in any future indebtedness. In addition, complying with these 17 covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to holders of our notes and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our outstanding notes, the Ryerson Credit Facility and our other outstanding indebtedness are expected to account for significant cash interest expenses. Accordingly, we will have to generate significant cash flows from operations to meet our debt service requirements. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service and working capital requirements, we may be required to sell assets, seek additional capital, reduce capital expenditures, restructure or refinance all or a portion of our existing indebtedness, or seek additional financing. Moreover, insufficient cash flow may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. The right to receive payment on the 2022 Notes and the guarantees will be subordinated to the liabilities of non-guarantor subsidiaries.The notes and related guarantees are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness of our subsidiaries that are note guarantors of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes (the “2022 Notes”). While the indenture governing the 2022 Notes limits the indebtedness and activities of these non-guarantor subsidiaries, holders of indebtedness of, and trade creditors of, non-guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under bank financing agreements, are entitles to payments of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before those assets are made available for distribution to any guarantor, as direct or indirect shareholder. While the non-guarantor subsidiaries have agreed under the indenture not to pledge or encumber their assets (other than with respect to permitted liens) without equally and ratably securing the notes, they will not guarantee the 2022 Notes notwithstanding any such pledge or encumbrance in favor of the 2022 Notes.The non-guarantor subsidiaries represented, respectively, 13.1% and 6.8% of our net sales and EBITDA for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, these non-guarantor subsidiaries represented respectively, 15.5% and 9.6% of our assets and liabilities, as of December 31, 2016.Accordingly, in the even that any of the non-guarantor subsidiaries or joint venture entities become insolvent, liquidates or otherwise reorganizes: •the creditors of the guarantors (including the holders of the 2022 Notes) will have no right to proceed against such subsidiary’s assets; and  •the creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of assets of such subsidiary, as direct or indirect shareholder, and will be entitles to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.Because a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain prevailing short-term interest rates, we are vulnerable to interest rate increases. A portion of our indebtedness, including the Ryerson Credit Facility, bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain short-term prevailing interest rates. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $312.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Ryerson Credit Facility, with an additional $225 million available for borrowing under such facility. Assuming a consistent level of debt, a 100 basis point change in the interest rate on our floating rate debt effective from the beginning of the year would increase or decrease our interest expense under the Ryerson Credit Facility by approximately $3.3 million on an annual basis. If interest rates increase dramatically, we could be unable to service our debt, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Platinum owns a significant percentage of our stock and has the right to nominate a majority of the members of the Corporation’s board and will be able to exert control over matters subject to stockholder approval.Platinum owns approximately 21,037,500 shares of our common stock, which is approximately 57% of our issued and outstanding common stock. Therefore, Platinum may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, Platinum may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that our stockholders may believe are in their best interest as stockholders.The Company is party to an investor rights agreement (the “Investor Rights Agreement”) with certain affiliates of Platinum which provides, among other things, that for so long as Platinum collectively beneficially owns (i) at least 30% of the voting power of 18 the outstanding capital stock of the Company, Platinum will have the right to nominate for election to the board of directors of the Company no fewer than that number of directors that would constitute a majority of the number of directors if there were no vacancies on the board, (ii) at least 15% but less than 30% of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the Company, Platinum will have the right to nominate two directors and (iii) at least 5% but less than 15% of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the Company, Platinum will have the right to nominate one director. The agreement also provides that if the size of the board of directors is increased or decreased at any time, Platinum’s nomination rights will be proportionately increased or decreased, respectively, rounded up to the nearest whole number. As a result of Platinum’s ownership of a majority of the Company’s outstanding capital stock as well its board nomination rights pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, Platinum may significantly influence or effectively control our policies and operations, including the appointment of management, future issuances of our common stock or other securities and the payment of dividends. In addition, Platinum has significant control over our decisions to enter into any other corporate transaction. The interests of Platinum may not in all cases be aligned with the interests of the other holders of our common stock. For example, a sale of a substantial number of shares of stock in the future by Platinum could cause our stock price to decline. Further, Platinum could cause us to make acquisitions that increase the amount of the indebtedness that is secured or senior to the Company’s existing debt or sell revenue-generating assets, impairing our ability to make payments under such debt. Additionally, Platinum is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Accordingly, Platinum may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, Platinum may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to holders of our common stock.We are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements because we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the NYSE rules and, as a result, our stockholders do not have the protections afforded by these corporate governance requirements.Because Platinum controls more than 50% of the voting power of our common stock, we are considered to be a “controlled company” for purposes of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) listing requirements. Under the NYSE rules, a “controlled company” may elect not to comply with certain NYSE corporate governance requirements, including (1) the requirement that a majority of our Board of Directors consist of independent directors, (2) the requirement that the nominating and corporate governance committee of our Board of Directors be composed entirely of independent directors, (3) the requirement that the compensation committee of our Board of Directors be composed entirely of independent directors and (4) the requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nomination/corporate governance and compensation committees. Given that Platinum controls a majority of the voting power of our common stock, we are permitted, and have elected, to opt out of compliance with certain NYSE corporate governance requirements. Accordingly, holders of our common stock do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements.Our corporate documents and Delaware law  contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company.Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our Board of Directors. These provisions: •establish a classified Board of Directors so that not all members of our Board of Directors are elected at one time; •authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock; •provide that the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our amended and restated bylaws; •prohibit stockholders from acting by written consent if less than a majority of the voting power of our outstanding stock is controlled by Platinum; and •establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.Any issuance of preferred stock could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our common stock, which could depress the price of our common stock.19 Our Board of Directors will have the authority to issue preferred stock and to determine the preferences, limitations and relative rights of shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Our preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the rights of our common stock. The potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of us, discouraging bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price, and adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.We have not and do not intend to pay regular cash dividends on our stock.We do not anticipate declaring or paying regular cash dividends on our common stock or any other equity security in the foreseeable future. The amounts that may be available to us to pay cash dividends are restricted under our debt agreements. Any payment of cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, future prospects, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Therefore, you should not rely on dividend income from shares of our common stock. For more information, see “Dividend Policy.” Your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in us may be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and you sell your shares at a profit but there is no guarantee that the market price for our common stock will ever exceed the price that you pay for our common stock in this offering. "
