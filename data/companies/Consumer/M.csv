9,M,MACY'S INC,2024-03-22,"    Risk Factors
.In evaluating the Company, the risks described below and the matters described under “Forward-Looking Statements” should be considered carefully. Such risks and matters are numerous and diverse, may be experienced continuously or intermittently, and may vary in intensity and effect. Although the risks are organized by heading, and each risk is described separately, many of the risks are interrelated. Any of such risks and matters, individually or in combination, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as on the attractiveness and value of an investment in the Company's securities. You should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk has not already materialized. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future.Strategic, Operational and Competitive RisksOur strategic plans and initiatives may not be successful, which could negatively affect our profitability and growth.In 2024 we announced A Bold New Chapter, a strategy designed to enhance the customer experience, deliver sustainable, profitable growth and unlock shareholder value over the next three years. The strategy builds on the five growth factors and focuses on three strategic priorities:•Strengthen Macy's through revitalizing merchandise assortment, modernizing the shopping environment and closing approximately 150 underperforming stores and prioritizing investment in approximately 350 go-forward stores and continued expansion of small format stores;•Accelerate luxury growth by expanding Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury within the Macy's, Inc. nameplate portfolio; and•Simplify and modernize end-to-end operations through rationalizing and monetizing the supply chain asset portfolio, streamlining fulfillment, improving inventory planning and allocation, and delivering a modern, scalable technology platform.We plan to make value-enhancing investments to support these initiatives primarily focused on digital and technology, data and analytics, supply chain modernization and omni-channel capabilities. These initiatives have required and will continue to require our management, colleagues, and contractors to make changes in our business operations and to improve productivity and profitability, and are subject to the ability to attract and retain skilled personnel to support the initiatives. We face challenges in executing A Bold New Chapter strategy and initiatives in the current environment of heightened inflation, increased interest rates, economic uncertainty, geopolitical disruption and other macroeconomic conditions that may impact discretionary spending. Our ability to achieve sustainable, profitable growth is subject to the successful implementation of our strategic plans and realization of anticipated benefits and savings. If we are unable to successfully execute our strategic plans and initiatives to achieve the intended results or these investments or initiatives do not perform as expected or create implementation or operational challenges, our profitability and growth could suffer.We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs, expectations, or trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with customers, the demand for our products and services, and our market share.The success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to evolving trends in demographics, shifts in consumer preferences, expectations and needs, unexpected weather conditions, public health issues or natural disasters, while also managing appropriate inventory levels in our stores and distribution or fulfillment centers and maintaining an excellent customer experience. It is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand. As customers expect a more personalized experience, our ability to collect, use and protect relevant customer data is important to our ability to effectively meet their expectations, but is subject to the impact of legislation or regulations governing data privacy, security and other external factors. Customer preferences and expectations related to sustainability of products and operations are also increasing. If we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to meet the individual needs and expectations of or within a customer group, we may lose market share with respect to those customers. Our sales and operating results depend on our ability to manage our inventory, merchandise selection and protect against inventory shortage.Our profitability depends on our ability to manage inventory levels and merchandise selection. Overestimating customer demand for merchandise can result in the need to record unplanned and incremental inventory markdowns and sell excess inventory at clearance prices, which would negatively impact our gross margins and operating results. Underestimating customer demand for merchandise can lead to insufficient inventory to meet demands, missed sales opportunities and negative customer experiences. If we are unable to protect against inventory shortage, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.8Table of ContentsThe Company faces significant competition and challenges as consumers continue to migrate to digital shopping channels and depends on its ability to differentiate itself in retail's ever-changing environment.We conduct our retail merchandising business under highly competitive conditions. Although Macy's, Inc. is one of the nation's largest retailers, we have numerous and varied competitors at the national and local levels and digital competitors at the global level, including department stores, specialty stores, general merchandise stores, manufacturers' outlets and websites, off-price and discount stores, online retailers and catalogs, among others. Competition is characterized by many factors, including assortment, advertising, price, quality, service, location, reputation and credit availability. Any failure by us to compete effectively could negatively affect our business and results of operations.As consumers continue to migrate to digital shopping channels, we face pressures to not only compete from a price perspective with our competitors, some of whom sell the same products, but also to differentiate Macy's, Inc.'s merchandise offerings, services and shopping experiences to stay relevant as a modern department store in retail's ever-changing environment. Macy's launched On 34th and State of Day, new private brands, in 2023 and February 2024, respectively, and expects to refresh or replace all existing brands in its private brands portfolio through 2025. Macy's digital marketplace offers over 2,300 brands from third party sellers and the Company launched a Bloomingdale's marketplace in 2023 to introduce customers to new merchandise options. We continue to significantly invest in our omni-channel capabilities, seeking to improve the profitability of our digital business through delivery expense reduction, gross margin expansion and other initiatives to support digital sales growth. We continue to seek to improve the delivery experience of our customers with strategic investments to fulfill digital sales demand and elevated delivery speed expectations. Insufficient, untimely or misguided investments in these areas could significantly impact our profitability and growth.In addition, a significant decline of customer store traffic or migration of sales from brick-and-mortar stores to digital platforms could lead to additional store closures, restructuring and other costs that could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.Our ability to grow depends in part on our stores remaining relevant and attractive to customers.We have invested in facilities and fixtures upgrades, merchandise assortment and customer service in selected stores to improve customer retention rates and overall customer satisfaction. We have opened new off-mall smaller store formats – Macy's small format and Bloomie's – in selected markets to act as fill-in locations in existing markets to gain foot traffic and a new customer base, replacement locations in markets where an underperforming full-line location closure would result in a market exit, and to enter new markets. In 2022, we introduced permanent Toys “R” Us shops within all Macy's locations. While these store investments, off-mall store formats, and in-store shops are intended to improve the customer store experience and drive traffic, realization of these benefits may not occur. Because we rely on the ability of our physical retail locations to attract customers, provide full or curated merchandise selections, drive traffic to digital channels and assist in fulfillment, returns and other omni-channel functions, providing a desirable and sought-out shopping experience is important to our financial success. Changes in consumer shopping habits, a decline in mall shopping environments, financial difficulties at other anchor tenants, significant mall vacancy issues, mall violence and new on- and off-mall developments could each adversely impact the traffic at current retail locations and lead to a decline in our financial condition or performance.We may not be able to successfully execute our real estate strategy.We may continue to explore opportunities to monetize our real estate portfolio, including sales of stores as well as non-store real estate, such as warehouses, outparcels and parking garages. We also continue to evaluate our real estate portfolio to identify opportunities where the redevelopment value of our real estate exceeds the value of non-strategic operating locations. This strategy is multi-pronged and may include transactions, strategic alliances or other arrangements with mall developers or other unrelated third-parties. Where feasible, we may subdivide an existing parcel, continue to operate a store and redevelop any excess parcel for mixed-use, or close the store and redevelop an entire parcel into a mixed-use development, in either event selling the parcel once the site development plan is approved by governmental authorities. Due to the cyclical nature of real estate markets and the risks of real estate development, the performance of our real estate strategy is inherently volatile and could have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition.Our revenues and cash requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of our business.Our business is seasonal, with a high proportion of revenues and operating cash flows generated during the second half of the year, which includes the fall and the months of November and December. A disproportionate amount of our revenues is realized in the fourth quarter due to this seasonality. Should sales during this period fall below our expectations, a disproportionately negative impact on our annual results of operations could occur.We generally incur significant additional expenses in the period leading up to the months of November and December in anticipation of higher sales volume in those periods, including costs for additional inventory, advertising and employees. If we are not successful in executing our sales strategy during this period, we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.9Table of ContentsWe depend on our ability to attract, train, develop and retain quality colleagues.Our business is dependent upon attracting, training, developing and retaining quality employees at all levels of the organization, and management personnel to develop and effectively execute successful business strategies. Macy's, Inc. has a large number of employees, many of whom are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. Our ability to meet labor needs while controlling costs associated with hiring and training new employees is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation and changing demographics. In recent years, low unemployment, labor shortages, intense competition for talent and a competitive wage environment have impacted our ability to attract, recruit and retain talent. Increases in labor costs and the cost of employee benefits could impact our financial results and cash flow.Minimum wage increases by states and wage and benefit increases to attract and retain workers in a tight labor market have increased labor costs in the retail sector. These increased costs pressure our margins and could have a negative impact on our financial results.Our expenses relating to employee health benefits are significant. Recent medical plan cost increases have been driven by a rise in high-cost claimants, high-cost conditions, high utilization of outpatient facilities, physicians and in-hospital stays, and demographic shifts to an older enrollment population. Unfavorable changes in the cost of employee health benefits could negatively affect our financial results and cash flow. If revenue from our private label and co-branded credit cards decline, our financial and operational results may be negatively impacted.In 2005, in connection with the sale of most of the Company's credit card accounts and related receivable balances to Citibank, N.A. (Citibank), the Company and Citibank entered into a long-term marketing and servicing alliance pursuant to the terms of a Credit Card Program Agreement (Credit Card Program). Subsequent to this initial arrangement and associated amendments, on December 13, 2021, the Company entered into the sixth amendment to the amended and restated Credit Card Program with Citibank (the Program Agreement), pursuant to which Citibank issues, maintains and services Macy's and Bloomingdale's private label and co-branded credit cards. Under the Program Agreement, which extends until March 31, 2030, Citibank owns the credit card receivables generated from sales through the credit cards and Macy's receives fees and shares in profits based on a tiered return on the receivables portfolio net of program expenses. Credit card revenues, net were $619 million, or approximately 2.7% of net sales, for 2023. Deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect the volume of new credit accounts, the amount of credit card program balances and the ability of credit card holders to pay their balances. These conditions could result in the Company receiving lower payments under the credit card program.In addition, recent shifts from sales through our proprietary credit cards to debit products and alternative buy-now-pay-later payment methods may result in increased costs and could have a negative impact to credit card revenues due to potentially reduced credit card receivable balances. Credit card operations are subject to many federal and state laws that may impose certain requirements and limitations on credit card providers. Citibank and our subsidiary bank, FDS Bank, may be required to comply with regulations that may negatively impact the operation of our proprietary credit card. This negative impact may affect our revenue streams derived from the credit cards receivables portfolio and our financial results.In March 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finalized a rule to amend Regulation Z to lower the safe harbor dollar amount credit card companies can charge for late fees from up to $41 to $8 for a missed payment. A decrease in late fees assessed would reduce credit card revenue. The Company is closely monitoring developments on this matter.Our defined benefit plan funding requirements or plan settlement expense could impact our financial results and cash flow.Significant changes in interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and timing and amount of benefit payments could affect the funded status of our plans and could increase future funding requirements of the plans. A significant increase in future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.These plans allow eligible retiring employees to receive lump sum distributions of benefits earned. Under applicable accounting rules, if annual lump sum distributions exceed an actuarially determined threshold of the total of the annual service and interest costs, we would be required to recognize in the current period of operations a settlement expense of a portion of the unrecognized actuarial loss, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.10Table of ContentsIf our Company's reputation and brand image are not maintained at a high level, our operations and financial results may suffer.We believe our reputation and brand image are partially based on the perception that we act equitably and honestly in dealing with our customers, employees, business partners and shareholders. Our reputation and brand image may be deteriorated by any incident that erodes the trust or confidence of our customers or the general public, particularly if the incident results in significant adverse publicity or governmental inquiry. Information about us, whether or not true, may be instantly posted on social media platforms at any time, which could adversely impact our reputation or brand image. The harm could be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. Other brand risks include an active shooter incident at a location or injury or death at a parade or other branded event. If our reputation or brand image is damaged, our customers may refuse to continue shopping with us, potential employees may be unwilling to work for us, business partners may be discouraged from seeking future business dealings with us and, as a result, our business and results of operations may suffer.If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our brands and business could be damaged.We believe that our copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, trade secrets and similar intellectual property are important assets and key elements of our strategy, including those related to our private brand merchandise. We rely on copyright and trademark law, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors and others to protect our proprietary rights. If the steps we take to protect our proprietary rights are inadequate, or if we are unable to protect or preserve the value of our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other proprietary rights for any reason, our merchandise brands and business could be negatively affected.Infrastructure RisksUnforeseen disruptions in our distribution and fulfillment centers could have an adverse impact on our business and operations.Our business depends on the orderly receipt and distribution of merchandise and effective management of our distribution and fulfillment centers. Unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fire, severe weather conditions (including those that may be caused by climate change), natural disasters, health pandemics or other catastrophic events, labor disagreements, or other shipping problems may result in the loss or unavailability of inventory and/or delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores, fulfillment centers and customers.Failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business.We rely extensively on information technology systems and related personnel to collect, analyze, process, store, manage, transmit and protect transactions and data. Some of these systems are managed or provided by third-party service providers, including certain cloud platform providers. In managing our business, we also rely heavily on the integrity and security of, and consistent access to, this operational and financial data for information such as sales, customer data, employee data, demand forecasting, merchandise ordering, inventory replenishment, supply chain management, payment processing, order fulfillment, customer service, and post-purchase matters. For these information technology systems, applications and processes to operate effectively, we or our service providers must maintain and update them. Delays in the maintenance, updates, upgrading or patching of these systems, applications or processes could impair, and on occasion have impaired, their effectiveness or expose us to security risks.Our systems and the third-party systems with which we interact are subject to, and on occasion have experienced, damage or interruption from a number of causes, including power and other critical infrastructure outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, internal or external data theft or misuse, cyberattacks, responsive containment measures by us that may involve voluntarily taking systems off line, natural disasters and catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes or other extreme weather events, public health concerns such as pandemics, military conflicts, acts of war, terrorism or civil unrest, other systems outages, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, and design or usage errors or malfeasance by our employees, contractors or third-party service providers. Although we and our third-party service providers seek to maintain our respective systems effectively and to successfully address the risk of compromise of the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems, these efforts are not always successful. As a result, we or our service providers could experience errors, interruptions, delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure, which could significantly disrupt our operations or impair data security, impact our ability to operate or access communications, financial or banking systems, be costly, time consuming and resource-intensive to remedy and adversely impact our reputation and relationship with customers, suppliers, shareholders or regulators.We are making, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in our information technology systems, infrastructure and personnel, in some cases with the assistance of strategic partners and other third-party service providers. These investments involve replacing existing systems, some of which are older, legacy systems, outsourcing certain technology and business processes to third-party service providers, including the adoption of Generative AI in certain processes, making changes to existing systems including the migration of applications to the cloud, maintaining or enhancing legacy systems, or designing or acquiring new systems. These efforts can result in significant potential risks, including failure of the systems to operate as designed, potential loss or corruption of data, changes in security processes and internal controls, cost overruns, implementation delays or errors and disruption of operations. 11Table of ContentsDisruptions in our customer-facing technology systems could impair our digital retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences.Through our information technology systems, we are able to provide an improved overall shopping experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from a variety of electronic devices and digital platforms. We use our digital platforms as sales channels for our products and services, as methods of providing inspiration and advertising through Macy's Media Network, and as sources of product and other relevant information to our customers to help drive sales. We also have multiple online communities, digital platforms and knowledge centers that allow us to inform, assist and interact with our customers. The retail industry is continually evolving and expanding, with a significant increase in sales initiated online and via mobile applications. We must effectively respond to new developments and changing customer preferences with respect to a digital and interconnected experience. We continually seek to enhance our online and digital properties to provide an attractive, user-friendly interface for our customers. Disruptions, delays, failures or other performance issues with these customer-facing technology systems, or a failure of these systems to meet our or our customers' expectations, could impair the benefits they provide to our business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers and, as a result, our financial performance and results of operations.Information Security, Cybersecurity, Privacy and Data Management RisksA breach of our information technology systems could adversely affect our reputation, business partner and customer relationships and operations, and result in higher costs.Through our sales, marketing activities, and use of third-party information, we collect and store certain non-public personal information that customers provide to purchase products or services, enroll in promotional programs, register on websites, or otherwise communicate to us. This may include phone numbers, driver license numbers, contact preferences, personal information stored on electronic devices, and payment information, including credit and debit card data. We gather and retain information about employees in the normal course of business. We may share sensitive Company data with vendors that assist with certain aspects of our business, such as social media and data analytics firms. In addition, our digital operations depend upon the transmission of confidential information over the internet, such as information permitting cashless payments. We employ safeguards for the protection of this information and have made significant investments to secure access to our information technology network, the importance of which has increased due to many of our colleagues working remotely. For instance, we have implemented authentication protocols, installed firewalls and anti-virus/anti-malware software, established data security breach preparedness and response plans, conduct continuous risk assessments, and mitigate software vulnerability with security patches. We also employ encryption and other methods to protect our data, promote security awareness with our employees and work with business partners in an effort to create secure and compliant systems.Protections we have in place to safeguard this information may be compromised as a result of third-party security breaches, theft, cyberattacks, including the use of malicious codes, worms, phishing, spyware, denial of service attacks and ransomware errors by employees or employees of third-party vendors, or contractors, misappropriation of data by employees, vendors or unaffiliated third-parties, or other irregularities that may result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to Company data.Retail data frequently targeted by cybercriminals includes consumer credit card data, personally identifiable information, including social security numbers, and health care information. For retailers, point of sale and e-commerce websites are often attacked through compromised credentials, including those obtained through phishing, vishing and credential stuffing. Other methods of attack include advanced malware, the exploitation of software and operating vulnerabilities, and physical device tampering/skimming at card reader units. We believe these attack methods will continue to evolve. In addition, the risk of cyber-based attacks is heightened with many of our employees working and accessing our technology infrastructure remotely.Cyber threats are increasing in scope, sophistication and frequency and bad actors are exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access to networks for the purpose of implementing ransomware, which is used to encrypt and steal data both from main and backup systems and causes public-facing business interruptions. Our ability to react, mitigate and restore services from an interruption of our systems and processes is key to avoiding adverse financial impacts resulting from loss of sales, services and the cost of paying a ransom.12Table of ContentsRemote work has also created additional challenges to our ability to protect remote workers, corporate networks and cloud environments. We are identifying, tracking and mitigating advanced phishing, malware and attempted credential compromises daily. These attacks are typically occurring on home networks and migrate to the corporate network. However, despite instituting controls for the protection of information, the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service change frequently and our systems and networks may nevertheless remain vulnerable to threats and attacks. To date, no cybersecurity incident or attack has had a material impact on our business or results of operations. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through fraud, trickery, or other forms of deception to employees, contractors, vendors and temporary staff. During the normal course of business, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience attempts to compromise our information systems. We may be unable to protect the integrity of our systems or company data. An alleged or actual unauthorized access or unauthorized disclosure of non-public personal information could:•materially damage our reputation and brand, negatively affect customer satisfaction and loyalty, expose us to individual claims or consumer class actions, administrative, civil or criminal investigations or actions, and infringe on proprietary information; and•cause us to incur substantial costs, including costs associated with remediation of information technology systems, customer protection costs and incentive payments for the maintenance of business relationships, litigation costs, lost revenues resulting from negative changes in consumer shopping patterns, unauthorized use of proprietary information or the failure to retain or attract customers following an attack. While we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk.Supply Chain and Third-Party RisksOur private brand products subject us to certain increased risks, including regulatory, product liability, intellectual property, supplier relations and reputational risks.As we expand our private brand offerings, we may become subject to increased risks due to our greater role in the design, manufacture, marketing and sale of those products. Risks include greater responsibility to administer and comply with applicable regulatory requirements, increased potential product liability and recall exposure, and increased potential reputational risks related to the responsible sourcing of those products. To effectively execute on our private brand strategy, we must also be able to successfully protect our proprietary rights and navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties. An increase in sales of our private brand products may adversely affect sales of our vendors' products and, in turn, our relationships with certain of our vendors. Any failure to appropriately address these risks could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We depend on vendors and other sources of merchandise, goods and services outside the U.S. Our business has been and could in the future continue to be affected by disruptions in, or other legal, regulatory, political, economic or public health issues associated with, our supply network.We depend on vendors for timely and efficient access to products we sell. We source the majority of our merchandise from manufacturers located outside the U.S., primarily Asia. In the normal course of business, we provide credit enhancement to our vendors to support accounts receivable factoring and financing with third parties. Current economic conditions may adversely impact our vendors and they may be unable to access financing or become insolvent and unable to supply us with products, or we may be required to increase cash collateral levels or provide guarantees to support our vendors' financing arrangements. Any major changes in tax policy, such as the disallowance of tax deductions for imported merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and liquidity.We have experienced delays in merchandise inventory receipts and product delivery due to a shortage of vessels and air freight, port congestion, worker shortage impacting shipping and ports, truck driver shortages, rail congestion at major freight hubs and increased demand for consumer goods. Although these delays have not materially impacted our operations to date, they could potentially have a material adverse impact on future product availability, product mix and sales if the delays escalate. We have also experienced increases in shipping rates from Trans-Pacific ocean carriers due to increases in spot market rates and shortage of shipping capacity from China and other parts of Asia and increases in trucking costs due to truck driver shortages and fuel costs.The procurement of all our goods and services is subject to the effects of price increases, which we may or may not be able to pass through to our customers. Our procurement of goods and services from outside the U.S. is subject to risks associated with political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs, health pandemics, armed conflicts and other factors relating to foreign trade. All of these factors may affect our ability to access suitable merchandise on acceptable terms, are beyond our control and could negatively affect our business and results of operations.13Table of ContentsWe source a significant amount of our private label products from factories in China and, to a lesser extent, from factories in Vietnam, India, Indonesia, Jordan and other countries. Since 2017, the U.S. and China have been engaged in a trade dispute that has involved a number of actions against China including the imposition of tariffs on Chinese imports; sanctions on Chinese military-industrial complex companies; stricter reviews of direct investments in the U.S. by Chinese companies; and detention by U.S. Customs of products made in Xinjiang involving alleged human rights violations, which have or may prompt countersanctions or other retaliatory actions from the Chinese government. In addition, differing policies on China–Taiwan and the Russia–Ukraine war have further strained relations between the countries. These geopolitical, trade and investment tensions have created additional uncertainty and increased risk in doing business in China, including potential supply disruptions and higher costs of our products sourced or imported from China.In recent years, the U.S. has been engaged in extended trade negotiations with China, which has resulted in the implementation of tariffs on a significant number of products manufactured in China and imported into the U.S. While recent tariffs and modifications to trade agreements have not resulted in a material impact on our business, results of operations, and liquidity to date, any additional actions, if ultimately enacted, could negatively impact our ability and the ability of our third-party vendors and suppliers to source products from foreign jurisdictions, which could lead to an increase in the cost of goods and adversely affect the Company's profitability. We continue to evaluate the impact of currently effective tariffs, including potential future retaliatory tariffs, as well as other recent changes in foreign trade policy and the U.S. Administration on our supply chain, costs, sales and profitability, and are working through strategies to mitigate such impact, including reviewing sourcing options and working with our vendors and merchants. At this time, it is unknown how long U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods will remain in effect or whether additional tariffs will be imposed. Depending upon their duration and implementation, as well as our ability to mitigate their impact, these changes in foreign trade policy and any recently enacted, proposed and future tariffs on products imported by us from China could negatively impact our business, results of operations and liquidity if they seriously disrupt the movement of products through our supply chain or increase their cost. If our vendors, or any raw material vendors on which our vendors or our private label business relies, suffer prolonged manufacturing or transportation disruptions due to public health conditions or other unforeseen events, our ability to source product could be adversely impacted which would adversely affect our results of operations.Disruption of global sourcing activities and quality and other concerns over our own brands could negatively impact brand reputation and earnings.Economic and civil unrest in areas of the world where we source products, as well as shipping and dockage issues, could adversely impact the availability or cost of our products, or both. Most of the Company's goods imported to the U.S. arrive from Asia through ports located on the U.S. west coast and are subject to potential disruption due to labor unrest or shortages, security issues or natural disasters affecting any or all of these ports. In addition, in recent years, we have substantially increased the number and types of merchandise that are sold under the Company's proprietary brands. While we have focused on the quality of our proprietary branded products, we rely on third-parties to manufacture these products. Such third-party manufacturers may prove to be unreliable, the quality of our globally sourced products may vary from expectations and standards, the products may not meet applicable regulatory requirements which may require us to recall these products, or the products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third-parties. We face challenges in seeking indemnities from manufacturers of these products, including the uncertainty of recovering on such indemnity and the lack of understanding by manufacturers of U.S. product liability laws in certain foreign jurisdictions.We also face concerns relating to human rights, working conditions and other labor rights, and conditions and environmental impact in factories or countries where merchandise that we sell is produced, as well as concerns about transparent sourcing and supply chains. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with laws and regulations relating to production of merchandise, doing business in foreign countries and importing merchandise, and to screen, train and monitor our private label vendors to confirm safe and ethical treatment of workers in our supply chain, there can be no assurance that our vendors and other third parties with whom we do business will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies, which could subject us to liability and could adversely impact our reputation, results of operations and business.Material disruptions in relationships with third-parties with whom the Company does business could adversely affect its operations.The Company is a party to contracts, transactions and business relationships with various third parties, including suppliers, service providers, lenders and participants in joint ventures, strategic alliances and other commercial relationships. In some cases, we depend upon such third parties to provide products, services, advertising, technology infrastructure, development and support, data analytics, logistics, other goods and services to operate our business in the ordinary course, extensions of credit, credit card accounts and related receivables, and other matters. Furthermore, third-party vendors may sell products directly to consumers in addition to, or in some cases in lieu of, traditional wholesale channels such as independent stores and retail chains. As our business model depends on offering quality and relevant merchandise brands from third-party vendors in addition to our own private label products, any material disruption in our relationship with such vendors, or material disruption in the products or services provided by other third parties, could adversely affect our revenues, expense structure, earnings and operations.14Table of ContentsEconomic, Global, Legal and External RisksThe Company's business is subject to discretionary consumer spending, unfavorable economic and political conditions, and other related risks.Our sales are significantly affected by changes in discretionary spending by consumers. Consumer spending may be affected by many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions, consumer disposable income levels, consumer confidence levels, the availability, cost and level of consumer debt, consumer behaviors towards incurring and paying debt, the cost of basic necessities and other goods, the strength of the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies and the effects of the weather, natural disasters or health pandemics. These factors can have psychological or economic impacts on consumers that affect their discretionary spending habits. Any decline in discretionary spending by consumers could negatively affect our business and results of operations.Unfavorable global, domestic or regional economic or political conditions and other developments and risks could negatively affect our business and results of operations. For example, unfavorable changes related to interest rates, rates of economic growth, fiscal and monetary policies of governments, inflation, deflation, tax rates and policy, unemployment trends, energy prices, and other matters that influence the availability and cost of merchandise, consumer confidence, spending and tourism could negatively affect our business and results of operations. Unstable political conditions, civil unrest, terrorist activities, armed conflicts or events of extreme violence, including any escalation of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, may disrupt commerce and could negatively affect our business and results of operations. We regularly maintain cash balances at third-party financial institutions in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) insurance limit. The FDIC took control and was appointed receiver of Silicon Valley Bank and New York Signature Bank on March 10, 2023 and March 12, 2023, respectively, and JPMorgan Chase Bank assumed all deposits and substantially all assets of First Republic Bank on May 1, 2023. The Company did not have any direct exposure to Silicon Valley Bank, New York Signature Bank or First Republic Bank. However, if other banks and financial institutions enter receivership or become insolvent in the future in response to financial conditions affecting the banking system and financial markets, our ability to access our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, or to draw on our existing lines of credit, may be threatened and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.Our business could be materially adversely affected by extreme weather conditions, natural disasters or regional or global health pandemics.Extreme weather conditions, including those that may be caused by climate change, in the areas in which our stores are located could negatively affect our business and results of operations. For example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales and profitability. Our business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could reduce demand for a portion of our inventory and thereby reduce our sales and profitability. In addition, extreme weather conditions could result in disruption or delay of production and delivery of materials and products in our supply chain and cause staffing shortages in our stores.Natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes, or a combination of these or other factors, could damage or destroy our facilities or make it difficult for customers to travel to our stores, thereby negatively affecting our business and results of operations.The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the retail industry, including our business. Should we experience a regional or global pandemic or other public health crisis, including from a COVID-19 variant, influenza, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, other microorganism, infectious disease or other cause, it could have a significant negative impact on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Litigation, legislation, regulatory developments or non-compliance could adversely affect our business and results of operations.We are subject to various federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations, inquiries and initiatives in connection with both our core business operations and our credit card and other ancillary operations (including the Credit Card Act of 2009 and the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933). Recent and future developments relating to such matters could increase our compliance costs and adversely affect the profitability of our credit card and other operations. Our effective tax rate is impacted by a number of factors, including changes in federal or state tax law, interpretation of existing laws and the ability to defend and support the tax positions taken on historical tax returns. Certain changes in any of these factors could materially impact the Company's effective tax rate and net income. The Inflation Reduction Act was enacted on August 16, 2022 and includes a number of provisions that may impact the Company, including a corporate alternative minimum tax on certain large corporations, incentives to address climate change mitigation and other non-income tax provisions, including an excise tax on the repurchase of our stock. We are assessing these impacts on our consolidated financial statements.15Table of ContentsWe are also subject to anti-bribery, customs, child labor, truth-in-advertising and other laws, including consumer protection regulations and zoning and occupancy ordinances that regulate retailers generally and/or govern the importation, promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of retail stores and warehouse facilities. Although we undertake to monitor changes in these laws, if these laws change without our knowledge, or are violated by importers, designers, manufacturers, distributors or agents, we could experience delays in shipments and receipt of goods or be subject to fines or other penalties under the controlling regulations, any of which could negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition, we are regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Adverse outcomes in current or future litigation could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Changes in applicable environmental regulations, including increased or additional regulations to limit carbon emissions or other greenhouse gases may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations which could affect our profitability.In addition, our business is subject to complex and rapidly evolving laws addressing data privacy and data protection and companies are under increased regulatory scrutiny with respect to these matters. The Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. The interpretation and application of existing laws regarding data privacy and data protection are in flux and many states are considering new regulations in this area. Data privacy laws enacted in California, Virginia, Colorado, Utah, Connecticut, Iowa, Indiana, Tennessee, Montana, Texas, Oregon, New Jersey, Delaware and New Hampshire (as of February 1, 2024) and other applicable U.S. privacy laws or new state or federal laws may limit our ability to collect and use data, require us to modify our data processing practices or result in the possibility of fines, litigation or orders which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The burdens imposed by these and other laws and regulations that may be enacted, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may also require us to incur substantial costs to reach compliance or change the manner in which we use data.Climate Change-Related RisksClimate change, or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.We have identified certain climate change-related risks that may impact our business over the short-, medium- and long-term. The nature of these risks depends on both the physical aspects of climate change as well as legal, regulatory, and market requirements, pressure to reduce our carbon footprint and our ability to understand and respond to rapidly evolving developments. Climate change and related measures could have adverse impacts on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations, including, but not limited to: •Regulatory Risks. Unfavorable global, domestic or regional economic or political conditions and other developments and risks could negatively affect our business and results of operations. For example, energy or carbon policies (both existing and emerging) that apply to our energy suppliers have the ability to impact indirect costs to our operations through shifts in energy prices. Recent and future developments in regional cap-and-trade programs such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), which sets a declining limit on emissions from regulated power plants within the RGGI states, could increase our energy costs and affect the profitability of operations. The RGGI program spans 11 states and includes Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Virginia. In 2020, Macy's, Inc. reported energy data for 217 locations across these states and could experience increases in the cost of energy in these regions as a result of the RGGI program. From 2021 to 2022, Macy's, Inc. experienced a 22% electricity cost increase across its sites located in RGGI states. Current environmental and climate-related regulation, both at the state and federal levels, are monitored as part of our enterprise risk management process. New and emerging regulatory initiatives in the U.S. related to climate change and ESG could adversely affect our business. On March 6, 2024, the SEC adopted a final rule that will require registrants to disclose certain climate-related information in annual reports. The final rule will be effective for certain parts of our annual reports for fiscal 2025 and 2026 and could lead to increased costs and complexities associated with our SEC reporting.•Reputational Risk. Maintaining our Company's reputation and brand image at a high level is critical to our operations and financial results. Reputational risk in relation to climate-related issues encompasses both supply chain issues and our position and progress toward cleaner energy production and consumption. We rely upon a diverse, global network of suppliers and vendors within our supply chain that may expose us to risks from a reputational and brand perspective. We utilize the Sustainable Apparel Coalition's Higg Index, a suite of tools for the standardized measurement of value chain sustainability. Data is collected from multiple tiers in our Macy's private brand apparel and home textile supply chains as part of our continued efforts to identify brand risk and advocate for sustainability improvements, including energy/greenhouse gas efficiency. Macy's private brands supply chain is and will continue to be impacted by climate change related weather events that may cause supply disruptions. We also use the Higg Index to collect data about the likely resiliency of our supply chains and as an engagement tool to strengthen relationships and make continuous improvement.16Table of ContentsWe face increasing pressure to demonstrate our products are environmentally-friendly. Our efforts to mitigate that risk include using materials or processes that are third-party certified for environmentally-friendly attributes like OEKO-TEX® as well as trademarked fibers like TENCEL™ and REPREVE®. Macy's and Bloomingdale's have curated sitelets online to help strengthen Macy's, Inc.'s position of being identified as a responsible retailer, committed to climate-related and broader environmental topics. These mitigation efforts may not be successful.•Technology Risk. We monitor developments in technology associated with climate change to determine the potential risks involved with maintaining a business-as-usual scenario or to evaluate opportunities for technological advancements or innovation. While the adoption of new technology to combat climate change has the potential to be a business opportunity, the resources associated with implementing this technology introduce financial risk to our organization. For example, upfront costs associated with efficiency projects such as LED lighting retrofits could negatively affect our business results if projected returns on investments are not met. Before adopting new technology, we evaluate the immediate costs and balance them with how long it will take to recoup the investment as well as how likely it is for that return to be realized.•Risk Related to Resource Use. There is increasing scrutiny on the use of resources, particularly energy sources and energy use. Pressure from regulators, consumers and other stakeholders to find alternatives and/or energy-efficient solutions to sharply reduce our use of natural resources is escalating. We continue to look for ways to address these issues and continue to explore developing best practices within the industry. Through memberships in industry groups such as the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, we are working to reduce the environmental and social impact of apparel and footwear products around the world. The use of recycled material textiles emits fewer greenhouse gas emissions and conserves water and energy as compared to making virgin fiber. Additionally, we have rolled out a framework to measure the social and environmental performance of more than 500 facilities, benchmarking by facility type to allow comparison of performance against that of peers.Macy's, Inc.'s greatest opportunity for energy reduction continues to be through our lighting. Since 2010, across Macy's and Bloomingdale's store locations, total energy consumption has been reduced by more than 19.7% through LED lighting retrofits.•Extreme Weather Events and Natural Disasters. The risk of extreme weather events is integrated into our climate change–related enterprise risk management assessment. Our business could be affected by extreme weather conditions, regional or global health pandemics or natural disasters. Extreme weather conditions, such as frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms or natural disasters such as wildfire over a prolonged period could make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales and profitability. Natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes could damage or destroy our facilities, thereby negatively affecting our business and results of operations. Our business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions, which could reduce demand for a portion of our inventory and reduce sales and profitability. In addition, extreme weather conditions could result in disruption or delay of production and delivery of materials and products in our supply chain or impact staffing in our stores.Financial RisksInability to access capital markets could adversely affect our business or financial condition.Changes in the credit and capital markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations, may increase the cost of financing or restrict our access to this potential source of future liquidity. A downgrade in the ratings that rating agencies assign to the Company's short- and long-term debt has and may continue to negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase our cost of borrowing. In addition, our asset-based credit facility requires us to maintain a specified fixed charge coverage ratio. Our ability to comply with the ratio may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If our results of operations deteriorate to a point where we are not in compliance with our debt covenants, and we are unable to obtain a waiver, much of our debt would be in default and could become due and payable immediately. Our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full this indebtedness, resulting in a need for an alternate source of funding. We cannot make any assurances that we would be able to obtain such an alternate source of funding on satisfactory terms, if at all, and our inability to do so could cause the holders of our securities to experience a partial or total loss of their investments in the Company.Our level of indebtedness may adversely affect our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants, react to changes in our business or the industry in which we operate, or prevent us from making payments on our indebtedness.As of February 3, 2024, the aggregate principal amount of our total outstanding indebtedness was $2,998 million. Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences for the holders of our debt and equity securities. For example, it could:•make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations;•increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and external conditions;17Table of Contents•impair our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes;•require us to dedicate a material portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;•expose us to the risk of increased interest rates to the extent we make borrowings under our asset-based credit facility, which bears interest at a variable rate;•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;•place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness; and•limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions.Any of these risks could materially impact our ability to fund our operations or limit our ability to expand our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations"
1,M,MACY'S INC,2023-03-24,"    Risk Factors
.In evaluating the Company, the risks described below and the matters described under “Forward-Looking Statements” should be considered carefully. Such risks and matters are numerous and diverse, may be experienced continuously or intermittently, and may vary in intensity and effect. Although the risks are organized by heading, and each risk is described separately, many of the risks are interrelated. Any of such risks and matters, individually or in combination, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as on the attractiveness and value of an investment in the Company’s securities. You should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk has not already materialized. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future.Strategic, Operational and Competitive RisksOur strategic plans and initiatives may not be successful, which could negatively affect our profitability and growth.In 2020, we announced the Polaris strategy, a multi-year plan designed to stabilize profitability and position the Company for sustainable, profitable growth. We continue to refine the components of the Polaris strategy, including a focus on winning with fashion and style, delivering clear value, excelling in digital shopping, enhancing store experience, modernizing supply chain and enabling transformation. Our digitally-led omni-channel strategy is committed to creating a seamless integration between physical stores and digital shopping. We plan to continue our focus on strengthening our omni-channel capabilities with investments in digital shopping experiences, data and analytics, physical stores, technology infrastructure and more efficient fulfillment capabilities. These initiatives have required and will continue to require our management, colleagues, and contractors to make transformational changes in our business operations and to improve productivity. These initiatives are also subject to the ability to attract and retain skilled personnel to support the initiatives. We face challenges in executing our Polaris strategy and initiatives in the current environment of inflation, increased interest rates, economic uncertainty and other macroeconomic conditions that may impact discretionary spending. Our ability to achieve sustainable, profitable growth is subject to the successful implementation of our strategic plans, including the Polaris strategy, and realization of anticipated benefits and savings. If we are unable to successfully execute our strategic plans and initiatives to achieve the intended results or these investments or initiatives do not perform as expected or create implementation or operational challenges, our profitability and growth could suffer.We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs, expectations, or trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with customers, the demand for our products and services, and our market share.The success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to evolving trends in demographics, shifts in consumer preferences, expectations and needs, unexpected weather conditions, public health issues (including pandemics and related shut-downs or other actions by government regulators or others) or natural disasters, while also managing appropriate inventory levels in our stores and distribution or fulfillment centers and maintaining an excellent customer experience. It is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand. As customers expect a more personalized experience, our ability to collect, use and protect relevant customer data is important to our ability to effectively meet their expectations, but is subject to the impact of legislation or regulations governing data privacy, security and other external factors. Customer preferences and expectations related to sustainability of products and operations are also increasing. If we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to meet the individual needs and expectations of or within a customer group, we may lose market share with respect to those customers. Our sales and operating results depend on our ability to manage our inventory and merchandise selection.Our profitability depends on our ability to manage inventory levels and merchandise selection. Overestimating customer demand for merchandise can result in the need to record unplanned and incremental inventory markdowns and sell excess inventory at clearance prices, which would negatively impact our gross margins and operating results. Underestimating customer demand for merchandise can lead to inventory shortages, missed sales opportunities and negative customer experiences.9Table of ContentsThe Company faces significant competition and challenges as consumers continue to migrate to digital shopping channels and depends on its ability to differentiate itself in retail’s ever-changing environment.We conduct our retail merchandising business under highly competitive conditions. Although Macy’s, Inc. is one of the nation’s largest retailers, we have numerous and varied competitors at the national and local levels, including department stores, specialty stores, general merchandise stores, manufacturers’ outlets and websites, off-price and discount stores, online retailers and catalogs, among others. Competition is characterized by many factors, including assortment, advertising, price, quality, service, location, reputation and credit availability. Any failure by us to compete effectively could negatively affect our business and results of operations.As consumers continue to migrate to digital shopping channels, we face pressures to not only compete from a price perspective with our competitors, some of whom sell the same products, but also to differentiate Macy’s, Inc’s. merchandise offerings, services and shopping experiences to stay relevant as a modern department store in retail’s ever-changing environment. We launched Macy’s digital Marketplace in September 2022 featuring a collection of new brands and products from third party sellers to introduce customers to new merchandise options. We continue to significantly invest in our omni-channel capabilities, seeking to improve the profitability of our digital business through delivery expense reduction, gross margin expansion and other initiatives to support digital sales growth. We continue to seek to improve the delivery experience of our customers with strategic investments to fulfill digital sales demand and elevated delivery speed expectations. Insufficient, untimely or misguided investments in these areas could significantly impact our profitability and growth.In addition, a significant decline of customer store traffic or migration of sales from brick-and-mortar stores to digital platforms could lead to additional store closures, restructuring and other costs that could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.Our ability to grow depends in part on our stores remaining relevant to customers.We have invested in facilities and fixtures upgrades, merchandise assortment and customer service in selected stores to improve customer retention rates and overall customer satisfaction. We have opened new off-mall smaller store formats – Market by Macy’s and Bloomie’s – in selected markets to promote customer acquisition, test replacement, expansion or market entry locations, and support our omni-market capabilities. We also introduced permanent Toys “R” Us shops within all Macy’s locations. While these store investments, off-mall store formats, and in-store shops are intended to improve the customer store experience and drive traffic, realization of these benefits may not occur. Because we rely on the ability of our physical retail locations to attract customers, provide full or curated merchandise selections, drive traffic to digital channels and assist in fulfillment, returns and other omni-channel functions, providing a desirable and sought-out shopping experience is important to our financial success. Changes in consumer shopping habits, an over-malled/over-retailed environment, financial difficulties at other anchor tenants, significant mall vacancy issues, mall violence and new on- and off-mall developments could each adversely impact the traffic at current retail locations and lead to a decline in our financial condition or performance.We may not be able to successfully execute our real estate strategy.We continue to explore opportunities to monetize our real estate portfolio, including sales of stores as well as non-store real estate, such as warehouses, outparcels and parking garages. We also continue to evaluate our real estate portfolio to identify opportunities where the redevelopment value of our real estate exceeds the value of non-strategic operating locations. This strategy is multi-pronged and may include transactions, strategic alliances or other arrangements with mall developers or other unrelated third-parties. Where feasible, we may subdivide an existing parcel, continue to operate a store and redevelop any excess parcel for mixed-use, or close the store and redevelop an entire parcel into a mixed-use development, in either event selling the parcel once the site development plan is approved by governmental authorities. Due to the cyclical nature of real estate markets and the risks of real estate development, the performance of our real estate strategy is inherently volatile and could have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition.Our revenues and cash requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of our business.Our business is seasonal, with a high proportion of revenues and operating cash flows generated during the second half of the year, which includes the fall and the months of November and December. A disproportionate amount of our revenues is realized in the fourth quarter due to this seasonality. Should sales during this period fall below our expectations, a disproportionately negative impact on our annual results of operations could occur.10Table of ContentsWe generally incur significant additional expenses in the period leading up to the months of November and December in anticipation of higher sales volume in those periods, including costs for additional inventory, advertising and employees. If we are not successful in executing our sales strategy during this period, we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.We depend on our ability to attract, train, develop and retain quality colleagues.Our business is dependent upon attracting, training, developing and retaining quality employees at all levels of the organization, and management personnel to develop and effectively execute successful business strategies. Macy’s, Inc. has a large number of employees, many of whom are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. Our ability to meet labor needs while controlling costs associated with hiring and training new employees is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation and changing demographics. In recent years, low unemployment, labor shortages, intense competition for talent and a competitive wage environment have impacted our ability to attract, recruit and retain talent. Increases in labor costs and the cost of employee benefits could impact our financial results and cash flow.Minimum wage increases by states and wage and benefit increases to attract and retain workers in a tight labor market have increased labor costs in the retail sector. These increased costs pressure our margins and could have a negative impact on our financial results.Our expenses relating to employee health benefits are significant. Recent medical plan cost increases have been driven by a rise in high-cost claimants, high-cost conditions, high utilization of outpatient facilities, physicians and in-hospital stays, and demographic shifts to an older enrollment population. Unfavorable changes in the cost of employee health benefits could negatively affect our financial results and cash flow. Healthcare costs have risen significantly in recent years, and legislative and private sector initiatives regarding healthcare reform have resulted and could continue to result in significant changes to the U.S. healthcare system. Due to uncertainty regarding legislative or regulatory changes, we are not able to fully determine the impact that future healthcare reform could have on our company-sponsored medical plans.If cash flows from our private label and co-branded credit cards decrease, our financial and operational results may be negatively impacted.In 2005, in connection with the sale of most of the Company’s credit card accounts and related receivable balances to Citibank, N.A. (Citibank), the Company and Citibank entered into a long-term marketing and servicing alliance pursuant to the terms of a Credit Card Program Agreement (Credit Card Program). Subsequent to this initial arrangement and associated amendments, on December 13, 2021, the Company entered into the sixth amendment to the amended and restated Credit Card Program with Citibank (the Program Agreement), pursuant to which Citibank issues, maintains and services Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s private label and co-branded credit cards. Under the Program Agreement, which extends until March 31, 2030, Citibank owns the credit card receivables generated from sales through the credit cards and Macy’s receives fees and shares in profits based on a tiered return on the receivables portfolio net of program expenses. Credit card revenues, net were $863 million, or approximately 3.5% of net sales, for 2022. Deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect the volume of new credit accounts, the amount of credit card program balances and the ability of credit card holders to pay their balances. These conditions could result in the Company receiving lower payments under the credit card program.In addition, recent shifts from sales through our proprietary credit cards to debit products and alternative buy-now-pay-later payment methods may result in increased costs and could have a negative impact to credit card revenues due to potentially reduced credit card receivable balances. Credit card operations are subject to many federal and state laws that may impose certain requirements and limitations on credit card providers. Citibank and our subsidiary bank, FDS Bank, may be required to comply with regulations that may negatively impact the operation of our proprietary credit card. This negative impact may affect our revenue streams derived from the credit cards receivables portfolio and our financial results.In February 2023 the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau proposed to amend Regulation Z to lower the safe harbor dollar amount credit card companies can charge for late fees from up to $41 to $8 for a missed payment. The proposed rule is subject to a notice and comment period. If adopted as proposed the rule would reduce the amount of late fees that can be charged, which could have a negative impact on Macy's Inc. credit card revenues.11Table of ContentsOur defined benefit plan funding requirements or plan settlement expense could impact our financial results and cash flow.Significant changes in interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and timing and amount of benefit payments could affect the funded status of our plans and could increase future funding requirements of the plans. A significant increase in future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.These plans allow eligible retiring employees to receive lump sum distributions of benefits earned. Under applicable accounting rules, if annual lump sum distributions exceed an actuarially determined threshold of the total of the annual service and interest costs, we would be required to recognize in the current period of operations a settlement expense of a portion of the unrecognized actuarial loss, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.If our Company’s reputation and brand image are not maintained at a high level, our operations and financial results may suffer.We believe our reputation and brand image are partially based on the perception that we act equitably and honestly in dealing with our customers, employees, business partners and shareholders. Our reputation and brand image may be deteriorated by any incident that erodes the trust or confidence of our customers or the general public, particularly if the incident results in significant adverse publicity or governmental inquiry. Information about us, whether or not true, may be instantly posted on social media platforms at any time, which could adversely impact our reputation or brand image. The harm could be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. Other brand risks include an active shooter incident at a store or injury or death at a parade or other branded event. If our reputation or brand image is damaged, our customers may refuse to continue shopping with us, potential employees may be unwilling to work for us, business partners may be discouraged from seeking future business dealings with us and, as a result, our business and results of operations may suffer.If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our brands and business could be damaged.We believe that our copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, trade secrets and similar intellectual property are important assets and key elements of our strategy, including those related to our private brand merchandise. We rely on copyright and trademark law, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors and others to protect our proprietary rights. If the steps we take to protect our proprietary rights are inadequate, or if we are unable to protect or preserve the value of our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other proprietary rights for any reason, our merchandise brands and business could be negatively affected.Infrastructure RisksUnforeseen disruptions in our distribution and fulfillment centers could have an adverse impact on our business and operations.Our business depends on the orderly receipt and distribution of merchandise and effective management of our distribution and fulfillment centers. Unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fire, severe weather conditions (including those that may be caused by climate change), natural disasters, health pandemics or other catastrophic events, labor disagreements, or other shipping problems may result in the loss or unavailability of inventory and/or delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores, fulfillment centers and customers.Failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business.We rely extensively on information technology systems and related personnel to collect, analyze, process, store, manage, transmit and protect transactions and data. Some of these systems are managed or provided by third-party service providers, including certain cloud platform providers. In managing our business, we also rely heavily on the integrity and security of, and consistent access to, this operational and financial data for information such as sales, customer data, employee data, demand forecasting, merchandise ordering, inventory replenishment, supply chain management, payment processing, order fulfillment, customer service, and post-purchase matters. For these information technology systems, applications and processes to operate effectively, we or our service providers must maintain and update them. Delays in the maintenance, updates, upgrading or patching of these systems, applications or processes could impair, and on occasion have impaired, their effectiveness or expose us to security risks.12Table of Contents Our systems and the third-party systems with which we interact are subject to, and on occasion have experienced, damage or interruption from a number of causes, including power and other critical infrastructure outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, internal or external data theft or misuse, cyberattacks, responsive containment measures by us that may involve voluntarily taking systems off line, natural disasters and catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes or other extreme weather events, public health concerns such as pandemics, military conflicts, acts of war, terrorism or civil unrest, other systems outages, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, and design or usage errors or malfeasance by our employees, contractors or third-party service providers. Although we and our third-party service providers seek to maintain our respective systems effectively and to successfully address the risk of compromise of the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems, such efforts are not always successful. As a result, we or our service providers could experience errors, interruptions, delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure, which could significantly disrupt our operations or impair data security, impact our ability to operate or access communications, financial or banking systems, be costly, time consuming and resource-intensive to remedy and adversely impact our reputation and relationship with customers, suppliers, shareholders or regulators. We are making, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in our information technology systems, infrastructure and personnel, in some cases with the assistance of strategic partners and other third-party service providers. These investments involve replacing existing systems, some of which are older, legacy systems, outsourcing certain technology and business processes to third-party service providers, making changes to existing systems including the migration of applications to the cloud, maintaining or enhancing legacy systems, or designing or acquiring new systems. These efforts can result in significant potential risks, including failure of the systems to operate as designed, potential loss or corruption of data, changes in security processes and internal controls, cost overruns, implementation delays or errors and disruption of operations. Disruptions in our customer-facing technology systems could impair our digital retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences.Through our information technology systems, we are able to provide an improved overall shopping experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from a variety of electronic devices and digital platforms. We use our digital platforms as sales channels for our products and services, as methods of providing inspiration, and as sources of product and other relevant information to our customers to help drive sales. We also have multiple online communities, digital platforms and knowledge centers that allow us to inform, assist and interact with our customers. The retail industry is continually evolving and expanding, with a significant increase in sales initiated online and via mobile applications. We must effectively respond to new developments and changing customer preferences with respect to a digital and interconnected experience. We continually seek to enhance our online and digital properties to provide an attractive, user-friendly interface for our customers. Disruptions, delays, failures or other performance issues with these customer-facing technology systems, or a failure of these systems to meet our or our customers’ expectations, could impair the benefits they provide to our business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers and, as a result, our financial performance and results of operations.Information Security, Cybersecurity, Privacy and Data Management RisksA breach of our information technology systems could adversely affect our reputation, business partner and customer relationships and operations, and result in higher costs.Through our sales, marketing activities, and use of third-party information, we collect and store certain non-public personal information that customers provide to purchase products or services, enroll in promotional programs, register on websites, or otherwise communicate to us. This may include phone numbers, driver license numbers, contact preferences, personal information stored on electronic devices, and payment information, including credit and debit card data. We gather and retain information about employees in the normal course of business. We may share sensitive company data with vendors that assist with certain aspects of our business, such as social media and data analytics firms. In addition, our digital operations depend upon the transmission of confidential information over the Internet, such as information permitting cashless payments. We employ safeguards for the protection of this information and have made significant investments to secure access to our information technology network, the importance of which has increased due to many of our colleagues working remotely. For instance, we have implemented authentication protocols, installed firewalls and anti-virus/anti-malware software, established data security breach preparedness and response plans, conduct continuous risk assessments, and mitigate software vulnerability with security patches. We also employ encryption and other methods to protect our data, promote security awareness with our employees and work with business partners in an effort to create secure and compliant systems.13Table of ContentsProtections we have in place to safeguard this information may be compromised as a result of third-party security breaches, theft, cyberattacks, including the use of malicious codes, worms, phishing, spyware, denial of service attacks and ransomware errors by employees or employees of third-party vendors, or contractors, misappropriation of data by employees, vendors or unaffiliated third-parties, or other irregularities that may result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to company data.Retail data frequently targeted by cybercriminals includes consumer credit card data, personally identifiable information, including social security numbers, and health care information. For retailers, point of sale and e-commerce websites are often attacked through compromised credentials, including those obtained through phishing, vishing and credential stuffing. Other methods of attack include advanced malware, the exploitation of software and operating vulnerabilities, and physical device tampering/skimming at card reader units. We believe these attack methods will continue to evolve. In addition, the risk of cyber-based attacks is heightened with many of our employees working and accessing our technology infrastructure remotely.Cyber threats are increasing in scope, sophistication and frequency and bad actors are exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access to networks for the purpose of implementing ransomware, which is used to encrypt and steal data both from main and backup systems and causes public-facing business interruptions. Our ability to react, mitigate and restore services from an interruption of our systems and processes is key to avoiding adverse financial impacts resulting from loss of sales, services and the cost of paying a ransom.Remote work has also created additional challenges to our ability to protect remote workers, corporate networks and cloud environments. We are identifying, tracking and mitigating advanced phishing, malware and attempted credential compromises daily. These attacks are typically occurring on home networks and migrate to the corporate network. However, despite instituting controls for the protection of information, the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service change frequently and our systems and networks may nevertheless remain vulnerable to threats and attacks. To date, no cybersecurity incident or attack has had a material impact on our business or results of operations. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through fraud, trickery, or other forms of deception to employees, contractors, vendors and temporary staff. During the normal course of business, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience attempts to compromise our information systems. We may be unable to protect the integrity of our systems or company data. An alleged or actual unauthorized access or unauthorized disclosure of non-public personal information could:•materially damage our reputation and brand, negatively affect customer satisfaction and loyalty, expose us to individual claims or consumer class actions, administrative, civil or criminal investigations or actions, and infringe on proprietary information; and•cause us to incur substantial costs, including costs associated with remediation of information technology systems, customer protection costs and incentive payments for the maintenance of business relationships, litigation costs, lost revenues resulting from negative changes in consumer shopping patterns, unauthorized use of proprietary information or the failure to retain or attract customers following an attack. While we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk.Supply Chain and Third-Party RisksOur private brand products subject us to certain increased risks, including regulatory, product liability, intellectual property, supplier relations and reputational risks.As we expand our private brand offerings, we may become subject to increased risks due to our greater role in the design, manufacture, marketing and sale of those products. Risks include greater responsibility to administer and comply with applicable regulatory requirements, increased potential product liability and recall exposure, and increased potential reputational risks related to the responsible sourcing of those products. To effectively execute on our private brand strategy, we must also be able to successfully protect our proprietary rights and navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties. An increase in sales of our private brand products may adversely affect sales of our vendors’ products and, in turn, our relationships with certain of our vendors. Any failure to appropriately address these risks could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.14Table of ContentsWe depend on vendors and other sources of merchandise, goods and services outside the U.S. Our business has been and could in the future continue to be affected by disruptions in, or other legal, regulatory, political, economic or public health issues associated with, our supply network.We depend on vendors for timely and efficient access to products we sell. We source the majority of our merchandise from manufacturers located outside the U.S., primarily Asia. In the normal course of business, we provide credit enhancement to our vendors to support accounts receivable factoring and financing with third parties. Current economic conditions may adversely impact our vendors and they may be unable to access financing or become insolvent and unable to supply us with products, or we may be required to increase cash collateral levels or provide guarantees to support our vendors’ financing arrangements. Any major changes in tax policy, such as the disallowance of tax deductions for imported merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and liquidity.We have experienced delays in merchandise inventory receipts and product delivery due to a continuing global shortage of vessels and air freight, port congestion, a global worker shortage impacting shipping and ports, truck driver shortages, rail congestion at major freight hubs and increasing demand for consumer goods. Although these delays have not materially impacted our operations to date, they could potentially have a material adverse impact on future product availability, product mix and sales if the delays do not improve. We have also experienced increases in shipping rates from Trans-Pacific ocean carriers due to increases in spot market rates and shortage of shipping capacity from China and other parts of Asia, and increases in trucking costs due to truck driver shortages and fuel costs.The procurement of all our goods and services is subject to the effects of price increases, which we may or may not be able to pass through to our customers. In addition, our procurement of goods and services from outside the U.S. is subject to risks associated with political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs, health pandemics and other factors relating to foreign trade. All of these factors may affect our ability to access suitable merchandise on acceptable terms, are beyond our control and could negatively affect our business, results of operations and liquidity.We source a significant amount of our private label products from factories in China and, to a lesser extent, from factories in Vietnam, India, Indonesia, Jordan and other countries. Since 2017, the U.S. and China have been engaged in a trade dispute that has involved a number of actions against China including the imposition of tariffs on Chinese imports; sanctions on Chinese military-industrial complex companies; stricter reviews of direct investments in the U.S. by Chinese companies; and detention by U.S. Customs of products made in Xinjiang involving alleged human rights violations, which have or may prompt countersanctions or other retaliatory actions from the Chinese government. In addition, differing policies on China–Taiwan and the Russia–Ukraine war have further strained relations between the countries. These geopolitical, trade and investment tensions have created additional uncertainty and increased risk in doing business in China, including potential supply disruptions and higher costs of our products sourced or imported from China.In recent years, the U.S. has been engaged in extended trade negotiations with China, which has resulted in the implementation of tariffs on a significant number of products manufactured in China and imported into the U.S. While recent tariffs and modifications to trade agreements have not resulted in a material impact on our business, results of operations, and liquidity to date, any additional actions, if ultimately enacted, could negatively impact our ability and the ability of our third-party vendors and suppliers to source products from foreign jurisdictions, which could lead to an increase in the cost of goods and adversely affect the Company’s profitability. We continue to evaluate the impact of currently effective tariffs, including potential future retaliatory tariffs, as well as other recent changes in foreign trade policy and the U.S. Administration on our supply chain, costs, sales and profitability, and are working through strategies to mitigate such impact, including reviewing sourcing options and working with our vendors and merchants. At this time, it is unknown how long U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods will remain in effect or whether additional tariffs will be imposed. Depending upon their duration and implementation, as well as our ability to mitigate their impact, these changes in foreign trade policy and any recently enacted, proposed and future tariffs on products imported by us from China could negatively impact our business, results of operations and liquidity if they seriously disrupt the movement of products through our supply chain or increase their cost. In addition, while we may be able to shift our sourcing options, executing such a shift would be time consuming and would be difficult or impracticable for many products and may result in an increase in our manufacturing costs. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, retaliatory tariffs, or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies have the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers, and/or the U.S. economy, which in turn could adversely impact our business and results of operations.15Table of ContentsIf our vendors, or any raw material vendors on which our vendors or our private label business relies, suffer prolonged manufacturing or transportation disruptions due to public health conditions or other unforeseen events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, our ability to source product could be adversely impacted which would adversely affect our results of operations.Disruption of global sourcing activities and quality and other concerns over our own brands could negatively impact brand reputation and earnings.Economic and civil unrest in areas of the world where we source products, as well as shipping and dockage issues, could adversely impact the availability or cost of our products, or both. Most of the Company’s goods imported to the U.S. arrive from Asia through ports located on the U.S. west coast and are subject to potential disruption due to labor unrest or shortages, security issues or natural disasters affecting any or all of these ports. In addition, in recent years, we have substantially increased the number and types of merchandise that are sold under the Company’s proprietary brands. While we have focused on the quality of our proprietary branded products, we rely on third-parties to manufacture these products. Such third-party manufacturers may prove to be unreliable, the quality of our globally sourced products may vary from expectations and standards, the products may not meet applicable regulatory requirements which may require us to recall these products, or the products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third-parties. We face challenges in seeking indemnities from manufacturers of these products, including the uncertainty of recovering on such indemnity and the lack of understanding by manufacturers of U.S. product liability laws in certain foreign jurisdictions.We also face concerns relating to human rights, working conditions and other labor rights, and conditions and environmental impact in factories or countries where merchandise that we sell is produced, as well as concerns about transparent sourcing and supply chains. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with laws and regulations relating to production of merchandise, doing business in foreign countries and importing merchandise, and to screen, train and monitor our private label vendors to confirm safe and ethical treatment of workers in our supply chain, there can be no assurance that our vendors and other third parties with whom we do business will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies, which could subject us to liability and could adversely impact our reputation, results of operations and business.Material disruptions in relationships with third-parties with whom the Company does business could adversely affect its operations.The Company is a party to contracts, transactions and business relationships with various third parties, including suppliers, service providers, lenders and participants in joint ventures, strategic alliances and other commercial relationships. In some cases, we depend upon such third parties to provide products, services, advertising, technology infrastructure, development and support, data analytics, logistics, other goods and services to operate our business in the ordinary course, extensions of credit, credit card accounts and related receivables, and other matters. Furthermore, third-party vendors may sell products directly to consumers in addition to, or in some cases in lieu of, traditional wholesale channels such as independent stores and retail chains. As our business model depends on offering quality and relevant merchandise brands from third-party vendors in addition to our own private label products, any material disruption in our relationship with such vendors, or material disruption in the products or services provided by other third parties, could adversely affect our revenues, expense structure, earnings and operations.Economic, Global, Legal and External RisksThe Company’s business is subject to discretionary consumer spending, unfavorable economic and political conditions, and other related risks.Our sales are significantly affected by changes in discretionary spending by consumers. Consumer spending may be affected by many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions, consumer disposable income levels, consumer confidence levels, the availability, cost and level of consumer debt, consumer behaviors towards incurring and paying debt, the cost of basic necessities and other goods, the strength of the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies and the effects of the weather, natural disasters or health pandemics. These factors can have psychological or economic impacts on consumers that affect their discretionary spending habits. Any decline in discretionary spending by consumers could negatively affect our business and results of operations.Unfavorable global, domestic or regional economic or political conditions and other developments and risks could negatively affect our business and results of operations. For example, unfavorable changes related to interest rates, rates of economic growth, fiscal and monetary policies of governments, inflation, deflation, tax rates and policy, unemployment trends, energy prices, and other matters that influence the availability and cost of merchandise, consumer confidence, spending and tourism could negatively affect our business and results of operations. Unstable political conditions, civil unrest, terrorist activities, armed conflicts or events of extreme violence, including any escalation of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, may disrupt commerce and could negatively affect our business and results of operations. 16Table of ContentsWe regularly maintain cash balances at third-party financial institutions in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) insurance limit. The FDIC took control and was appointed receiver of Silicon Valley Bank and New York Signature Bank on March 10, 2023 and March 12, 2023, respectively. The Company does not have any direct exposure to Silicon Valley Bank or New York Signature Bank. However, if other banks and financial institutions enter receivership or become insolvent in the future in response to financial conditions affecting the banking system and financial markets, our ability to access our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, or to draw on our existing lines of credit, may be threatened and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.Our business could be materially adversely affected by extreme weather conditions, natural disasters or regional or global health pandemics.Extreme weather conditions, including those that may be caused by climate change, in the areas in which our stores are located could negatively affect our business and results of operations. For example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales and profitability. Our business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could reduce demand for a portion of our inventory and thereby reduce our sales and profitability. In addition, extreme weather conditions could result in disruption or delay of production and delivery of materials and products in our supply chain and cause staffing shortages in our stores.Natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes, or a combination of these or other factors, could damage or destroy our facilities or make it difficult for customers to travel to our stores, thereby negatively affecting our business and results of operations.The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the retail industry, including our business. The Company temporarily closed all of its stores and subsequently furloughed the majority of its workforce from March 2020 through the second quarter of 2020 in response to government regulations, causing a temporary material decline in revenue and operating cash flow. The Company implemented safety measures and health and wellness precautions across its stores and facilities which resulted in additional selling, general and administrative expenses.  The Company experienced delays in inventory receipts and disruptions in its supply chain. Liquidity was negatively impacted by the store closures and the Company incurred additional debt to improve its cash position.  Should we experience a regional or global pandemic or other public health crisis, including from a COVID-19 variant, influenza, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, other microorganism, infectious disease or other cause, it could have a significant negative impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Litigation, legislation, regulatory developments or non-compliance could adversely affect our business and results of operations.We are subject to various federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations, inquiries and initiatives in connection with both our core business operations and our credit card and other ancillary operations (including the Credit Card Act of 2009 and the Home Owners’ Loan Act of 1933). Recent and future developments relating to such matters could increase our compliance costs and adversely affect the profitability of our credit card and other operations. Our effective tax rate is impacted by a number of factors, including changes in federal or state tax law, interpretation of existing laws and the ability to defend and support the tax positions taken on historical tax returns. Certain changes in any of these factors could materially impact the Company’s effective tax rate and net income. The Inflation Reduction Act was enacted on August 16, 2022 and includes a number of provisions that may impact the Company, including a corporate alternative minimum tax on certain large corporations, incentives to address climate change mitigation and other non-income tax provisions, including an excise tax on the repurchase of our stock. We are assessing these impacts on our consolidated financial statements.We are also subject to anti-bribery, customs, child labor, truth-in-advertising and other laws, including consumer protection regulations and zoning and occupancy ordinances that regulate retailers generally and/or govern the importation, promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of retail stores and warehouse facilities. Although we undertake to monitor changes in these laws, if these laws change without our knowledge, or are violated by importers, designers, manufacturers, distributors or agents, we could experience delays in shipments and receipt of goods or be subject to fines or other penalties under the controlling regulations, any of which could negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition, we are regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Adverse outcomes in current or future litigation could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Changes in applicable environmental regulations, including increased or additional regulations to limit carbon emissions or other greenhouse gases may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations which could affect our profitability.17Table of ContentsIn addition, our business is subject to complex and rapidly evolving laws addressing data privacy and data protection and companies are under increased regulatory scrutiny with respect to these matters. The Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. The interpretation and application of existing laws regarding data privacy and data protection are in flux and many states are considering new regulations in this area. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), Virginia Consumer Privacy Act, Colorado Privacy Act, Utah Consumer Privacy Act, Connecticut Data Privacy Act and other applicable U.S. privacy laws or new state or federal laws may limit our ability to collect and use data, require us to modify our data processing practices or result in the possibility of fines, litigation or orders which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The burdens imposed by these and other laws and regulations that may be enacted, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may also require us to incur substantial costs to reach compliance or change the manner in which we use data.Our sales and operating results could be adversely affected by product safety concerns.If our merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or consumers' expectations regarding safety, we could experience decreased sales, increased costs and/or be exposed to legal and reputational risk. Events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action and/or private litigation. Reputational damage caused by real or perceived product safety concerns could negatively affect our business and results of operations.Climate Change-Related RisksClimate change, or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.We have identified certain climate change-related risks that may impact our business over the short-, medium- and long-term. The nature of these risks depends on both the physical aspects of climate change as well as legal, regulatory, and market requirements, pressure to reduce our carbon footprint and our ability to understand and respond to rapidly evolving developments. Climate change and related measures could have adverse impacts on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations, including, but not limited to: •Regulatory Risks. Unfavorable global, domestic or regional economic or political conditions and other developments and risks could negatively affect our business and results of operations. For example, energy or carbon policies (both existing and emerging) that apply to our energy suppliers have the ability to impact indirect costs to our operations through shifts in energy prices. Recent and future developments in regional cap-and-trade programs such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), which sets a declining limit on emissions from regulated power plants within the RGGI states, could increase our energy costs and affect the profitability of operations. The RGGI program spans 11 states and includes Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Virginia. In 2020, Macy’s, Inc. reported energy data for 217 locations across these states and could experience increases in the cost of energy in these regions as a result of the RGGI program. From 2021 to 2022, Macy’s, Inc. experienced a 2% electricity cost increase across its sites located in RGGI states. Current environmental and climate-related regulation, both at the state and federal levels, are monitored as part of our enterprise risk management process. •Reputational Risk. Maintaining our Company’s reputation and brand image at a high level is critical to our operations and financial results. Reputational risk in relation to climate-related issues encompasses both supply chain issues and our position and progress toward cleaner energy production and consumption. We rely upon a diverse, global network of suppliers and vendors within our supply chain that may expose us to risks from a reputational and brand perspective. We utilize the Sustainable Apparel Coalition’s Higg Index, a suite of tools for the standardized measurement of value chain sustainability. Data is collected from multiple tiers in our Macy’s Private Brand apparel and home textile supply chains as part of our continued efforts to identify brand risk and advocate for sustainability improvements, including energy/greenhouse gas efficiency. Macy’s Private Brands supply chain is and will continue to be impacted by climate change related weather events that may cause supply disruptions. We also use the Higg Index to collect data about the likely resiliency of our supply chains and as an engagement tool to strengthen relationships and make continuous improvement.18Table of ContentsWe face increasing pressure to demonstrate our products are environmentally-friendly. Our efforts to mitigate that risk include using materials or processes that are third-party certified for environmentally-friendly attributes like OEKO-TEX® as well as trademarked fibers like TENCEL™ and REPREVE®. Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s have curated sitelets online to help strengthen Macy’s, Inc.’s position of being identified as a responsible retailer, committed to climate-related and broader environmental topics. These mitigation efforts may not be successful.•Technology Risk. We monitor developments in technology associated with climate change to determine the potential risks involved with maintaining a business-as-usual scenario or to evaluate opportunities for technological advancements or innovation. While the adoption of new technology to combat climate change has the potential to be a business opportunity, the resources associated with implementing this technology introduce financial risk to our organization. For example, upfront costs associated with efficiency projects such as LED lighting retrofits could negatively affect our business results if projected returns on investments are not met. Before adopting new technology, we evaluate the immediate costs and balance them with how long it will take to recoup the investment as well as how likely it is for that return to be realized.•Risk Related to Resource Use. There is increasing scrutiny on the use of resources, particularly energy sources and energy use. Pressure from regulators, consumers and other stakeholders to find alternatives and/or energy-efficient solutions to sharply reduce our use of natural resources is escalating. We continue to look for ways to address these issues and continue to explore developing best practices within the industry. Through memberships in industry groups such as the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, we are working to reduce the environmental and social impact of apparel and footwear products around the world. The use of recycled material textiles emits fewer greenhouse gas emissions and conserves water and energy as compared to making virgin fiber. Additionally, we have rolled out a framework to measure the social and environmental performance of over 500 facilities, benchmarking by facility type to allow comparison of performance against that of peers.Macy’s, Inc.’s greatest opportunity for energy reduction continues to be through our lighting. Since 2010, across Macy's and Bloomingdale's store locations, total energy consumption has been reduced by more than 18.4% through LED lighting retrofits.•Extreme Weather Events and Natural Disasters. The risk of extreme weather events is integrated into our climate change–related enterprise risk management assessment. Our business could be affected by extreme weather conditions, regional or global health pandemics or natural disasters. Extreme weather conditions, such as frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms or natural disasters such as wildfire over a prolonged period could make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales and profitability. Natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes could damage or destroy our facilities, thereby negatively affecting our business and results of operations. Our business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions, which could reduce demand for a portion of our inventory and reduce sales and profitability. In addition, extreme weather conditions could result in disruption or delay of production and delivery of materials and products in our supply chain or impact staffing in our stores.Financial RisksInability to access capital markets could adversely affect our business or financial condition.Changes in the credit and capital markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations, may increase the cost of financing or restrict our access to this potential source of future liquidity. A downgrade in the ratings that rating agencies assign to the Company’s short- and long-term debt has and may continue to negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase our cost of borrowing. In addition, our asset-based credit facility requires us to maintain a specified fixed charge coverage ratio. Our ability to comply with the ratio may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If our results of operations deteriorate to a point where we are not in compliance with our debt covenants, and we are unable to obtain a waiver, much of our debt would be in default and could become due and payable immediately. Our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full this indebtedness, resulting in a need for an alternate source of funding. We cannot make any assurances that we would be able to obtain such an alternate source of funding on satisfactory terms, if at all, and our inability to do so could cause the holders of our securities to experience a partial or total loss of their investments in the Company.19Table of ContentsOur level of indebtedness may adversely affect our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants, react to changes in our business or the industry in which we operate, or prevent us from making payments on our indebtedness.As of January 28, 2023, the aggregate principal amount of our total outstanding indebtedness was $2,996 million. Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences for the holders of our debt and equity securities. For example, it could:•make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations;•increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and external conditions;•impair our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes;•require us to dedicate a material portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;•expose us to the risk of increased interest rates to the extent we make borrowings under our asset-based credit facility, which bears interest at a variable rate;•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;•place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness; and•limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions.Any of these risks could materially impact our ability to fund our operations or limit our ability to expand our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations"
8,M,MACY'S INC,2020-03-30,"Risk Factors
.In evaluating Macy's, the risks described below and the matters described in “Forward-Looking Statements” should be considered carefully. Such risks and matters are numerous and diverse, may be experienced continuously or intermittently, and may vary in intensity and effect. Any of such risks and matters, individually or in combination, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as on the attractiveness and value of an investment in Macy's securities.The recent outbreak of COVID-19 may have a significant negative impact on the Company's business and financial resultsIn December 2019, there was an outbreak of COVID-19 in China that has since spread to many other regions of the world.  The outbreak was subsequently labeled as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020.  As the pandemic continues to spread throughout the United States, businesses as well as federal, state and local governments have implemented significant actions to attempt to mitigate this public health crisis.  Although the ultimate severity of the COVID-19 outbreak is uncertain at this time, the pandemic may have adverse impacts on the Company's financial condition and results of operations, including, but not limited to:•The Company may experience significant reductions or volatility in demand for its retail products as customers may not be able to purchase merchandise due to illness, quarantine or government or self-imposed restrictions placed on our stores' operations. Currently all of our stores are closed and will remain closed until it is safe to reopen. Additionally, social distancing measures or changes in consumer spending behaviors due to COVID-19 may continue to impact traffic in our stores after they resume normal operations and such actions could result in a loss of sales and profit.•The Company may experience temporary or long-term disruptions in its supply chain, as the outbreak has resulted in travel disruptions and has impacted manufacturing and distribution throughout the world. We anticipate that the receipt of products or raw material sourced from impacted areas will be slowed or disrupted in the coming months and our brand partners are expected to face similar challenges in fulfilling our orders for their merchandise. Furthermore, transportation delays and cost increases, more extensive travel restrictions, closures or disruptions of businesses and facilities or social, economic, political or labor instability in the affected areas, may impact our or our suppliers' operations or our customers.  •The Company may be required to change its plan for inventory receipts which would place financial pressure on our brand partners.  Such actions may negatively impact our relationships with our brand partners or adversely impact their financial performance and position. If this occurs, our current brand partners' ability to meet their obligations to the Company may be impacted or we may also be required to identify new brand partner relationships.•The Company's liquidity may be negatively impacted if its stores do not resume normal operations and the Company may be required to pursue additional sources of financing to meet its financial obligations. Obtaining such financing is not guaranteed and is largely dependent upon market conditions and other factors. Further actions may be required to improve the Company's cash position, including but not limited to, monetizing Company assets, implementing employee furloughs, and foregoing capital expenditures and other discretionary expenses. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on the Company's operations and financial results depends on future developments and is highly uncertain due to the unknown duration and severity of the outbreak.  The situation is changing rapidly and future impacts may materialize that are not yet known.6Strategic, Operational and Competitive RisksOur strategic initiatives may not be successful, which could negatively affect our profitability and growth.In February 2020, we announced the Polaris strategy, a three-year plan designed to stabilize profitability and position the Company for sustainable, profitable growth. Our ability to achieve sustainable, profitable growth is subject to the successful implementation of our strategic plans, including the Polaris strategy, and realization of anticipated benefits and savings.  If these investments or initiatives do not perform as expected or create implementation or operational challenges, we may incur impairment charges and our profitability and growth could suffer.Our sales and operating results depend on consumer preferences and consumer spending.The fashion and retail industries are subject to sudden shifts in consumer trends and consumer spending. Our sales and operating results depend in part on our ability to predict or respond to changes in fashion trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner. We develop new retail concepts and continuously adjust our industry position in certain major and private-label brands and product categories in an effort to attract and retain customers. Any sustained failure to anticipate, identify and respond to emerging trends in lifestyle and consumer preferences could negatively affect our business and results of operations. Our sales are significantly affected by discretionary spending by consumers. Consumer spending may be affected by many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions, consumer disposable income levels, consumer confidence levels, the availability, cost and level of consumer debt, consumer behaviors towards incurring and paying debt, the cost of basic necessities and other goods, the strength of the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies and the effects of the weather, natural disasters or health pandemics. These factors can have psychological or economic impacts on consumers that affect their discretionary spending habits. Any decline in discretionary spending by consumers could negatively affect our business and results of operations.We face significant competition in the retail industry. We conduct our retail merchandising business under highly competitive conditions. Although Macy's is one of the nation’s largest retailers, we have numerous and varied competitors at the national and local levels, including department stores, specialty stores, general merchandise stores, manufacturers’ outlets, off-price and discount stores, online retailers, catalogs and television shopping, among others. Competition is characterized by many factors, including assortment, advertising, price, quality, service, location, reputation and credit availability. Any failure by us to compete effectively could negatively affect our business and results of operations.We face challenges as consumers migrate to online shopping and we depend on our ability to differentiate Macy's in retail's ever-changing environment.As consumers continue to migrate online, we face pressures to not only compete from a price perspective with our competitors, some of whom sell the same products, but also to differentiate Macy's to stay relevant in retail's ever-changing environment.  We continue to significantly invest in our omnichannel capabilities to provide a seamless shopping experience to our customers between our store locations and our online and mobile environments.  Insufficient, untimely or misguided investments in this area could significantly impact our profitability and growth and affect our ability to attract new customers, as well as maintain our existing ones.In addition, declining customer store traffic and migration of sales from brick and mortar stores to digital platforms could lead to additional store closures, restructuring and other costs that could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.Our ability to grow depends in part on our stores remaining relevant to customers.We are investing in facilities and fixtures upgrades, merchandise assortment and customer service in selected stores to improve customer retention rates and overall customer satisfaction. Some stores are receiving targeted local marketing plans to drive customer traffic.  While these stores with the ""Growth Treatment"" have outperformed the remainder of our store fleet, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve continued improvement in our store business.Because we rely on the ability of our physical retail locations to remain relevant to customers, providing desirable and sought-out shopping experiences is critical to our financial success.  Changes in consumer shopping habits, financial difficulties at other anchor tenants, significant mall vacancy issues, mall violence and new on- and off-mall developments could each adversely impact the traffic at current retail locations and lead to a decline in our financial condition or performance.7We may not be able to successfully execute our real estate strategy.We continue to explore opportunities to monetize our real estate portfolio, including sales of stores as well as non-store real estate such as warehouses, outparcels and parking garages. We also continue to evaluate our real estate portfolio to identify opportunities where the redevelopment value of our real estate exceeds the value of non-strategic operating locations.  This strategy is multi-pronged and may include transactions, strategic alliances or other arrangements with mall developers or other unrelated third-parties.  Due to the cyclical nature of real estate markets, the performance of our real estate strategy is inherently volatile and could have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition.Our revenues and cash requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of our business.Our business is seasonal, with a high proportion of revenues and operating cash flows generated during the second half of the year, which includes the fall and holiday selling seasons. A disproportionate amount of our revenues is in the fourth quarter, which coincides with the holiday season. Should holiday sales fall below our expectations, a disproportionately negative impact on our results of operations could occur.We incur significant additional expenses in the period leading up to the months of November and December in anticipation of higher sales volume in those periods, including costs for additional inventory, advertising and employees. If we are not successful in selling inventory, we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. We depend on our ability to attract, train, develop and retain quality employees.Our business is dependent upon attracting, training, developing and retaining quality employees. Macy's has a large number of employees, many of whom are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. The ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs associated with hiring and training new employees is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation and changing demographics. In addition, as a large and complex enterprise operating in a highly competitive and challenging business environment, Macy's is highly dependent upon management personnel to develop and effectively execute successful business strategies and tactics.  Any circumstances that adversely impact our ability to attract, train, develop and retain quality employees throughout the organization could negatively affect our business and results of operations.We depend on the success of advertising and marketing programs.Our business depends on effective marketing to create high customer traffic at stores and online. Macy's has many initiatives in this area, and we often change advertising and marketing programs to attract customers and increase sales. There can be no assurance as to our continued ability to effectively execute our advertising and marketing programs, and any failure to do so could negatively affect our business and results of operations.If cash flows from our private label credit card decrease, our financial and operational results may be negatively impacted.We previously sold most of our credit accounts and related receivables to Citibank.  Following the sale, we share in the economic performance of the credit card program with Citibank. Deterioration in economic or political conditions could adversely affect the volume of new credit accounts, the amount of credit card program balances and the ability of credit card holders to pay their balances. These conditions could result in Macy’s receiving lower payments under the credit card program.Credit card operations are subject to many federal and state laws that may impose certain requirements and limitations on credit card providers. Citibank and our subsidiary bank, FDS Bank, may be required to comply with regulations that may negatively impact the operation of our private label credit card. This negative impact may affect our revenue streams derived from the sale of such credit card accounts and our financial results.Gross margins could suffer if we are unable to effectively manage our inventory.Our profitability depends on our ability to manage inventory levels and respond to shifts in consumer demand patterns. Overestimating customer demand for merchandise will likely result in the need to record inventory markdowns and sell excess inventory at clearance prices which would negatively impact our gross margins and operating results.  Underestimating customer demand for merchandise can lead to inventory shortages, missed sales opportunities and negative customer experiences.Our defined benefit plan funding requirements or plan settlement expense could impact our financial results and cash flow.Significant changes in interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and timing and amount of benefit payments could affect the funded status of our plans and could increase future funding requirements of the plans. A 8significant increase in future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.These plans allow eligible retiring employees to receive lump sum distributions of benefits earned.  Under applicable accounting rules, if annual lump sum distributions exceed an actuarially determined threshold of the total of the annual service and interest costs, we would be required to recognize in the current period of operations a settlement expense of a portion of the unrecognized actuarial loss and could have a negative impact on our results of operations.Increases in labor costs and the cost of employee benefits could impact our financial results and cash flow.Minimum wage increases by states and wage and benefit increases to attract and retain workers in a tight labor market have driven-up labor costs in the retail sector.  These increased costs pressure our margins and could have a negative impact on our financial results.Our expenses relating to employee health benefits are significant. Unfavorable changes in the cost of such benefits could negatively affect our financial results and cash flow. Healthcare costs have risen significantly in recent years, and recent legislative and private sector initiatives regarding healthcare reform have resulted and could continue to result in significant changes to the U.S. healthcare system. Due to uncertainty regarding legislative or regulatory changes, we are not able to fully determine the impact that future healthcare reform will have on our company-sponsored medical plans.If our company’s reputation and brand are not maintained at a high level, our operations and financial results may suffer.We believe our reputation and brand are partially based on the perception that we act equitably and honestly in dealing with our customers, employees, business partners and shareholders. Our reputation and brand may be deteriorated by any incident that erodes the trust or confidence of our customers or the general public, particularly if the incident results in significant adverse publicity or governmental inquiry. In addition, information concerning us, whether or not true, may be instantly and easily posted on social media platforms at any time, which information may be adverse to our reputation or brand. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction.  If our reputation or brand is damaged, our customers may refuse to continue shopping with us, potential employees may be unwilling to work for us, business partners may be discouraged from seeking future business dealings with us and, as a result, our operations and financial results may suffer.If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our brands and business could be damaged.We believe that our copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, trade secrets and similar intellectual property are important assets and key elements of our strategy, including those related to our private brand merchandise. We rely on copyright and trademark law, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors and others to protect our proprietary rights.  If the steps we take to protect our proprietary rights are inadequate, or if we are unable to protect or preserve the value of our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other proprietary rights for any reason, our merchandise brands and business could be negatively affected.Our sales and operating results could be adversely affected by product safety concerns.If Macy's merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or consumers' expectations regarding safety, we could experience decreased sales, increased costs and/or be exposed to legal and reputational risk. Events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose Macy's to government enforcement action and/or private litigation. Reputational damage caused by real or perceived product safety concerns could negatively affect our business and results of operations.A shutdown or disruption in our distribution and fulfillment centers could have an adverse impact on our business and operations.Our business depends on the orderly receipt and distribution of merchandise and effective management of our distribution and fulfillment centers.  Unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fire, severe weather conditions, natural disasters, health pandemics or other catastrophic events, labor disagreements, or other shipping problems may result in the loss or unavailability of inventory and/or delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores and customers.Technology and Data Security RisksA material disruption in our information technology systems could adversely affect our business or results of operations.We rely extensively on our information technology systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Our information technology systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and 9telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber-attack or other security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, acts of war or terrorism, and usage errors by our employees. If our information technology systems are damaged or cease to function properly, including a material disruption in our ability to authorize and process transactions at our stores or on our online systems, we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them, and we may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our operations. Any material interruption in our information technology systems could negatively affect our business and results of operations.In addition, COVID-19 may have an adverse impact on our information technology systems, including telecommuting issues associated with our employee population working remotely or an increase in online orders due to disruptions or closures of our retail store operations. If our technology-based e-commerce systems do not function properly, our operating results could be negatively affected.Customers are increasingly using computers, tablets and smart phones to shop online and to do price and comparison shopping.  We strive to anticipate and meet our customers’ changing expectations and are focused on building a seamless shopping experience across our omnichannel business.  Any failure to provide user-friendly, secure e-commerce platforms that offer a variety of merchandise at competitive prices with low cost and quick delivery options that meet customers’ expectations could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of e-commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers and have a material adverse impact on the growth of our business and our operating results.A breach of information technology systems could adversely affect our reputation, business partner and customer relationships and operations, and result in high costs.Through our sales, marketing activities, and use of third-party information, we collect and store certain non-public personal information that customers provide to purchase products or services, enroll in promotional programs, register on websites, or otherwise communicate to us. This may include phone numbers, driver license numbers, contact preferences, personal information stored on electronic devices, and payment information, including credit and debit card data. We gather and retain information about employees in the normal course of business. We may share information about such persons with vendors that assist with certain aspects of our business. In addition, our online operations depend upon the transmission of confidential information over the Internet, such as information permitting cashless payments.    We employ safeguards for the protection of this information and have made significant investments to secure access to our information technology network.  For instance, we have implemented authentication protocols, installed firewalls and anti-virus/anti-malware software, conducted continuous risk assessments, and established data security breach preparedness and response plans.  We also employ encryption and other methods to protect our data, promote security awareness with our associates and work with business partners in an effort to create secure and compliant systems.     However, these protections may be compromised as a result of third-party security breaches, burglaries, cyberattacks, errors by employees or employees of third-party vendors, or contractors, misappropriation of data by employees, vendors or unaffiliated third-parties, or other irregularities that may result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to company data. Retail data frequently targeted by cybercriminals includes consumer credit card data, personally identifiable information, including social security numbers, and health care information.  For retailers, point of sale and e-commerce websites are often attacked through compromised credentials, including those obtained through phishing, vishing and credential stuffing. Other methods of attack include advanced malware, the exploitation of software and operating vulnerabilities, and physical device tampering/skimming at card reader units. We believe these attack methods will continue to evolve.  Despite instituting controls for the protection of such information, no commercial or government entity can be entirely free of vulnerability to attack or compromise given that the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service change frequently. During the normal course of business, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience attempts to compromise our information systems. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through fraud, trickery, or other forms of deception to employees, contractors, vendors and temporary staff.  We may be unable to protect the integrity of our systems or company data. An alleged or actual unauthorized access or unauthorized disclosure of non-public personal information could:•materially damage our reputation and brand, negatively affect customer satisfaction and loyalty, expose us to individual claims or consumer class actions, administrative, civil or criminal investigations or actions, and infringe on proprietary information; and10•cause us to incur substantial costs, including costs associated with remediation of information technology systems, customer protection costs and incentive payments for the maintenance of business relationships, litigation costs, lost revenues resulting from negative changes in consumer shopping patterns, unauthorized use of proprietary information or the failure to retain or attract customers following an attack. While we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk.Supply Chain and Third Party RisksWe depend upon vendors and other sources of merchandise, goods and services outside the U.S.. Our business could be affected by disruptions in, or other legal, regulatory, political, economic or public health issues associated with, our supply network.We depend on vendors for timely and efficient access to products we sell. We source the majority of our merchandise from manufacturers located outside the U.S., primarily Asia.  Any major changes in tax policy, such as the disallowance of tax deductions for imported merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and liquidity. The procurement of all our goods and services is subject to the effects of price increases, which we may or may not be able to pass through to our customers. In addition, our procurement of goods and services from outside the U.S. is subject to risks associated with political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs, health pandemics and other factors relating to foreign trade. All of these factors may affect our ability to access suitable merchandise on acceptable terms, are beyond our control and could negatively affect our business, results of operations and liquidity.The U.S. has been engaged in extended trade negotiations with China, which has resulted in the implementation of tariffs on a significant number of products manufactured in China and imported into the U.S.  On May 10, 2019, the current U.S. Administration imposed a 25% tariff on approximately $200 billion worth of imports from China into the U.S. (the “Stage 3 Tariffs”), which imports include merchandise for both private-label and national brands sold in our stores.  On August 1, 2019, the current U.S. Administration announced its intent to impose a 10% tariff on all remaining imports from China, valued at approximately $300 billion (the “Stage 4 Tariffs”), which imports also include merchandise sold in our stores.  The proposed Stage 4 Tariffs were increased to 15% in August 2019 following retaliatory tariffs from China, and a portion of such 15% tariffs went into effect on September 1, 2019 (the “Stage 4A Tariffs”).  Subsequently, in October 2019, the current U.S. Administration announced the suspension of the remaining new 15% tariffs (the “Stage 4B Tariffs”) following positive negotiations with China.  On January 15, 2020, the U.S. and China signed an agreement known as the “Phase One” trade deal, pursuant to which, among other things, the Stage 3 Tariffs remained unchanged, the Stage 4A Tariffs were reduced from 15% to 7.5%, and the Stage 4B Tariffs were indefinitely suspended. We continue to evaluate the impact of the effective tariffs, including potential future retaliatory tariffs, as well as other recent changes in foreign trade policy on our supply chain, costs, sales and profitability, and are actively working through strategies to mitigate such impact, including reviewing sourcing options and working with our vendors and merchants. At this time, it is unknown how long U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods will remain in effect or whether additional tariffs will be imposed. Depending upon their duration and implementation, as well as our ability to mitigate their impact, these changes in foreign trade policy and any recently enacted, proposed and future tariffs on products imported by us from China could negatively impact our business, results of operations and liquidity if they seriously disrupt the movement of products through our supply chain or increase their cost. In addition, while we may be able to shift our sourcing options, executing such a shift would be time consuming and would be difficult or impracticable for many products and may result in an increase in our manufacturing costs. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, retaliatory tariffs, or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers, and/or the U.S. economy, which in turn could adversely impact our results of operations and business.If our vendors, or any raw material vendors on which our vendors or our private label business relies, suffer prolonged manufacturing or transportation disruptions due to public health conditions or other unforeseen events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, our ability to source product could be adversely impacted which would adversely affect our results of operations.  11Disruption of global sourcing activities and quality and other concerns over our own brands could negatively impact brand reputation and earnings.Economic and civil unrest in areas of the world where we source products, as well as shipping and dockage issues, could adversely impact the availability or cost of our products, or both.  Most of Macy’s goods imported to the U.S. arrive from Asia through ports located on the U.S. west coast and are subject to potential disruption due to labor unrest, security issues or natural disasters affecting any or all of these ports.  In addition, in recent years, we have substantially increased the number and types of merchandise that are sold under Macy’s proprietary brands.  While we have focused on the quality of our proprietary branded products, we rely on third-parties to manufacture these products.  Such third-party manufacturers may prove to be unreliable, the quality of our globally sourced products may vary from expectations and standards, the products may not meet applicable regulatory requirements which may require us to recall these products, or the products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third-parties.  We face challenges in seeking indemnities from manufacturers of these products, including the uncertainty of recovering on such indemnity and the lack of understanding by manufacturers of U.S. product liability laws in certain foreign jurisdictions.We also face concerns relating to human rights, working conditions and other labor rights and conditions and environmental impact in factories or countries where merchandise that we sell is produced and concerns about transparent sourcing and supply chains.  We require all vendors for both private and national brands to comply with our vendor and supplier code of conduct which outlines minimum standards to help ensure our merchandise is produced in workplaces free of abusive, exploitative or unsafe working conditions, and to comply with applicable laws and regulations of the United States and the country of manufacture or exportation.  Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with laws and regulations relating to production of merchandise, doing business in foreign countries and importing merchandise, and to screen, train and monitor our private label vendors to ensure safe and ethical treatment of workers in our supply chain, there can be no assurance that our vendors and other third parties with whom we do business will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies, which could subject us to liability and could adversely impact our reputation, results of operations and business. Parties with whom Macy's does business may be subject to insolvency risks or may otherwise become unable or unwilling to perform on their obligations to us.Macy's is a party to contracts, transactions and business relationships with various third parties, including, without limitation, vendors, suppliers, service providers, lenders and participants in joint ventures, strategic alliances and other joint commercial relationships, pursuant to which such third parties have performance, payment and other obligations to Macy's. In some cases, we depend upon such third parties to provide essential leaseholds, products, services or other benefits, including with respect to store and distribution center locations, merchandise, advertising, software development and support, logistics, other agreements for goods and services to operate our business in the ordinary course, extensions of credit, credit card accounts and related receivables, and other vital matters. Current economic, industry and market conditions could result in increased risks to Macy's associated with the potential financial distress or insolvency of such third parties. If any of these third parties were to become subject to bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, the rights and benefits with respect to our contracts, transactions and business relationships with such third parties could be terminated, modified in a manner adverse to us, or otherwise impaired. We may be unable to arrange for alternate or replacement contracts, transactions or business relationships on terms as favorable as existing contracts, transactions or business relationships. Our inability to do so could negatively affect our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.Global, Legal and External RisksMacy’s business is subject to unfavorable economic and political conditions, extreme violence and other related risks.Unfavorable global, domestic or regional economic or political conditions and other developments and risks could negatively affect our business and results of operations. For example, unfavorable changes related to interest rates, rates of economic growth, fiscal and monetary policies of governments, inflation, deflation, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, consumer debt payment behaviors, tax rates and policy, unemployment trends, energy prices, and other matters that influence the availability and cost of merchandise, consumer confidence, spending and tourism could negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition, unstable political conditions, civil unrest, terrorist activities, armed conflicts or events of extreme violence may disrupt commerce and could negatively affect our business and results of operations.12Our business could be affected by extreme weather conditions, natural disasters or regional or global health pandemics.Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located could negatively affect our business and results of operations. For example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales and profitability. Our business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could reduce demand for a portion of our inventory and thereby reduce our sales and profitability. In addition, extreme weather conditions could result in disruption or delay of production and delivery of materials and products in our supply chain and cause staffing shortages in our stores.Natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes, or a combination of these or other factors, could damage or destroy our facilities or make it difficult for customers to travel to our stores, thereby negatively affecting our business and results of operations.Our business and results of operations could also be negatively affected if a regional or global health pandemic were to occur, depending upon its location, duration and severity. Customers might avoid public places, such as our stores, or in extreme cases governments might limit or ban public gatherings or travel, resulting in temporary store closures or changes in consumer spending behavior. A regional or global health pandemic might also result in disruption or delay of production and delivery of materials and products in our supply chain and cause staffing shortages in our stores. Litigation, legislation or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business and results of operations.We are subject to various federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations, inquiries and initiatives in connection with both our core business operations and our credit card and other ancillary operations (including the Credit Card Act of 2009 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010). Recent and future developments relating to such matters could increase our compliance costs and adversely affect the profitability of our credit card and other operations. Our effective tax rate is impacted by a number of factors, including changes in federal or state tax law, interpretation of existing laws and the ability to defend and support the tax positions taken on historical tax returns.  Certain changes in any of these factors could materially impact the effective tax rate and net income. We are also subject to anti-bribery, customs, child labor, truth-in-advertising and other laws, including consumer protection regulations and zoning and occupancy ordinances that regulate retailers generally and/or govern the importation, promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of retail stores and warehouse facilities. Although we undertake to monitor changes in these laws, if these laws change without our knowledge, or are violated by importers, designers, manufacturers, distributors or agents, we could experience delays in shipments and receipt of goods or be subject to fines or other penalties under the controlling regulations, any of which could negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition, we are regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Adverse outcomes in current or future litigation could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Financial RisksInability to access capital markets could adversely affect our business or financial condition.Changes in the credit and capital markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations, may increase the cost of financing or restrict our access to this potential source of future liquidity. A decrease in the ratings that rating agencies assign to Macy’s short and long-term debt may negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase our cost of borrowing. In addition, our bank credit agreements require us to maintain specified interest coverage and leverage ratios. Our ability to comply with the ratios may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If our results of operations or operating ratios deteriorate to a point where we are not in compliance with our debt covenants, and we are unable to obtain a waiver, much of our debt would be in default and could become due and payable immediately. Our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full this indebtedness, resulting in a need for an alternate source of funding. We cannot make any assurances that we would be able to obtain such an alternate source of funding on satisfactory terms, if at all, and our inability to do so could cause the holders of our securities to experience a partial or total loss of their investments in Macy's.Factors beyond our control could affect Macy's stock price.Macy’s stock price, like that of other retail companies, is subject to significant volatility because of many factors, including factors beyond our control. These factors may include:13•general economic, stock, credit and real estate market conditions;•risks relating to Macy’s business and industry, including those discussed above;•strategic actions by us or our competitors;•adverse business announcements by our competitors;•variations in our quarterly results of operations;•future sales or purchases of Macy’s common stock; and•investor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with Macy’s common stock relative to other investment alternatives.We may fail to meet the expectations of our stockholders or of analysts at some time in the future. If the analysts who regularly follow Macy’s stock lower their rating or lower their projections for future growth and financial performance, Macy’s stock price could decline. Also, sales of a substantial number of shares of Macy’s common stock in the public market or the appearance that these shares are available for sale could adversely affect the market price of Macy’s common stock"
10,M,MACY'S INC,2019-04-03,"Risk Factors
.In evaluating Macy's, the risks described below and the matters described in “Forward-Looking Statements” should be considered carefully. Such risks and matters are numerous and diverse, may be experienced continuously or intermittently, and may vary in intensity and effect. Any of such risks and matters, individually or in combination, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as on the attractiveness and value of an investment in Macy's securities.Strategic, Operational and Competitive RisksOur strategic initiatives may not be successful, which could negatively affect our profitability and growth.We are pursuing strategic initiatives to achieve our objective of accelerating profitable growth in our stores and our digital operations. This includes the adoption of new technologies, merchandising strategies and customer service initiatives all designed to improve the shopping experience.  Our ability to achieve profitable growth is subject to the successful implementation of our strategic plans.  If these investments or initiatives do not perform as expected or create implementation or operational difficulties, we may incur impairment charges and our profitability and growth could suffer.Our sales and operating results depend on consumer preferences and consumer spending.The fashion and retail industries are subject to sudden shifts in consumer trends and consumer spending. Our sales and operating results depend in part on our ability to predict or respond to changes in fashion trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner. We develop new retail concepts and continuously adjust our industry position in certain major and private-label brands and product categories in an effort to attract and retain customers. Any sustained failure to anticipate, identify and respond to emerging trends in lifestyle and consumer preferences could negatively affect our business and results of operations. Our sales are significantly affected by discretionary spending by consumers. Consumer spending may be affected by many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions, consumer disposable income levels, consumer confidence levels, the availability, cost and level of consumer debt, consumer behaviors towards incurring and paying debt, the cost of basic necessities and other goods, the strength of the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies and the effects of the weather or natural disasters. These factors can have psychological or economic impacts on consumers that affect their discretionary spending habits. Any decline in discretionary spending by consumers could negatively affect our business and results of operations.We face significant competition in the retail industry. We conduct our retail merchandising business under highly competitive conditions. Although Macy's is one of the nation’s largest retailers, we have numerous and varied competitors at the national and local levels, including department stores, specialty stores, general merchandise stores, manufacturers’ outlets, off-price and discount stores, online retailers, catalogs and television shopping, among others. Competition is characterized by many factors, including assortment, advertising, price, quality, service, location, reputation and credit availability. Any failure by us to compete effectively could negatively affect our business and results of operations.We face challenges as consumers migrate to online shopping and we depend on our ability to differentiate Macy's in retail's ever-changing environment.As consumers continue to migrate online, we face pressures to not only compete from a price perspective with our competitors, some of whom sell the same products, but also to differentiate Macy's to stay relevant in retail's ever-changing environment.  We continue to significantly invest in our omnichannel capabilities to provide a seamless shopping experience to our customers between our brick and mortar locations and our online and mobile environments.  Insufficient, untimely or misguided investments in this area could significantly impact our profitability and growth and affect our ability to attract new customers, as well as maintain our existing ones.In addition, declining customer store traffic and migration of sales from brick and mortar stores to digital platforms could lead to store closures, restructuring and other costs that could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.Our ability to grow depends in part on our brick and mortar stores remaining relevant to customers.We are investing in facilities and fixtures upgrades, merchandise assortment and customer service in selected stores to improve customer retention rates and overall customer satisfaction. Some stores are receiving targeted local marketing plans to drive customer traffic.  While these “Growth” stores have outperformed the remainder of our store fleet, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve continued improvement in our brick and mortar business.6Because we rely on the ability of our physical retail locations to remain relevant to customers, providing desirable and sought-out shopping experiences is critical to our financial success.  Changes in consumer shopping habits, financial difficulties at other anchor tenants, significant mall vacancy issues, mall violence and new mall developments could each adversely impact the traffic at current retail locations and lead to a decline in our financial condition or performance.We may not be able to successfully execute our real estate strategy.We continue to explore opportunities to monetize our real estate portfolio, including sales of stores as well as non-store real estate such as warehouses, outparcels and parking garages. We also continue to evaluate our real estate portfolio to identify opportunities where the redevelopment value of our real estate exceeds the value of non-strategic operating locations.  This strategy is multi-pronged and may include transactions, strategic alliances or other arrangements with mall developers or other unrelated third-parties.  Due to the cyclical nature of real estate markets, the performance of our real estate strategy is inherently volatile and could have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition.Our revenues and cash requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of our business.Our business is seasonal, with a high proportion of revenues and operating cash flows generated during the second half of the year, which includes the fall and holiday selling seasons. A disproportionate amount of our revenues is in the fourth quarter, which coincides with the holiday season. Should holiday sales fall below our expectations, a disproportionately negative impact on our results of operations could occur.We incur significant additional expenses in the period leading up to the months of November and December in anticipation of higher sales volume in those periods, including costs for additional inventory, advertising and employees. If we are not successful in selling inventory, we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. We depend on our ability to attract, train, develop and retain quality employees.Our business is dependent upon attracting, training, developing and retaining quality employees. Macy's has a large number of employees, many of whom are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. The ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs associated with hiring and training new employees is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation and changing demographics. In addition, as a large and complex enterprise operating in a highly competitive and challenging business environment, Macy's is highly dependent upon management personnel to develop and effectively execute successful business strategies and tactics.  Any circumstances that adversely impact our ability to attract, train, develop and retain quality employees throughout the organization could negatively affect our business and results of operations.We depend on the success of advertising and marketing programs.Our business depends on effective marketing to create high customer traffic at stores and online. Macy's has many initiatives in this area, and we often change advertising and marketing programs to attract customers and increase sales. There can be no assurance as to our continued ability to effectively execute our advertising and marketing programs, and any failure to do so could negatively affect our business and results of operations.If cash flows from our private label credit card decrease, our financial and operational results may be negatively impacted.We previously sold most of our credit accounts and related receivables to Citibank.  Following the sale, we share in the economic performance of the credit card program with Citibank. Deterioration in economic or political conditions could adversely affect the volume of new credit accounts, the amount of credit card program balances and the ability of credit card holders to pay their balances. These conditions could result in Macy’s receiving lower payments under the credit card program.Credit card operations are subject to many federal and state laws that may impose certain requirements and limitations on credit card providers. Citibank and our subsidiary bank, FDS Bank, may be required to comply with regulations that may negatively impact the operation of our private label credit card. This negative impact may affect our revenue streams derived from the sale of such credit card accounts and our financial results.Gross margins could suffer if we are unable to effectively manage our inventory.Our profitability depends on our ability to manage inventory levels and respond to shifts in consumer demand patterns. Overestimating customer demand for merchandise will likely result in the need to record inventory markdowns and sell excess inventory at clearance prices which would negatively impact our gross margins and operating results.  Underestimating customer demand for merchandise can lead to inventory shortages, missed sales opportunities and negative customer experiences.7Our defined benefit plan funding requirements or plan settlement expense could impact our financial results and cash flow.Significant changes in interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and timing and amount of benefit payments could affect the funded status of our plans and could increase future funding requirements of the plans. A significant increase in future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.These plans allow eligible retiring employees to receive lump sum distributions of benefits earned.  Under applicable accounting rules, if annual lump sum distributions exceed an actuarially determined threshold of the total of the annual service and interest costs, we would be required to recognize in the current period of operations a settlement expense of a portion of the unrecognized actuarial loss and could have a negative impact on our results of operations.Increases in the cost of employee benefits could impact our financial results and cash flow.Our expenses relating to employee health benefits are significant. Unfavorable changes in the cost of such benefits could negatively affect our financial results and cash flow. Healthcare costs have risen significantly in recent years, and recent legislative and private sector initiatives regarding healthcare reform have resulted and could continue to result in significant changes to the U.S. healthcare system. Due to uncertainty regarding legislative or regulatory changes, we are not able to fully determine the impact that future healthcare reform will have on our company-sponsored medical plans.If our company’s reputation and brand are not maintained at a high level, our operations and financial results may suffer.We believe our reputation and brand are partially based on the perception that we act equitably and honestly in dealing with our customers, employees, business partners and shareholders. Our reputation and brand may be deteriorated by any incident that erodes the trust or confidence of our customers or the general public, particularly if the incident results in significant adverse publicity or governmental inquiry. In addition, information concerning us, whether or not true, may be instantly and easily posted on social media platforms at any time, which information may be adverse to our reputation or brand. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction.  If our reputation or brand is damaged, our customers may refuse to continue shopping with us, potential employees may be unwilling to work for us, business partners may be discouraged from seeking future business dealings with us and, as a result, our operations and financial results may suffer.If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our brands and business could be damaged.We believe that our copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, trade secrets and similar intellectual property are important assets and key elements of our strategy, including those related to our private brand merchandise. We rely on copyright and trademark law, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors and others to protect our proprietary rights.  If the steps we take to protect our proprietary rights are inadequate, or if we are unable to protect or preserve the value of our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other proprietary rights for any reason, our merchandise brands and business could be negatively affected.Our sales and operating results could be adversely affected by product safety concerns.If Macy's merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or consumers' expectations regarding safety, we could experience decreased sales, increased costs and/or be exposed to legal and reputational risk. Events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose Macy's to government enforcement action and/or private litigation. Reputational damage caused by real or perceived product safety concerns could negatively affect our business and results of operations.A shutdown or disruption in our distribution and fulfillment centers could have an adverse impact on our business and operations.Our business depends on the orderly receipt and distribution of merchandise and effective management of our distribution and fulfillment centers.  Unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fire, severe weather conditions, natural disasters or other catastrophic events, labor disagreements, or other shipping problems may result in the loss or unavailability of inventory and/or delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores and customers.8Technology and Data Security RisksA material disruption in our computer systems could adversely affect our business or results of operations.We rely extensively on our computer systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Our computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber-attack or other security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, acts of war or terrorism, and usage errors by our employees. If our computer systems are damaged or cease to function properly, including a material disruption in our ability to authorize and process transactions at our stores or on our online systems, we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them, and we may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our operations. Any material interruption in our computer systems could negatively affect our business and results of operations.If our technology-based e-commerce systems do not function properly, our operating results could be negatively affected.Customers are increasingly using computers, tablets and smart phones to shop online and to do price and comparison shopping.  We strive to anticipate and meet our customers’ changing expectations and are focused on building a seamless shopping experience across our omnichannel business.  Any failure to provide user-friendly, secure e-commerce platforms that offer a variety of merchandise at competitive prices with low cost and quick delivery options that meet customers’ expectations could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of e-commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers and have a material adverse impact on the growth of our business and our operating results.A breach of information technology systems could adversely affect our reputation, business partner and customer relationships and operations, and result in high costs.Through our sales, marketing activities, and use of third-party information, we collect and store certain non-public personal information that customers provide to purchase products or services, enroll in promotional programs, register on websites, or otherwise communicate to us. This may include phone numbers, driver license numbers, contact preferences, personal information stored on electronic devices, and payment information, including credit and debit card data. We gather and retain information about employees in the normal course of business. We may share information about such persons with vendors that assist with certain aspects of our business. In addition, our online operations depend upon the transmission of confidential information over the Internet, such as information permitting cashless payments.    We employ safeguards for the protection of this information and have made significant investments to secure access to our information technology network.  For instance, we have implemented authentication protocols, installed firewalls and anti-virus/anti-malware software, conducted continuous risk assessments, and established data security breach preparedness and response plans.  We also employ encryption and other methods to protect our data, promote security awareness with our associates and work with business partners in an effort to create secure and compliant systems.     However, these protections may be compromised as a result of third-party security breaches, burglaries, cyberattacks, errors by employees or employees of third-party vendors, or contractors, misappropriation of data by employees, vendors or unaffiliated third-parties, or other irregularities that may result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to company data. Retail data frequently targeted by cybercriminals includes consumer credit card data, personally identifiable information, including social security numbers, and health care information.  For retailers, point of sale and e-commerce websites are often attacked through compromised credentials, including those obtained through phishing, vishing and credential stuffing. Other methods of attack include advanced malware, the exploitation of software and operating vulnerabilities, and physical device tampering/skimming at card reader units. We believe these attack methods will continue to evolve.  Despite instituting controls for the protection of such information, no commercial or government entity can be entirely free of vulnerability to attack or compromise given that the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service change frequently. During the normal course of business, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience attempts to compromise our information systems. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through fraud, trickery, or other forms of deception to employees, contractors, vendors and temporary staff.  We may be unable to protect the integrity of our systems or company data. An alleged or actual unauthorized access or unauthorized disclosure of non-public personal information could:9•materially damage our reputation and brand, negatively affect customer satisfaction and loyalty, expose us to individual claims or consumer class actions, administrative, civil or criminal investigations or actions, and infringe on proprietary information; and•cause us to incur substantial costs, including costs associated with remediation of information technology systems, customer protection costs and incentive payments for the maintenance of business relationships, litigation costs, lost revenues resulting from negative changes in consumer shopping patterns, unauthorized use of proprietary information or the failure to retain or attract customers following an attack. While we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk.Supply Chain and Third Party RisksWe depend upon designers, vendors and other sources of merchandise, goods and services. Our business could be affected by disruptions in, or other legal, regulatory, political or economic issues associated with, our supply network.Our relationships with established and emerging designers have been significant contributors to Macy's past success. Our ability to find qualified vendors and access products in a timely and efficient manner is often challenging, particularly with respect to goods sourced outside the United States. We source the majority of our merchandise from manufacturers located outside the U.S., primarily Asia.  Any major changes in tax policy, such as the disallowance of tax deductions for imported merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and liquidity. The procurement of all our goods and services are subject to the effects of price increases which we may or may not be able to pass through to our customers. In addition, our procurement of goods and services from outside the U.S. is subject to risks associated with political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to foreign trade. All of these factors may affect our ability to access suitable merchandise on acceptable terms, are beyond our control and could negatively affect our business and results of operations.On September 18, 2018, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative announced that the current U.S. Administration would impose a 10% tariff on approximately $200 billion worth of imports from China into the U.S. effective September 24, 2018, which was expected to increase to 25% starting January 1, 2019. On December 19, 2018, the U.S. Trade representative announced a modification to the effective date of the 25% tariffs on China goods from January 1, 2019 to March 2, 2019. We are evaluating the potential impact of the effective and proposed tariffs as well as other recent changes in foreign trade policy on our supply chain, costs, sales and profitability and are considering strategies to mitigate such impact, including reviewing sourcing options and working with our vendors and merchants. While it is too early to predict how these changes in foreign trade policy and any recently enacted, proposed and future tariffs on products imported by us from China will affect our business, these changes could negatively impact our business and results of operations if they seriously disrupt the movement of products through our supply chain or increase their cost. In addition, while we may be able to shift our sourcing options, executing such a shift would be time consuming and would be difficult or impracticable for many products and may result in an increase in our manufacturing costs. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, retaliatory tariffs, or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers, and/or the U.S. economy, which in turn could adversely impact our results of operations and business.Disruption of global sourcing activities and quality concerns over our own brands could negatively impact brand reputation and earnings.Economic and civil unrest in areas of the world where we source products, as well as shipping and dockage issues, could adversely impact the availability or cost of our products, or both.  Most of Macy’s goods imported to the U.S. arrive from Asia through ports located on the U.S. west coast and are subject to potential disruption due to labor unrest, security issues or natural disasters affecting any or all of these ports.  In addition, in recent years, we have substantially increased the number and types of merchandise that are sold under Macy’s proprietary brands.  While we have focused on the quality of our proprietary branded products, we rely on third-parties to manufacture these products.  Such third-party manufacturers may prove to be unreliable, the quality of our globally sourced products may vary from expectations and standards, the products may not meet applicable regulatory requirements which may require us to recall these products, or the products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third-parties.  We face challenges in seeking indemnities from manufacturers of these products, including the uncertainty of recovering on such indemnity and the lack of understanding by manufacturers of U.S. product liability laws in certain foreign jurisdictions.10Parties with whom Macy's does business may be subject to insolvency risks or may otherwise become unable or unwilling to perform on their obligations to us.Macy's is a party to contracts, transactions and business relationships with various third parties, including, without limitation, vendors, suppliers, service providers, lenders and participants in joint ventures, strategic alliances and other joint commercial relationships, pursuant to which such third parties have performance, payment and other obligations to Macy's. In some cases, we depend upon such third parties to provide essential leaseholds, products, services or other benefits, including with respect to store and distribution center locations, merchandise, advertising, software development and support, logistics, other agreements for goods and services to operate our business in the ordinary course, extensions of credit, credit card accounts and related receivables, and other vital matters. Current economic, industry and market conditions could result in increased risks to Macy's associated with the potential financial distress or insolvency of such third parties. If any of these third parties were to become subject to bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, the rights and benefits with respect to our contracts, transactions and business relationships with such third parties could be terminated, modified in a manner adverse to us, or otherwise impaired. We may be unable to arrange for alternate or replacement contracts, transactions or business relationships on terms as favorable as existing contracts, transactions or business relationships. Our inability to do so could negatively affect our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.Global, Legal and External RisksMacy’s business is subject to unfavorable economic and political conditions and other related risks.Unfavorable global, domestic or regional economic or political conditions and other developments and risks could negatively affect our business and results of operations. For example, unfavorable changes related to interest rates, rates of economic growth, fiscal and monetary policies of governments, inflation, deflation, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, consumer debt payment behaviors, tax rates and policy, unemployment trends, energy prices, and other matters that influence the availability and cost of merchandise, consumer confidence, spending and tourism could negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition, unstable political conditions, civil unrest, terrorist activities and armed conflicts may disrupt commerce and could negatively affect our business and results of operations.Our effective tax rate is impacted by a number of factors, including changes in federal or state tax law, interpretation of existing laws and the ability to defend and support the tax positions taken on historical tax returns.  Certain changes in any of these factors could materially impact the effective tax rate and net income.Our business could be affected by extreme weather conditions, regional or global health pandemics or natural disasters.Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located could negatively affect our business and results of operations. For example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales and profitability. Our business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could reduce demand for a portion of our inventory and thereby reduce our sales and profitability. In addition, extreme weather conditions could result in disruption or delay of production and delivery of materials and products in our supply chain and cause staffing shortages in our stores.Our business and results of operations could also be negatively affected if a regional or global health pandemic were to occur, depending upon its location, duration and severity. Customers might avoid public places, such as our stores, or in extreme cases governments might limit or ban public gatherings or travel. A regional or global health pandemic might also result in disruption or delay of production and delivery of materials and products in our supply chain and cause staffing shortages in our stores.Natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes, or a combination of these or other factors, could damage or destroy our facilities or make it difficult for customers to travel to our stores, thereby negatively affecting our business and results of operations.Litigation, legislation or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business and results of operations.We are subject to various federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations, inquiries and initiatives in connection with both our core business operations and our credit card and other ancillary operations (including the Credit Card Act of 2009 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010). Recent and future developments relating to such matters could increase our compliance costs and adversely affect the profitability of our credit card and other 11operations. We are also subject to anti-bribery, customs, child labor, truth-in-advertising and other laws, including consumer protection regulations and zoning and occupancy ordinances that regulate retailers generally and/or govern the importation, promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of retail stores and warehouse facilities. Although we undertake to monitor changes in these laws, if these laws change without our knowledge, or are violated by importers, designers, manufacturers, distributors or agents, we could experience delays in shipments and receipt of goods or be subject to fines or other penalties under the controlling regulations, any of which could negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition, we are regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Adverse outcomes in current or future litigation could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Financial RisksInability to access capital markets could adversely affect our business or financial condition.Changes in the credit and capital markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations, may increase the cost of financing or restrict our access to this potential source of future liquidity. A decrease in the ratings that rating agencies assign to Macy’s short and long-term debt may negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase our cost of borrowing. In addition, our bank credit agreements require us to maintain specified interest coverage and leverage ratios. Our ability to comply with the ratios may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If our results of operations or operating ratios deteriorate to a point where we are not in compliance with our debt covenants, and we are unable to obtain a waiver, much of our debt would be in default and could become due and payable immediately. Our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full this indebtedness, resulting in a need for an alternate source of funding. We cannot make any assurances that we would be able to obtain such an alternate source of funding on satisfactory terms, if at all, and our inability to do so could cause the holders of our securities to experience a partial or total loss of their investments in Macy's.Factors beyond our control could affect Macy's stock price.Macy’s stock price, like that of other retail companies, is subject to significant volatility because of many factors, including factors beyond our control. These factors may include:•general economic, stock, credit and real estate market conditions;•risks relating to Macy’s business and industry, including those discussed above;•strategic actions by us or our competitors;•adverse business announcements by our competitors;•variations in our quarterly results of operations;•future sales or purchases of Macy’s common stock; and•investor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with Macy’s common stock relative to other investment alternatives.We may fail to meet the expectations of our stockholders or of analysts at some time in the future. If the analysts who regularly follow Macy’s stock lower their rating or lower their projections for future growth and financial performance, Macy’s stock price could decline. Also, sales of a substantial number of shares of Macy’s common stock in the public market or the appearance that these shares are available for sale could adversely affect the market price of Macy’s common stock"
12,M,MACY'S INC,2018-04-04,"Risk Factors
.5In evaluating Macy's, the risks described below and the matters described in “Forward-Looking Statements” should be considered carefully. Such risks and matters are numerous and diverse, may be experienced continuously or intermittently, and may vary in intensity and effect. Any of such risks and matters, individually or in combination, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as on the attractiveness and value of an investment in Macy's securities.Strategic, Operational and Competitive RisksMacy’s strategic initiatives may not be successful, which could negatively affect our profitability and growth.We are pursuing strategic initiatives to achieve our objective of accelerating profitable growth in our stores and our digital operations. This includes the adoption of new technologies, merchandising strategies and customer service initiatives all designed to improve the shopping experience.  Our ability to achieve profitable growth is subject to the successful implementation of our strategic plans.  If these investments or initiatives do not perform as expected or create implementation or operational difficulties, we may incur impairment charges and our profitability and growth could suffer.Our sales and operating results depend on consumer preferences and consumer spending.The fashion and retail industries are subject to sudden shifts in consumer trends and consumer spending. Our sales and operating results depend in part on our ability to predict or respond to changes in fashion trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner. We develop new retail concepts and continuously adjust our industry position in certain major and private-label brands and product categories in an effort to satisfy customers. Any sustained failure to anticipate, identify and respond to emerging trends in lifestyle and consumer preferences could negatively affect our business and results of operations. Our sales are significantly affected by discretionary spending by consumers. Consumer spending may be affected by many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions, consumer disposable income levels, consumer confidence levels, the availability, cost and level of consumer debt and consumer behaviors towards incurring and paying debt, the costs of basic necessities and other goods, the strength of the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies and the effects of the weather or natural disasters. Any decline in discretionary spending by consumers could negatively affect our business and results of operations.As we rely on the ability of our physical retail locations to remain relevant, providing desirable and sought-out shopping experiences is paramount to our financial success.  Changes in consumer shopping habits, financial difficulties at other anchor tenants, significant mall vacancy issues, mall violence and new mall developments could each adversely impact the traffic at current retail locations and lead to a decline in our financial condition or performance.We may not be able to successfully execute our real estate strategy.We continue to explore opportunities to monetize our real estate portfolio, including sales of stores as well as non-store real estate such as warehouses, outparcels and parking garages. We also continue to evaluate our real estate portfolio to identify opportunities where the redevelopment value of our real estate exceeds the value of non-strategic operating locations.  This strategy is multi-pronged and may include transactions, strategic alliances or other arrangements with mall developers or unrelated third-parties.  Due to the cyclical nature of real estate markets, the performance of our real estate strategy is inherently volatile and could have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition.Macy’s revenues and cash requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of our business.Our business is seasonal, with a high proportion of revenues and operating cash flows generated during the second half of the year, which includes the fall and holiday selling seasons. A disproportionate amount of our revenues fall in the fourth quarter, which coincides with the holiday season. We incur significant additional expenses in the period leading up to the months of November and December in anticipation of higher sales volume in those periods, including for additional inventory, advertising and employees.We depend on our ability to attract and retain quality employees.Our business is dependent upon attracting and retaining quality employees. Macy's has a large number of employees, many of whom are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. Macy's ability to meet our labor needs while controlling the costs associated with hiring and training new employees is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation and changing demographics. In addition, as a large and complex enterprise operating in a highly competitive and challenging business environment, Macy's is highly dependent upon management personnel to develop and effectively execute successful business strategies and tactics.  Any 6circumstances that adversely impact our ability to attract, train, develop and retain quality employees throughout the organization could negatively affect our business and results of operations.Macy's depends on the success of advertising and marketing programs.Our business depends on effective marketing and high customer traffic. Macy's has many initiatives in this area, and we often change advertising and marketing programs. There can be no assurance as to our continued ability to effectively execute our advertising and marketing programs, and any failure to do so could negatively affect our business and results of operations.If cash flows from our private label credit card decrease, our financial and operational results may be negatively impacted.We sold most of our credit accounts and related receivables to Citibank.  Following the sale, we share in the economic performance of the credit card program with Citibank. Deterioration in economic or political conditions could adversely affect the volume of new credit accounts, the amount of credit card program balances and the ability of credit card holders to pay their balances. These conditions could result in Macy’s receiving lower payments under the credit card program.Credit card operations are subject to many federal and state laws that may impose certain requirements and limitations on credit card providers. Citibank and our subsidiary bank, FDS Bank, may be required to comply with regulations that may negatively impact the operation of our private label credit card. In turn, this negative impact may affect our revenue streams derived from the sale of such credit card accounts and negatively impact our financial results.Gross margins could suffer if we are unable to effectively manage our inventory.Our profitability depends on our ability to manage inventory levels and respond to shifts in consumer demand patterns. Overestimating customer demand for merchandise will likely result in the need to record inventory markdowns and sell excess inventory at clearance prices which would negatively impact our gross margins and operating results.  Underestimating customer demand for merchandise can lead to inventory shortages, missed sales opportunities and negative customer experiences.Our defined benefit plan funding requirements or plan settlement expense could impact our financial results and cash flow.Significant changes in interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and benefit payments could affect the funded status of our plans and could increase future funding requirements of the plans. A significant increase in future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.As of February 3, 2018, we had unrecognized actuarial losses of $992 million for the funded defined benefit pension plan (the “Pension Plan”) and $244 million for the unfunded defined benefit supplementary retirement plan (the “SERP”). These plans allow eligible retiring employees to receive lump sum distributions of benefits earned.  Under applicable accounting rules, if annual lump sum distributions exceed an actuarially determined threshold of the total of the annual service and interest costs, we would be required to recognize in the current period of operations a settlement expense of a portion of the unrecognized actuarial loss and could have a negative impact on our results of operations.Increases in the cost of employee benefits could impact our financial results and cash flow.Our expenses relating to employee health benefits are significant. Unfavorable changes in the cost of such benefits could negatively affect our financial results and cash flow. Healthcare costs have risen significantly in recent years, and recent legislative and private sector initiatives regarding healthcare reform have resulted and could continue to result in significant changes to the U.S. healthcare system. Due to uncertainty regarding legislative or regulatory changes, we are not able to fully determine the impact that future healthcare reform will have on our company-sponsored medical plans.If our company’s reputation and brand are not maintained at a high level, our operations and financial results may suffer.We believe our reputation and brand are partially based on the perception that we act equitably and honestly in dealing with our customers, employees, business partners and shareholders. Our reputation and brand may be deteriorated by any incident that erodes the trust or confidence of our customers or the general public, particularly if the incident results in significant adverse publicity or governmental inquiry. In addition, information concerning us, whether or not true, may be instantly and easily posted on social media platforms at any time, which information may be adverse to our reputation or brand. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction.  If our reputation or 7brand is damaged, our customers may refuse to continue shopping with us, potential employees may be unwilling to work for us, business partners may be discouraged from seeking future business dealings with us and, as a result, our operations and financial results may suffer.Macy's faces significant competition in the retail industry and we depend on our ability to differentiate Macy's in retail's ever-changing environment.We conduct our retail merchandising business under highly competitive conditions. Although Macy's is one of the nation’s largest retailers, we have numerous and varied competitors at the national and local levels, including department stores, specialty stores, general merchandise stores, off-price and discount stores, manufacturers’ outlets, online retailers, catalogs and television shopping, among others. Competition may intensify as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances. Competition is characterized by many factors, including assortment, advertising, price, quality, service, location, reputation and credit availability. Any failure by us to compete effectively could negatively affect our business and results of operations.  As consumers continue to migrate online, we face pressures to not only compete from a price perspective with our competitors, some of whom sell the same products, but also to differentiate Macy's to stay relevant in retail's ever-changing industry.  We continue to significantly invest in our omnichannel capabilities in order to provide a seamless shopping experience to our customers between our brick and mortar locations and our online and mobile environments.  Insufficient, untimely or misguided investments in this area could significantly impact our profitability and growth and affect our ability to attract new customers, as well as maintain our existing ones. In addition, declining customer store traffic and migration of sales from brick and mortar stores to digital platforms could lead to store closures, restructuring and other costs that could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. Our sales and operating results could be adversely affected by product safety concerns.If Macy's merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or consumers' expectations regarding safety, we could experience decreased sales, increased costs and/or be exposed to legal and reputational risk. Events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose Macy's to government enforcement action and/or private litigation. Reputational damage caused by real or perceived product safety concerns could negatively affect our business and results of operations.Technology and Data Security RisksA material disruption in our computer systems could adversely affect our business or results of operations.We rely extensively on our computer systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Our computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber-attack or other security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, acts of war or terrorism, and usage errors by our employees. If our computer systems are damaged or cease to function properly, including a material disruption in our ability to authorize and process transactions at our stores or on our online systems, we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them, and we may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our operations. Any material interruption in our computer systems could negatively affect our business and results of operations.If our technology-based e-commerce systems do not function properly, our operating results could be materially adversely affected.Customers are increasingly using computers, tablets and smart phones to shop online and to do price and comparison shopping.  We strive to anticipate and meet our customers’ changing expectations and are focused on building a seamless shopping experience across our omnichannel business.  Any failure to provide user-friendly, secure e-commerce platforms that offer a variety of merchandise at competitive prices with low cost and quick delivery options that meet customers’ expectations could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of e-commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers and have a material adverse impact on the growth of our business and our operating results.A breach of information technology systems could adversely affect our reputation, business partner and customer relationships, operations and result in high costs.Through our sales, marketing activities, and use of third-party information, we collect and store certain non-public personal information that customers provide to purchase products or services, enroll in promotional programs, register on websites, or otherwise communicate to us. This may include phone numbers, driver license numbers, contact preferences, personal information stored on electronic devices, and payment information, including credit and debit card data. We 8gather and retain information about employees in the normal course of business. We may share information about such persons with vendors that assist with certain aspects of our business. In addition, our online operations depend upon the transmission of confidential information over the Internet, such as information permitting cashless payments.    We employ safeguards for the protection of this information and have made significant investments to secure access to our information technology network.  For instance, we have implemented authentication protocols, installed firewalls and anti-virus/anti-malware software, conducted continuous risk assessments, and established data security breach preparedness and response plans.  We also employ encryption and other methods to protect our data, promote security awareness with our associates and work with business partners in an effort to create secure and compliant systems.     However, these protections may be compromised as a result of third-party security breaches, burglaries, cyberattack, errors by employees or employees of third-party vendors, or contractors, misappropriation of data by employees, vendors or unaffiliated third-parties, or other irregularities that may result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to company data. Retail data frequently targeted by cybercriminals is consumer credit card data, personally identifiable information, including social security numbers, and health care information.  For retailers, point of sale and e-commerce websites are often attacked through compromised credentials, including those obtained through phishing, vishing and credential stuffing. Other methods of attack include advanced malware, the exploitation of software and operating vulnerabilities, and physical device tampering/skimming at card reader units and we believe these attack methods will continue to evolve.  Despite instituting controls for the protection of such information, no commercial or government entity can be entirely free of vulnerability to attack or compromise given that the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service change frequently. During the normal course of business, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience attempts to compromise our information systems. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through fraud, trickery, or other forms of deception to employees, contractors, vendors and temporary staff.  We may be unable to protect the integrity of our systems or company data. An alleged or actual unauthorized access or unauthorized disclosure of non-public personal information could:•materially damage our reputation and brand, negatively affect customer satisfaction and loyalty, expose us to individual claims or consumer class actions, administrative, civil or criminal investigations or actions, and infringe on proprietary information; and•cause us to incur substantial costs, including costs associated with remediation of information technology systems, customer protection costs and incentive payments for the maintenance of business relationships, litigation costs, lost revenues resulting from negative changes in consumer shopping patterns, unauthorized use of proprietary information or the failure to retain or attract customers following an attack. While we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk.Supply Chain and Third Party RisksMacy's depends upon designers, vendors and other sources of merchandise, goods and services. Our business could be affected by disruptions in, or other legal, regulatory, political or economic issues associated with, our supply network.Our relationships with established and emerging designers have been a significant contributor to Macy's past success. Our ability to find qualified vendors and access products in a timely and efficient manner is often challenging, particularly with respect to goods sourced outside the United States. Our procurement of goods and services from outside the United States is subject to risks associated with political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to foreign trade.  We source the majority of our merchandise from manufacturers located outside of the U.S., primarily Asia, and any major changes in tax policy or trade relations, such as the disallowance of tax deductions for imported merchandise or the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported goods, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and liquidity.  In addition, the procurement of all our goods and services are subject to the effects of price increases which we may or may not be able to pass through to our customers. All of these factors may affect our ability to access suitable merchandise on acceptable terms, are beyond our control and could negatively affect our business and results of operationsDisruption of global sourcing activities and Macy's own brands’ quality concerns could negatively impact brand reputation and earnings.9Economic and civil unrest in areas of the world where we source products, as well as shipping and dockage issues, could adversely impact the availability or cost of our products, or both.  Most of Macy’s goods imported to the U.S. arrive from Asia through ports located on the U.S. west coast and are subject to potential disruption due to labor unrest, security issues or natural disasters affecting any or all of these ports.  In addition, in recent years, we have substantially increased the number and types of merchandise that are sold under Macy’s proprietary brands.  While we have focused on the quality of our proprietary branded products, we rely on third-parties to manufacture these products.  Such third-party manufacturers may prove to be unreliable, the quality of our globally sourced products may vary from expectations and standards, the products may not meet applicable regulatory requirements which may require us to recall these products, or the products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of other third-parties.  As we seek indemnities from manufacturers of these products, the uncertainty of recovering on such indemnity and the lack of understanding of U.S. product liability laws in certain foreign jurisdictions make it more likely that we may have to respond to claims or complaints from customers.Parties with whom Macy's does business may be subject to insolvency risks or may otherwise become unable or unwilling to perform on their obligations to us.Macy's is a party to contracts, transactions and business relationships with various third parties, including, without limitation, vendors, suppliers, service providers, lenders and participants in joint ventures, strategic alliances and other joint commercial relationships, pursuant to which such third parties have performance, payment and other obligations to Macy's. In some cases, we depend upon such third parties to provide essential leaseholds, products, services or other benefits, including with respect to store and distribution center locations, merchandise, advertising, software development and support, logistics, other agreements for goods and services in order to operate our business in the ordinary course, extensions of credit, credit card accounts and related receivables, and other vital matters. Current economic, industry and market conditions could result in increased risks to Macy's associated with the potential financial distress or insolvency of such third parties. If any of these third parties were to become subject to bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, the rights and benefits with respect to our contracts, transactions and business relationships with such third parties could be terminated, modified in a manner adverse to us, or otherwise impaired. We may be unable to arrange for alternate or replacement contracts, transactions or business relationships on terms as favorable as existing contracts, transactions or business relationships. Our inability to do so could negatively affect our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.Global, Legal and External RisksMacy’s business is subject to unfavorable economic and political conditions and other related risks.Unfavorable global, domestic or regional economic or political conditions and other developments and risks could negatively affect our business and results of operations. For example, unfavorable changes related to interest rates, rates of economic growth, fiscal and monetary policies of governments, inflation, deflation, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, consumer debt payment behaviors, tax rates and policy, unemployment trends, energy prices, and other matters that influence the availability and cost of merchandise, consumer confidence, spending and tourism could negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition, unstable political conditions, civil unrest, terrorist activities and armed conflicts may disrupt commerce and could negatively affect our business and results of operations.Our effective tax rate is impacted by a number of factors, including changes in federal or state tax law, interpretation of existing laws and the ability to defend and support the tax positions taken on historical tax returns.  Certain changes in any of these factors could materially impact the effective tax rate and net income.Our business could be affected by extreme weather conditions, regional or global health pandemics or natural disasters.Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located could negatively affect our business and results of operations. For example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales and profitability. Our business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could reduce demand for a portion of our inventory and thereby reduce our sales and profitability. In addition, extreme weather conditions could result in disruption or delay of production and delivery of materials and products in our supply chain and cause staffing shortages in our stores.Our business and results of operations could also be negatively affected if a regional or global health pandemic were to occur, depending upon its location, duration and severity. To halt or delay the spread of disease, local, regional or national governments might limit or ban public gatherings or customers might avoid public places, such as our stores. A 10regional or global health pandemic might also result in disruption or delay of production and delivery of materials and products in our supply chain and cause staffing shortages in our stores.Natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes, or a combination of these or other factors, could damage or destroy our facilities or make it difficult for customers to travel to our stores, thereby negatively affecting our business and results of operations.Litigation, legislation or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business and results of operations.We are subject to various federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations, inquiries and initiatives in connection with both our core business operations and our credit card and other ancillary operations (including the Credit Card Act of 2009 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010). Recent and future developments relating to such matters could increase our compliance costs and adversely affect the profitability of our credit card and other operations. We are also subject to anti-bribery, customs, child labor, truth-in-advertising and other laws, including consumer protection regulations and zoning and occupancy ordinances that regulate retailers generally and/or govern the importation, promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of retail stores and warehouse facilities. Although we undertake to monitor changes in these laws, if these laws change without our knowledge, or are violated by importers, designers, manufacturers, distributors or agents, we could experience delays in shipments and receipt of goods or be subject to fines or other penalties under the controlling regulations, any of which could negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition, we are regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Adverse outcomes in current or future litigation could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Financial RisksInability to access capital markets could adversely affect our business or financial condition.Changes in the credit and capital markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations, may increase the cost of financing or restrict our access to this potential source of future liquidity. A decrease in the ratings that rating agencies assign to Macy’s short and long-term debt may negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase our cost of borrowing. In addition, our bank credit agreements require us to maintain specified interest coverage and leverage ratios. Our ability to comply with the ratios may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If our results of operations or operating ratios deteriorate to a point where we are not in compliance with our debt covenants, and we are unable to obtain a waiver, much of our debt would be in default and could become due and payable immediately. Our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full this indebtedness, resulting in a need for an alternate source of funding. We cannot make any assurances that we would be able to obtain such an alternate source of funding on satisfactory terms, if at all, and our inability to do so could cause the holders of our securities to experience a partial or total loss of their investments in Macy's.Factors beyond our control could affect Macy's stock price.Macy’s stock price, like that of other retail companies, is subject to significant volatility because of many factors, including factors beyond our control. These factors may include:•general economic, stock, credit and real estate market conditions;•risks relating to Macy’s business and industry, including those discussed above;•strategic actions by us or our competitors;•variations in our quarterly results of operations;•future sales or purchases of Macy’s Common Stock; and•investor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with Macy’s Common Stock relative to other investment alternatives.We may fail to meet the expectations of our stockholders or of analysts at some time in the future. If the analysts that regularly follow Macy’s stock lower their rating or lower their projections for future growth and financial performance, Macy’s stock price could decline. Also, sales of a substantial number of shares of Macy’s Common Stock in the public market or the appearance that these shares are available for sale could adversely affect the market price of Macy’s Common Stock.11"
16,M,MACY'S INC,2017-03-29,"Risk Factors
.In evaluating the Company, the risks described below and the matters described in “Forward-Looking Statements” should be considered carefully. Such risks and matters are numerous and diverse, may be experienced continuously or intermittently, and may vary in intensity and effect. Any of such risks and matters, individually or in combination, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as on the attractiveness and value of an investment in the Company's securities.The Company faces significant competition in the retail industry and depends on its ability to differentiate itself in retail's ever-changing environment.The Company conducts its retail merchandising business under highly competitive conditions. Although the Company is one of the nation’s largest retailers, it has numerous and varied competitors at the national and local levels, including department stores, specialty stores, general merchandise stores, off-price and discount stores, manufacturers’ outlets, online retailers, catalogs and television shopping, among others. Competition may intensify as the Company’s competitors enter into business combinations or alliances. Competition is characterized by many factors, including assortment, advertising, price, quality, service, location, reputation and credit availability. Any failure by the Company to compete effectively could negatively affect the Company's business and results of operations.  As consumers continue to migrate online, the Company faces pressures to not only compete from a price perspective with its competitors, some of whom sell the same products, but also must differentiate itself to stay relevant in retail's ever-changing industry.  The Company continues to significantly invest in its omnichannel capabilities in order to provide a seamless shopping experience to its customers between the Company's brick and mortar locations and its online and mobile environments.  Insufficient, untimely or misguided investments in this area could significantly impact the Company's profitability and growth and affect the Company's ability to attract new customers as well as maintain its existing ones.The Company’s sales and operating results depend on consumer preferences and consumer spending.The fashion and retail industries are subject to sudden shifts in consumer trends and consumer spending. The Company’s sales and operating results depend in part on its ability to predict or respond to changes in fashion trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner. The Company develops new retail concepts and continuously adjusts its industry position in certain major and private-label brands and product categories in an effort to satisfy customers. Any sustained failure to anticipate, identify and respond to emerging trends in lifestyle and consumer preferences could negatively affect the Company’s business and results of operations. The Company’s sales are significantly affected by discretionary spending by consumers. Consumer spending may be affected by many factors outside of the Company’s control, including general economic conditions, consumer disposable income levels, consumer confidence levels, the availability, cost and level of consumer debt and consumer behaviors towards incurring and paying debt, the costs of basic necessities and other goods, the strength of the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies and the effects of the weather or natural disasters. Any decline in discretionary spending by consumers could negatively affect the Company's business and results of operations.6As the Company relies on the ability of its physical retail locations to remain relevant, providing desirable and sought-out shopping experiences is paramount to the Company's financial success.  Changes in consumer shopping habits, financial difficulties at other anchor tenants, significant mall vacancy issues, mall violence and new mall developments could each adversely impact the traffic at current retail locations and lead to a decline in the Company's financial condition or performance.The Company’s business is subject to unfavorable economic and political conditions and other related risks.Unfavorable global, domestic or regional economic or political conditions and other developments and risks could negatively affect the Company’s business and results of operations. For example, unfavorable changes related to interest rates, rates of economic growth, fiscal and monetary policies of governments, inflation, deflation, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, consumer debt payment behaviors, tax rates and policy, unemployment trends, energy prices, and other matters that influence the availability and cost of merchandise, consumer confidence, spending and tourism could negatively affect the Company’s business and results of operations. These same conditions and related risks could affect the success of the Company's credit card program. Following the sale of most of the Company's credit accounts and related receivables to Citibank, the Company shares in the economic performance of the credit card program with CitiBank. Deterioration in economic or political conditions could adversely affect the volume of new credit accounts, the amount of credit card program balances and the ability of credit card holders to pay their balances. These conditions could result in the Company receiving lower payments under the credit card program. In addition, unstable political conditions, civil unrest, terrorist activities and armed conflicts may disrupt commerce and could negatively affect the Company’s business and results of operations.The Company's effective tax rate is impacted by a number of factors, including changes in federal or state tax law, interpretation of existing laws and the ability to defend and support the tax positions taken on historical tax returns.  Certain changes in any of these factors could materially impact the effective tax rate and the Company's net income.The Company’s revenues and cash requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of its business.The Company’s business is seasonal, with a high proportion of revenues and operating cash flows generated during the second half of the year, which includes the fall and holiday selling seasons. A disproportionate amount of the Company's revenues fall in the fourth quarter, which coincides with the holiday season. In addition, the Company incurs significant additional expenses in the period leading up to the months of November and December in anticipation of higher sales volume in those periods, including for additional inventory, advertising and employees.The Company’s business could be affected by extreme weather conditions, regional or global health pandemics or natural disasters.Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which the Company’s stores are located could negatively affect the Company’s business and results of operations. For example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for the Company’s customers to travel to its stores and thereby reduce the Company’s sales and profitability. The Company’s business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could reduce demand for a portion of the Company’s inventory and thereby reduce the Company's sales and profitability. In addition, extreme weather conditions could result in disruption or delay of production and delivery of materials and products in the Company's supply chain and cause staffing shortages in the Company's stores.The Company's business and results of operations could also be negatively affected if a regional or global health pandemic were to occur, depending upon its location, duration and severity. To halt or delay the spread of disease, local, regional or national governments might limit or ban public gatherings or customers might avoid public places, such as the Company's stores. A regional or global health pandemic might also result in disruption or delay of production and delivery of materials and products in the Company's supply chain and cause staffing shortages in the Company's stores.In addition, natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes, or a combination of these or other factors, could damage or destroy the Company’s facilities or make it difficult for customers to travel to its stores, thereby negatively affecting the Company’s business and results of operations.7The Company’s defined benefit plan funding requirements or plan settlement expense could impact the Company’s financial results and cash flow.Significant changes in interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and benefit payments could affect the funded status of the Company’s plans and could increase future funding requirements of the plans. A significant increase in future funding requirements could have a negative impact on the Company’s cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.As of January 28, 2017, the Company had unrecognized actuarial losses of $1,232 million for the funded defined benefit pension plan (the “Pension Plan”) and $248 million for the unfunded defined benefit supplementary retirement plan (the “SERP”). These plans allow eligible retiring employees to receive lump sum distributions of benefits earned.  Under applicable accounting rules, if annual lump sum distributions exceed an actuarially determined threshold of the total of the annual service and interest costs, the Company would be required to recognize in the current period of operations a settlement expense of a portion of the unrecognized actuarial loss and could have a negative impact on the Company’s results of operations.Increases in the cost of employee benefits could impact the Company’s financial results and cash flow.The Company’s expenses relating to employee health benefits are significant. Unfavorable changes in the cost of such benefits could negatively affect the Company’s financial results and cash flow. Healthcare costs have risen significantly in recent years, and recent legislative and private sector initiatives regarding healthcare reform have resulted and could continue to result in significant changes to the U.S. healthcare system. Due to uncertainty regarding legislative or regulatory changes  to the Affordable Care Act and related legislation, the Company is not able at this time to fully determine the impact that future healthcare reform will have on Company-sponsored medical plans.Inability to access capital markets could adversely affect the Company’s business or financial condition.Changes in the credit and capital markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations, may increase the cost of financing or restrict the Company’s access to this potential source of future liquidity. A decrease in the ratings that rating agencies assign to the Company’s short and long-term debt may negatively impact the Company’s access to the debt capital markets and increase the Company’s cost of borrowing. In addition, the Company’s bank credit agreements require the Company to maintain specified interest coverage and leverage ratios. The Company’s ability to comply with the ratios may be affected by events beyond its control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If the Company’s results of operations or operating ratios deteriorate to a point where the Company is not in compliance with its debt covenants, and the Company is unable to obtain a waiver, much of the Company’s debt would be in default and could become due and payable immediately. The Company’s assets may not be sufficient to repay in full this indebtedness, resulting in a need for an alternate source of funding. The Company cannot make any assurances that it would be able to obtain such an alternate source of funding on satisfactory terms, if at all, and its inability to do so could cause the holders of its securities to experience a partial or total loss of their investments in the Company.The Company depends on its ability to attract and retain quality employees.The Company’s business is dependent upon attracting and retaining quality employees. The Company has a large number of employees, many of whom are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. The Company’s ability to meet its labor needs while controlling the costs associated with hiring and training new employees is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation and changing demographics. In addition, as a large and complex enterprise operating in a highly competitive and challenging business environment, the Company is highly dependent upon management personnel to develop and effectively execute successful business strategies and tactics.  Any circumstances that adversely impact the Company’s ability to attract, train, develop and retain quality employees throughout the organization could negatively affect the Company’s business and results of operations.The Company depends upon designers, vendors and other sources of merchandise, goods and services. The Company's business could be affected by disruptions in, or other legal, regulatory, political or economic issues associated with, the Company's supply network.The Company’s relationships with established and emerging designers have been a significant contributor to the Company’s past success. The Company’s ability to find qualified vendors and access products in a timely and efficient manner is often challenging, particularly with respect to goods sourced outside the United States. The Company’s procurement of goods and services from outside the United States is subject to risks associated with political or financial 8instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to foreign trade.  The Company sources the majority of its merchandise from manufacturers located outside of the U.S., primarily Asia, and any major changes in tax policy or trade relations, such as the disallowance of tax deductions for imported merchandise or the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported goods, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and liquidity.  The Company is also subject to costs and uncertainties associated with efforts to identify and disclose sources of ""conflict minerals"" used in products that the Company causes to be manufactured and potential sell-through difficulties and reputational damage that may be associated with the inability of the Company to determine that such products are ""DRC conflict-free."" In addition, the Company’s procurement of all its goods and services is subject to the effects of price increases which the Company may or may not be able to pass through to its customers. All of these factors may affect the Company’s ability to access suitable merchandise on acceptable terms, are beyond the Company’s control and could negatively affect the Company’s business and results of operationsThe Company's sales and operating results could be adversely affected by product safety concerns.If the Company's merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or consumers' expectations regarding safety, the Company could experience decreased sales, increased costs and/or be exposed to legal and reputational risk. Events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose the Company to government enforcement action and/or private litigation. Reputational damage caused by real or perceived product safety concerns could negatively affect the Company's business and results of operations.The Company depends on the success of its advertising and marketing programs.The Company’s business depends on effective marketing and high customer traffic. The Company has many initiatives in this area, and often changes its advertising and marketing programs. There can be no assurance as to the Company’s continued ability to effectively execute its advertising and marketing programs, and any failure to do so could negatively affect the Company’s business and results of operations.Parties with whom the Company does business may be subject to insolvency risks or may otherwise become unable or unwilling to perform their obligations to the Company.The Company is a party to contracts, transactions and business relationships with various third parties, including, without limitation, vendors, suppliers, service providers, lenders and participants in joint ventures, strategic alliances and other joint commercial relationships, pursuant to which such third parties have performance, payment and other obligations to the Company. In some cases, the Company depends upon such third parties to provide essential leaseholds, products, services or other benefits, including with respect to store and distribution center locations, merchandise, advertising, software development and support, logistics, other agreements for goods and services in order to operate the Company’s business in the ordinary course, extensions of credit, credit card accounts and related receivables, and other vital matters. Current economic, industry and market conditions could result in increased risks to the Company associated with the potential financial distress or insolvency of such third parties. If any of these third parties were to become subject to bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, the rights and benefits of the Company in relation to its contracts, transactions and business relationships with such third parties could be terminated, modified in a manner adverse to the Company, or otherwise impaired. The Company cannot make any assurances that it would be able to arrange for alternate or replacement contracts, transactions or business relationships on terms as favorable as the Company’s existing contracts, transactions or business relationships, if at all. Any inability on the part of the Company to do so could negatively affect the Company’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.A material disruption in the Company’s computer systems could adversely affect the Company’s business or results of operations.The Company relies extensively on its computer systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage its business. The Company’s computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber-attack or other security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, acts of war or terrorism, and usage errors by the Company’s employees. If the Company’s computer systems are damaged or cease to function properly, the Company may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them, and the Company may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in its operations. Any material interruption in the Company’s computer systems could negatively affect its business and results of operations.9A breach of information technology systems could adversely affect the Company's reputation, business partner and customer relationships, operations and result in high costs.Through the Company's sales, marketing activities, and use of third-party information, the Company collects and stores certain non-public personal information that customers provide to purchase products or services, enroll in promotional programs, register on websites, or otherwise communicate to the Company. This may include, but is not limited to, phone numbers, driver license numbers, contact preferences, personal information stored on electronic devices, and payment information, including credit and debit card data. The Company also gathers and retains information about employees in the normal course of business. The Company may share information about such persons with vendors that assist with certain aspects of the Company's business. In addition, the Company's online operations depend upon the transmission of confidential information over the Internet, such as information permitting cashless payments.    The Company employs safeguards for the protection of such information. These protections may be compromised as a result of third-party security breaches, burglaries, cyberattack, errors by employees or employees of third-party vendors, or contractors, misappropriation of data by employees, vendors or unaffiliated third-parties, or other irregularities that may result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to company data. Despite instituting controls for the protection of such information, no commercial or government entity can be entirely free of vulnerability to attack or compromise given that the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service change frequently. During the normal course of business, the Company has experienced and expects to continue to experience attempts to compromise information systems security. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to the Company's systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom the Company does business, through fraud, trickery, or other forms of deception to employees, contractors, vendors and temporary staff.  The Company may be unable to protect the integrity of systems or company data. Moreover, an alleged or actual unauthorized access or unauthorized disclosure of non-public personal information could:•materially damage the Company's reputation and brand, negatively affect customer satisfaction and loyalty, expose the Company to individual claims or consumer class actions, administrative, civil or criminal investigations or actions, and infringe on proprietary information; and•cause the Company to incur substantial costs, including but not limited to, costs associated with remediation of information technology systems, customer protection costs and incentive payments for the maintenance of business relationships, litigation costs, lost revenues resulting from negative changes in consumer shopping patterns, unauthorized use of proprietary information or the failure to retain or attract customers following an attack. While the Company maintains insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk.Disruption of global sourcing activities and the Company's own brands' quality concerns could negatively impact brand reputation and earningsEconomic and civil unrest in areas of the world where the Company source products, as well as shipping and dockage issues, could adversely impact the availability or cost of the Company’s products, or both.  Most of the Company’s goods imported to the U.S. arrive from Asia through ports located on the U.S. west coast and are, therefore, subject to potential disruption due to labor unrest, security issues or natural disasters affecting any or all of these ports.  In addition, in recent years, the Company has substantially increased the number and types of merchandise that are sold under the Company’s proprietary brands.  While the Company has focused on the quality of its proprietary branded products, the Company relies on third-parties to manufacture these products.  Such third-party manufacturers may prove to be unreliable, the quality of the Company’s globally sourced products may vary from the Company’s expectations and standards, such products may not meet applicable regulatory requirements which may require the Company to recall these products, or such products may infringe upon the intellectual propriety rights of other third-parties.  Moreover, as the Company seeks indemnities from manufactures of these products, the uncertainty of realization of any such indemnity and the lack of understanding of U.S. product liability laws in certain foreign jurisdictions make it more likely that the Company may have to respond to claims or complaints from customers.Litigation, legislation or regulatory developments could adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations.The Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations, inquiries and initiatives in connection with both its core business operations and its credit card and other ancillary operations (including the Credit Card Act of 2009 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”)). 10Recent and future developments relating to such matters could increase the Company's compliance costs and adversely affect the profitability of its credit card and other operations. The Company is also subject to anti-bribery, customs, child labor, truth-in-advertising and other laws, including consumer protection regulations and zoning and occupancy ordinances that regulate retailers generally and/or govern the importation, promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of retail stores and warehouse facilities. Although the Company undertakes to monitor changes in these laws, if these laws change without the Company's knowledge, or are violated by importers, designers, manufacturers, distributors or agents, the Company could experience delays in shipments and receipt of goods or be subject to fines or other penalties under the controlling regulations, any of which could negatively affect the Company's business and results of operations. In addition, the Company is regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of its business. Adverse outcomes in current or future litigation could negatively affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The Company may not be able to successfully execute its real estate strategy.The Company continues to explore opportunities to monetize its real estate portfolio and is focused on opportunities for sale transactions and, in some cases, redevelopment of assets.  This strategy is multi-pronged and may include transactions, strategic alliances or other arrangements with mall developers or unrelated third-parties.  Due to the cyclical nature of real estate markets, the performance of the Company's real estate strategy is inherently volatile and could have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.Factors beyond the Company’s control could affect the Company’s stock price.The Company’s stock price, like that of other retail companies, is subject to significant volatility because of many factors, including factors beyond the control of the Company. These factors may include:•general economic, stock, credit and real estate market conditions;•risks relating to the Company’s business and its industry, including those discussed above;•strategic actions by the Company or its competitors;•variations in the Company’s quarterly results of operations;•future sales or purchases of the Company’s common stock; and•investor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with the Company’s common stock relative to other investment alternatives.In addition, the Company may fail to meet the expectations of its stockholders or of analysts at some time in the future. If the analysts that regularly follow the Company’s stock lower their rating or lower their projections for future growth and financial performance, the Company’s stock price could decline. Also, sales of a substantial number of shares of the Company’s common stock in the public market or the appearance that these shares are available for sale could adversely affect the market price of the Company’s common stock"

The Company’s sales are significantly affected by discretionary spending by consumers. Consumer spending may be affected by many factors outside of the Company’s control, including general economic conditions, consumer disposable income levels, consumer confidence levels, the availability, cost and level of consumer debt and consumer behaviors towards incurring and paying debt, the costs of basic necessities and other goods, the strength of the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies and the effects of the weather or natural disasters. Any decline in discretionary spending by consumers could negatively affect the Company's business and results of operations.5The Company’s business is subject to unfavorable economic and political conditions and other developments and risks.Unfavorable global, domestic or regional economic or political conditions and other developments and risks could negatively affect the Company’s business and results of operations. For example, unfavorable changes related to interest rates, rates of economic growth, fiscal and monetary policies of governments, inflation, deflation, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, consumer debt payment behaviors, tax rates and policy, unemployment trends, energy prices, and other matters that influence the availability and cost of merchandise, consumer confidence, spending and tourism could negatively affect the Company’s business and results of operations. In addition, unstable political conditions, civil unrest, terrorist activities and armed conflicts may disrupt commerce and could negatively affect the Company’s business and results of operations.The Company’s revenues and cash requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of its business.The Company’s business is seasonal, with a high proportion of revenues and operating cash flows generated during the second half of the year, which includes the fall and holiday selling seasons.

For example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for the Company’s customers to travel to its stores and thereby reduce the Company’s sales and profitability. The Company’s business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could reduce demand for a portion of the Company’s inventory and thereby reduce the Company's sales and profitability. In addition, extreme weather conditions could result in disruption or delay of production and delivery of materials and products in the Company's supply chain and cause staffing shortages in the Company's stores.The Company's business and results of operations could also be negatively affected if a regional or global health pandemic were to occur, depending upon its location, duration and severity. To halt or delay the spread of disease, local, regional or national governments might limit or ban public gatherings or customers might avoid public places, such as the Company's stores. A regional or global health pandemic might also result in disruption or delay of production and delivery of materials and products in the Company's supply chain and cause staffing shortages in the Company's stores.In addition, natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes, or a combination of these or other factors, could damage or destroy the Company’s facilities or make it difficult for customers to travel to its stores, thereby negatively affecting the Company’s business and results of operations.The Company’s defined benefit plan funding requirements or plan settlement expense could impact the Company’s financial results and cash flow.Significant changes in interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and benefit payments could affect the funded status of the Company’s plans and could increase future funding requirements of the plans. A significant increase in future funding requirements could have a negative impact on the Company’s cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.At January 30, 2016, the Company had unrecognized actuarial losses of $1,451 million for the funded defined benefit pension plan (the “Pension Plan”) and $261 million for the unfunded defined benefit supplementary retirement plan (the “SERP”). These plans allow eligible retiring employees to receive lump sum distributions of benefits earned.  Under applicable accounting rules, if annual lump sum distributions exceed an actuarially determined threshold of the total of the annual service and interest costs, the Company would be required to recognize in the current period of operations a settlement expense of a portion of the unrecognized actuarial loss and could have a negative impact on the Company’s results of operations.6Increases in the cost of employee benefits could impact the Company’s financial results and cash flow.The Company’s expenses relating to employee health benefits are significant. Unfavorable changes in the cost of such benefits could negatively affect the Company’s financial results and cash flow. Healthcare costs have risen significantly in recent years, and recent legislative and private sector initiatives regarding healthcare reform have resulted and could continue to result in significant changes to the U.S. healthcare system. Due to the breadth and complexity of the healthcare reform legislation, the lack of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance and the phased-in nature of the implementation of the legislation, the Company is not able at this time to fully determine the impact that healthcare reform will have on the Company-sponsored medical plans.Inability to access capital markets could adversely affect the Company’s business or financial condition.Changes in the credit and capital markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations, may increase the cost of financing or restrict the Company’s access to this potential source of future liquidity. A decrease in the ratings that rating agencies assign to the Company’s short and long-term debt may negatively impact the Company’s access to the debt capital markets and increase the Company’s cost of borrowing. In addition, the Company’s bank credit agreements require the Company to maintain specified interest coverage and leverage ratios. The Company’s ability to comply with the ratios may be affected by events beyond its control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If the Company’s results of operations or operating ratios deteriorate to a point where the Company is not in compliance with its debt covenants, and the Company is unable to obtain a waiver, much of the Company’s debt would be in default and could become due and payable immediately. The Company’s assets may not be sufficient to repay in full this indebtedness, resulting in a need for an alternate source of funding. The Company cannot make any assurances that it would be able to obtain such an alternate source of funding on satisfactory terms, if at all, and its inability to do so could cause the holders of its securities to experience a partial or total loss of their investments in the Company.The Company depends on its ability to attract and retain quality employees.The Company’s business is dependent upon attracting and retaining quality employees. The Company has a large number of employees, many of whom are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. The Company’s ability to meet its labor needs while controlling the costs associated with hiring and training new employees is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation and changing demographics. In addition, as a large and complex enterprise operating in a highly competitive and challenging business environment, the Company is highly dependent upon management personnel to develop and effectively execute successful business strategies and tactics.  Any circumstances that adversely impact the Company’s ability to attract, train, develop and retain quality employees throughout the organization could negatively affect the Company’s business and results of operations.The Company depends upon designers, vendors and other sources of merchandise, goods and services. The Company's business could be affected by disruptions in, or other legal, regulatory, political or economic issues associated with, our supply network.The Company’s relationships with established and emerging designers have been a significant contributor to the Company’s past success. The Company’s ability to find qualified vendors and access products in a timely and efficient manner is often challenging, particularly with respect to goods sourced outside the United States. The Company’s procurement of goods and services from outside the United States is subject to risks associated with political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to foreign trade, including costs and uncertainties associated with efforts to identify and disclose sources of ""conflict minerals"" used in products that the Company causes to be manufactured and potential sell-through difficulties and reputational damage that may be associated with the inability of the Company to determine that such products are ""DRC conflict-free."" In addition, the Company’s procurement of all its goods and services is subject to the effects of price increases which the Company may or may not be able to pass through to its customers. All of these factors may affect the Company’s ability to access suitable merchandise on acceptable terms, are beyond the Company’s control and could negatively affect the Company’s business and results of operations.7The Company's sales and operating results could be adversely affected by product safety concerns.If the Company's merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our consumers' expectations regarding safety, the Company could experience decreased sales, experience increased costs and/or be exposed to legal and reputational risk. Events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose the Company to government enforcement action and/or private litigation. Reputational damage caused by real or perceived product safety concerns could negatively affect the Company's business and results of operations.The Company depends upon the success of its advertising and marketing programs.The Company’s business depends on effective marketing and high customer traffic. The Company has many initiatives in this area, and often changes its advertising and marketing programs. There can be no assurance as to the Company’s continued ability to effectively execute its advertising and marketing programs, and any failure to do so could negatively affect the Company’s business and results of operations.Parties with whom the Company does business may be subject to insolvency risks or may otherwise become unable or unwilling to perform their obligations to the Company.The Company is a party to contracts, transactions and business relationships with various third parties, including, without limitation, vendors, suppliers, service providers, lenders and participants in joint ventures, strategic alliances and other joint commercial relationships, pursuant to which such third parties have performance, payment and other obligations to the Company. In some cases, the Company depends upon such third parties to provide essential leaseholds, products, services or other benefits, including with respect to store and distribution center locations, merchandise, advertising, software development and support, logistics, other agreements for goods and services in order to operate the Company’s business in the ordinary course, extensions of credit, credit card accounts and related receivables, and other vital matters. Current economic, industry and market conditions could result in increased risks to the Company associated with the potential financial distress or insolvency of such third parties. If any of these third parties were to become subject to bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, the rights and benefits of the Company in relation to its contracts, transactions and business relationships with such third parties could be terminated, modified in a manner adverse to the Company, or otherwise impaired. The Company cannot make any assurances that it would be able to arrange for alternate or replacement contracts, transactions or business relationships on terms as favorable as the Company’s existing contracts, transactions or business relationships, if at all. Any inability on the part of the Company to do so could negatively affect the Company’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.A material disruption in the Company’s computer systems could adversely affect the Company’s business or results of operations.The Company relies extensively on its computer systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage its business. The Company’s computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber-attack or other security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, acts of war or terrorism, and usage errors by the Company’s employees. If the Company’s computer systems are damaged or cease to function properly, the Company may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them, and the Company may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in its operations. Any material interruption in the Company’s computer systems could negatively affect its business and results of operations.A data breach could result in negative publicity and adversely affect the Company’s business or results of operations.The protection of customer, employee, and company data is critical to the Company. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements across business units. In addition, customers have a high expectation that the Company will adequately protect their personal information from cyber-attack or other security breaches. A significant breach of customer, employee, or company data could attract a substantial amount of media attention, damage the Company’s customer relationships and reputation and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits.8Litigation, legislation or regulatory developments could adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations.The Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations, inquiries and initiatives in connection with both its core business operations and its credit card and other ancillary operations (including the Credit Card Act of 2009 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”)). Recent and future developments relating to such matters could increase the Company's compliance costs and adversely affect the profitability of its credit card and other operations. The Company is also subject to anti-bribery, customs, child labor, truth-in-advertising and other laws, including consumer protection regulations and zoning and occupancy ordinances that regulate retailers generally and/or govern the importation, promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of retail stores and warehouse facilities. Although the Company undertakes to monitor changes in these laws, if these laws change without the Company's knowledge, or are violated by importers, designers, manufacturers, distributors or agents, the Company could experience delays in shipments and receipt of goods or be subject to fines or other penalties under the controlling regulations, any of which could negatively affect the Company's business and results of operations. In addition, the Company is regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of its business. Adverse outcomes in current or future litigation could negatively affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Factors beyond the Company’s control could affect the Company’s stock price.The Company’s stock price, like that of other retail companies, is subject to significant volatility because of many factors, including factors beyond the control of the Company. These factors may include:•general economic, stock, credit and real estate market conditions;•risks relating to the Company’s business and its industry, including those discussed above;•strategic actions by the Company or its competitors;•variations in the Company’s quarterly results of operations;•future sales or purchases of the Company’s common stock; and•investor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with the Company’s common stock relative to other investment alternatives.In addition, the Company may fail to meet the expectations of its stockholders or of analysts at some time in the future. If the analysts that regularly follow the Company’s stock lower their rating or lower their projections for future growth and financial performance, the Company’s stock price could decline. Also, sales of a substantial number of shares of the Company’s common stock in the public market or the appearance that these shares are available for sale could adversely affect the market price of the Company’s common stock"

.In evaluating the Company, the risks described below and the matters described in “Forward-Looking Statements” should be considered carefully. Such risks and matters are numerous and diverse, may be experienced continuously or intermittently, and may vary in intensity and effect. Any of such risks and matters, individually or in combination, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as on the attractiveness and value of an investment in the Company's securities.The Company faces significant competition in the retail industry.The Company conducts its retail merchandising business under highly competitive conditions. Although the Company is one of the nation’s largest retailers, it has numerous and varied competitors at the national and local levels, including department stores, specialty stores, general merchandise stores, off-price and discount stores, manufacturers’ outlets, online retailers, mail order catalogs and television shopping, among others. Competition may intensify as the Company’s competitors enter into business combinations or alliances. Competition is characterized by many factors, including assortment, advertising, price, quality, service, location, reputation and credit availability. Any failure by the Company to compete effectively could negatively affect the Company's business and results of operations.The Company’s sales and operating results depend on consumer preferences and consumer spending.The fashion and retail industries are subject to sudden shifts in consumer trends and consumer spending. The Company’s sales and operating results depend in part on its ability to predict or respond to changes in fashion trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner. The Company develops new retail concepts and continuously adjusts its industry position in certain major and private-label brands and product categories in an effort to satisfy customers. Any sustained failure to anticipate, identify and respond to emerging trends in lifestyle and consumer preferences could negatively affect the Company’s business and results of operations. The Company’s sales are significantly affected by discretionary spending by consumers. Consumer spending may be affected by many factors outside of the Company’s control, including general economic conditions, consumer disposable income levels, consumer confidence levels, the availability, cost and level of consumer debt and consumer behaviors towards incurring and paying debt, the costs of basic necessities and other goods and the effects of the weather or natural disasters. Any decline in discretionary spending by consumers could negatively affect the Company's business and results of operations.The Company’s business is subject to unfavorable economic and political conditions and other developments and risks.Unfavorable global, domestic or regional economic or political conditions and other developments and risks could negatively affect the Company’s business and results of operations. For example, unfavorable changes related to interest rates, rates of economic growth, fiscal and monetary policies of governments, inflation, deflation, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, consumer debt payment behaviors, tax rates and policy, unemployment trends, energy prices, and other matters that influence the availability and cost of merchandise, consumer confidence, spending and tourism could negatively affect the Company’s business and results of operations. In addition, unstable political conditions, civil unrest, terrorist activities and armed conflicts may disrupt commerce and could negatively affect the Company’s business and results of operations.5The Company’s revenues and cash requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of its business.The Company’s business is seasonal, with a high proportion of revenues and operating cash flows generated during the second half of the fiscal year, which includes the fall and holiday selling seasons. A disproportionate amount of the Company's revenues fall in the fourth fiscal quarter, which coincides with the holiday season. In addition, the Company incurs significant additional expenses in the period leading up to the months of November and December in anticipation of higher sales volume in those periods, including for additional inventory, advertising and employees.The Company’s business could be affected by extreme weather conditions, regional or global health pandemics or natural disasters.Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which the Company’s stores are located could negatively affect the Company’s business and results of operations. For example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for the Company’s customers to travel to its stores and thereby reduce the Company’s sales and profitability. The Company’s business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could reduce demand for a portion of the Company’s inventory and thereby reduce the Company's sales and profitability. In addition, extreme weather conditions could result in disruption or delay of production and delivery of materials and products in the Company's supply chain and cause staffing shortages in the Company's stores.The Company's business and results of operations could also be negatively affected if a regional or global health pandemic were to occur, depending upon its location, duration and severity.

The Company cannot make any assurances that it would be able to obtain such an alternate source of funding on satisfactory terms, if at all, and its inability to do so could cause the holders of its securities to experience a partial or total loss of their investments in the Company.6Table of ContentsThe Company periodically reviews the carrying value of its goodwill for possible impairment; if future circumstances indicate that goodwill is impaired, the Company could be required to write down amounts of goodwill and record impairment charges.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company reduced the carrying value of its goodwill from $9,125 million to $3,743 million and recorded a related non-cash impairment charge of $5,382 million. The Company continues to monitor relevant circumstances, including consumer spending levels, general economic conditions and the market prices for the Company’s common stock, and the potential impact that such circumstances might have on the valuation of the Company’s goodwill. It is possible that changes in such circumstances, or in the numerous variables associated with the judgments, assumptions and estimates made by the Company in assessing the appropriate valuation of its goodwill, could in the future require the Company to further reduce its goodwill and record related non-cash impairment charges. If the Company were required to further reduce its goodwill and record related non-cash impairment charges, the Company’s financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected.The Company depends on its ability to attract and retain quality employees.The Company’s business is dependent upon attracting and retaining quality employees. The Company has a large number of employees, many of whom are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. The Company’s ability to meet its labor needs while controlling the costs associated with hiring and training new employees is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation and changing demographics. In addition, as a large and complex enterprise operating in a highly competitive and challenging business environment, the Company is highly dependent upon management personnel to develop and effectively execute successful business strategies and tactics.  Any circumstances that adversely impact the Company’s ability to attract, train, develop and retain quality employees throughout the organization could negatively affect the Company’s business and results of operations.The Company depends upon designers, vendors and other sources of merchandise, goods and services. The Company's business could be affected by disruptions in, or other legal, regulatory, political or economic issues associated with, our supply network.The Company’s relationships with established and emerging designers have been a significant contributor to the Company’s past success. The Company’s ability to find qualified vendors and access products in a timely and efficient manner is often challenging, particularly with respect to goods sourced outside the United States. The Company’s procurement of goods and services from outside the United States is subject to risks associated with political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to foreign trade, including costs and uncertainties associated with efforts to identify and disclose sources of ""conflict minerals"" used in products that the Company causes to be manufactured and potential sell-through difficulties and reputational damage that may be associated with the inability of the Company to determine that such products are ""DRC conflict-free."" In addition, the Company’s procurement of all its goods and services is subject to the effects of price increases which the Company may or may not be able to pass through to its customers. All of these factors may affect the Company’s ability to access suitable merchandise on acceptable terms, are beyond the Company’s control and could negatively affect the Company’s business and results of operations.The Company's sales and operating results could be adversely affected by product safety concerns.If the Company's merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our consumers' expectations regarding safety, the Company could experience decreased sales, experience increased costs and/or be exposed to legal and reputational risk. Events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose the Company to government enforcement action and/or private litigation. Reputational damage caused by real or perceived product safety concerns could negatively affect the Company's business and results of operations.The Company depends upon the success of its advertising and marketing programs.The Company’s advertising and promotional costs, net of cooperative advertising allowances, amounted to $1,166 million for 2013. The Company’s business depends on effective marketing and high customer traffic. The Company has many initiatives in this area, and often changes its advertising and marketing programs. There can be no assurance as to the Company’s continued ability to effectively execute its advertising and marketing programs, and any failure to do so could negatively affect the Company’s business and results of operations.7Table of ContentsParties with whom the Company does business may be subject to insolvency risks or may otherwise become unable or unwilling to perform their obligations to the Company.The Company is a party to contracts, transactions and business relationships with various third parties, including vendors, suppliers, service providers, lenders and participants in joint ventures, strategic alliances and other joint commercial relationships, pursuant to which such third parties have performance, payment and other obligations to the Company. In some cases, the Company depends upon such third parties to provide essential leaseholds, products, services or other benefits, including with respect to store and distribution center locations, merchandise, advertising, software development and support, logistics, other agreements for goods and services in order to operate the Company’s business in the ordinary course, extensions of credit, credit card accounts and related receivables, and other vital matters. Current economic, industry and market conditions could result in increased risks to the Company associated with the potential financial distress or insolvency of such third parties. If any of these third parties were to become subject to bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, the rights and benefits of the Company in relation to its contracts, transactions and business relationships with such third parties could be terminated, modified in a manner adverse to the Company, or otherwise impaired. The Company cannot make any assurances that it would be able to arrange for alternate or replacement contracts, transactions or business relationships on terms as favorable as the Company’s existing contracts, transactions or business relationships, if at all. Any inability on the part of the Company to do so could negatively affect the Company’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.A material disruption in the Company’s computer systems could adversely affect the Company’s business or results of operations.The Company relies extensively on its computer systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage its business. The Company’s computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber-attack or other security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, acts of war or terrorism, and usage errors by the Company’s employees. If the Company’s computer systems are damaged or cease to function properly, the Company may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them, and the Company may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in its operations. Any material interruption in the Company’s computer systems could negatively affect its business and results of operations.A privacy breach could result in negative publicity and adversely affect the Company’s business or results of operations.The protection of customer, employee, and company data is critical to the Company. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements across business units. In addition, customers have a high expectation that the Company will adequately protect their personal information from cyber-attack or other security breaches. A significant breach of customer, employee, or company data could attract a substantial amount of media attention, damage the Company’s customer relationships and reputation and result in lost sales, fines, or lawsuits.Litigation, legislation or regulatory developments could adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations.The Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations, inquiries and initiatives in connection with both its core business operations and its credit card and other ancillary operations (including the Credit Card Act of 2009 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”)). Recent and future developments relating to such matters could increase the Company's compliance costs and adversely affect the profitability of its credit card and other operations. The Company is also subject to anti-bribery, customs, child labor, truth-in-advertising and other laws, including consumer protection regulations and zoning and occupancy ordinances that regulate retailers generally and/or govern the importation, promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of retail stores and warehouse facilities. Although the Company undertakes to monitor changes in these laws, if these laws change without the Company's knowledge, or are violated by importers, designers, manufacturers, distributors or agents, the Company could experience delays in shipments and receipt of goods or be subject to fines or other penalties under the controlling regulations, any of which could negatively affect the Company's business and results of operations. In addition, the Company is regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of its business. Adverse outcomes in current or future litigation could negatively affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.8Table of ContentsFactors beyond the Company’s control could affect the Company’s stock price.The Company’s stock price, like that of other retail companies, is subject to significant volatility because of many factors, including factors beyond the control of the Company. These factors may include:•general economic and stock and credit market conditions;•risks relating to the Company’s business and its industry, including those discussed above;•strategic actions by the Company or its competitors;•variations in the Company’s quarterly results of operations;•future sales or purchases of the Company’s common stock; and•investor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with the Company’s common stock relative to other investment alternatives.In addition, the Company may fail to meet the expectations of its stockholders or of analysts at some time in the future. If the analysts that regularly follow the Company’s stock lower their rating or lower their projections for future growth and financial performance, the Company’s stock price could decline. Also, sales of a substantial number of shares of the Company’s common stock in the public market or the appearance that these shares are available for sale could adversely affect the market price of the Company’s common stock"

.In evaluating the Company, the risks described below and the matters described in “Forward-Looking Statements” should be considered carefully. Such risks and matters are numerous and diverse, may be experienced continuously or intermittently, and may vary in intensity and effect. Any of such risks and matters, individually or in combination, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as on the attractiveness and value of an investment in the Company's securities.The Company faces significant competition in the retail industry.The Company conducts its retail merchandising business under highly competitive conditions. Although the Company is one of the nation’s largest retailers, it has numerous and varied competitors at the national and local levels, including conventional and specialty department stores, other specialty stores, category killers, mass merchants, value retailers, discounters, and Internet and mail-order retailers. Competition may intensify as the Company’s competitors enter into business combinations or alliances. Competition is characterized by many factors, including assortment, advertising, price, quality, service, location, reputation and credit availability. Any failure by the Company to compete effectively could negatively affect the Company's business and results of operations.The Company’s sales and operating results depend on consumer preferences and consumer spending.The fashion and retail industries are subject to sudden shifts in consumer trends and consumer spending. The Company’s sales and operating results depend in part on its ability to predict or respond to changes in fashion trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner. The Company develops new retail concepts and continuously adjusts its industry position in certain major and private-label brands and product categories in an effort to satisfy customers. Any sustained failure to anticipate, identify and respond to emerging trends in lifestyle and consumer preferences could negatively affect the Company’s business and results of operations. The Company’s sales are significantly affected by discretionary spending by consumers. Consumer spending may be affected by many factors outside of the Company’s control, including general economic conditions, consumer disposable income levels, consumer confidence levels, the availability, cost and level of consumer debt and consumer behaviors towards incurring and paying debt, the costs of basic necessities and other goods and the effects of the weather or natural disasters. Any decline in discretionary spending by consumers could negatively affect the Company's business and results of operations.The Company’s business is subject to unfavorable economic and political conditions and other developments and risks.Unfavorable global, domestic or regional economic or political conditions and other developments and risks could negatively affect the Company’s business and results of operations. For example, unfavorable changes related to interest rates, rates of economic growth, fiscal and monetary policies of governments, inflation, deflation, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, consumer debt payment behaviors, tax rates and policy, unemployment trends, energy prices, and other matters that influence the availability and cost of merchandise, consumer confidence, spending and tourism could negatively affect the Company’s business and results of operations. In addition, unstable political conditions, civil unrest, terrorist activities and armed conflicts may disrupt commerce and could negatively affect the Company’s business and results of operations.The Company’s revenues and cash requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of its business.The Company’s business is seasonal, with a high proportion of revenues and operating cash flows generated during the second half of the fiscal year, which includes the fall and holiday selling seasons. A disproportionate amount of the Company's revenues fall in the fourth fiscal quarter, which coincides with the holiday season. In addition, the Company incurs significant additional expenses in the period leading up to the months of November and December in anticipation of higher sales volume in those periods, including for additional inventory, advertising and employees.The Company’s business could be affected by extreme weather conditions, regional or global health pandemics or natural disasters.Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which the Company’s stores are located could negatively affect the Company’s business and results of operations. For example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for the Company’s customers to travel to its stores and thereby reduce the Company’s sales and profitability. The Company’s business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could reduce demand for a portion of the Company’s inventory and thereby reduce the Company's sales and profitability. 5Table of ContentsThe Company's business and results of operations could also be negatively affected if a regional or global health pandemic were to occur, depending upon its location, duration and severity. To halt or delay the spread of disease, local, regional or national governments might limit or ban public gatherings or customers might avoid public places, such as the Company's stores. A regional or global health pandemic might also result in disruption or delay of production and delivery of materials and products in the Company's supply chain and cause staffing shortages in the Company's stores.In addition, natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes, or a combination of these or other factors, could damage or destroy the Company’s facilities or make it difficult for customers to travel to its stores, thereby negatively affecting the Company’s business and results of operations.The Company’s pension funding could increase at a higher than anticipated rate.Significant changes in interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets could affect the funded status of the Company’s plans and could increase future funding requirements of the pension plans. A significant increase in future funding requirements could have a negative impact on the Company’s cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.Increases in the cost of employee benefits could impact the Company’s financial results and cash flow.The Company’s expenses relating to employee health benefits are significant. Unfavorable changes in the cost of such benefits could negatively affect the Company’s financial results and cash flow. Healthcare costs have risen significantly in recent years, and recent legislative and private sector initiatives regarding healthcare reform could result in significant changes to the U.S. healthcare system. Due to the breadth and complexity of the healthcare reform legislation, the lack of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance and the phased-in nature of the implementation of the legislation, the Company is not able at this time to fully determine the impact that healthcare reform will have on the Company-sponsored medical plans.Inability to access capital markets could adversely affect the Company’s business or financial condition.Changes in the credit and capital markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations, may increase the cost of financing or restrict the Company’s access to this potential source of future liquidity. A decrease in the ratings that rating agencies assign to the Company’s short and long-term debt may negatively impact the Company’s access to the debt capital markets and increase the Company’s cost of borrowing. In addition, the Company’s bank credit agreements require the Company to maintain specified interest coverage and leverage ratios. The Company’s ability to comply with the ratios may be affected by events beyond its control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If the Company’s results of operations or operating ratios deteriorate to a point where the Company is not in compliance with its debt covenants, and the Company is unable to obtain a waiver, much of the Company’s debt would be in default and could become due and payable immediately. The Company’s assets may not be sufficient to repay in full this indebtedness, resulting in a need for an alternate source of funding.

In addition, the Company’s procurement of all its goods and services is subject to the effects of price increases which the Company may or may not be able to pass through to its customers. All of these factors may affect the Company’s ability to access suitable merchandise on acceptable terms, are beyond the Company’s control and could adversely impact the Company’s performance.The Company's sales and operating results could be adversely affected by product safety concerns.If the Company's merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our consumers' expectations regarding safety, the Company could experience decreased sales, experience increased costs and/or be exposed to legal and reputational risk. Events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose the Company to government enforcement action and/or private litigation. Reputational damage caused by real or perceived product safety concerns could have a negative impact on the Company's sales and operating results.The Company depends upon the success of its advertising and marketing programs.The Company’s advertising and promotional costs, net of cooperative advertising allowances, amounted to $1,136 million for 2011. The Company’s business depends on high customer traffic in its stores and effective marketing. The Company has many initiatives in this area, and often changes its advertising and marketing programs. There can be no assurance as to the Company’s continued ability to effectively execute its advertising and marketing programs, and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.Parties with whom the Company does business may be subject to insolvency risks or may otherwise become unable or unwilling to perform their obligations to the Company.The Company is a party to contracts, transactions and business relationships with various third parties, including vendors, 6Table of Contentssuppliers, service providers, lenders and participants in joint ventures, strategic alliances and other joint commercial relationships, pursuant to which such third parties have performance, payment and other obligations to the Company. In some cases, the Company depends upon such third parties to provide essential leaseholds, products, services or other benefits, including with respect to store and distribution center locations, merchandise, advertising, software development and support, logistics, other agreements for goods and services in order to operate the Company’s business in the ordinary course, extensions of credit, credit card accounts and related receivables, and other vital matters. Current economic, industry and market conditions could result in increased risks to the Company associated with the potential financial distress or insolvency of such third parties. If any of these third parties were to become subject to bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, the rights and benefits of the Company in relation to its contracts, transactions and business relationships with such third parties could be terminated, modified in a manner adverse to the Company, or otherwise impaired. The Company cannot make any assurances that it would be able to arrange for alternate or replacement contracts, transactions or business relationships on terms as favorable as the Company’s existing contracts, transactions or business relationships, if at all. Any inability on the part of the Company to do so could negatively affect the Company’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.A material disruption in the Company’s computer systems could adversely affect the Company’s business or results of operations.The Company relies extensively on its computer systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage its business. The Company’s computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber-attack or other security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, acts of war or terrorism, and usage errors by the Company’s employees. If the Company’s computer systems are damaged or cease to function properly, the Company may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them, and the Company may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in its operations in the interim. Any material interruption in the Company’s computer systems could adversely affect its business or results of operations.A privacy breach could result in negative publicity and adversely affect the Company’s business or results of operations.The protection of customer, employee, and company data is critical to the Company. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements across business units. In addition, customers have a high expectation that the Company will adequately protect their personal information from cyber-attack or other security breaches. A significant breach of customer, employee, or company data could attract a substantial amount of media attention, damage the Company’s customer relationships and reputation and result in lost sales, fines, or lawsuits.A regional or global health pandemic could severely affect the Company’s business.A health pandemic is a disease that spreads rapidly and widely by infection and affects many individuals in an area or population at the same time. If a regional or global health pandemic were to occur, depending upon its location, duration and severity, the Company’s business could be severely affected. Customers might avoid public places in the event of a health pandemic, and local, regional or national governments might limit or ban public gatherings to halt or delay the spread of disease. A regional or global health pandemic might also adversely impact the Company’s business by disrupting or delaying production and delivery of materials and products in its supply chain and by causing staffing shortages in its stores.The Company is subject to numerous regulations that could adversely affect its business.The Company is subject to customs, child labor, truth-in-advertising and other laws, including consumer protection regulations and zoning and occupancy ordinances that regulate retailers generally and/or govern the importation, promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of retail stores and warehouse facilities. Although the Company undertakes to monitor changes in these laws, if these laws change without the Company’s knowledge, or are violated by importers, designers, manufacturers or distributors, the Company could experience delays in shipments and receipt of goods or be subject to fines or other penalties under the controlling regulations, any of which could adversely affect the Company’s business.Litigation, legislation or regulatory developments could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.The Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations, inquiries and initiatives in connection with both its core business operations and its credit card and other ancillary operations (including the Credit Card Act of 2009 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”)). Recent and future developments relating to such matters could increase the Company's compliance costs and adversely affect the profitability of its credit card and other operations.  In addition, the Company is regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise in the 7Table of Contentsordinary course of its business. Adverse outcomes in current or future litigation could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Factors beyond the Company’s control could affect the Company’s stock price.The Company’s stock price, like that of other retail companies, is subject to significant volatility because of many factors, including factors beyond the control of the Company. These factors may include:•general economic and stock and credit market conditions;•risks relating to the Company’s business and its industry, including those discussed above;•strategic actions by the Company or its competitors;•variations in the Company’s quarterly results of operations;•future sales or purchases of the Company’s common stock; and•investor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with the Company’s common stock relative to other investment alternatives.In addition, the Company may fail to meet the expectations of its stockholders or of analysts at some time in the future. If the analysts that regularly follow the Company’s stock lower their rating or lower their projections for future growth and financial performance, the Company’s stock price could decline. Also, sales of a substantial number of shares of the Company’s common stock in the public market or the appearance that these shares are available for sale could adversely affect the market price of the Company’s common stock"

.  Inevaluating the Company, the risks described below and the matters described in Forward-Looking Statements should be considered carefully. Such risks and matters could significantly and adversely affect the Companys business,prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.   6 Table of ContentsThe Company faces significant competition in the retail industry. The Company conducts its retail merchandising business under highly competitive conditions. Although the Company is one of thenations largest retailers, it has numerous and varied competitors at the national and local levels, including conventional and specialty department stores, other specialty stores, category killers, mass merchants, value retailers, discounters,and Internet and mail-order retailers. Competition may intensify as the Companys competitors enter into business combinations or alliances. Competition is characterized by many factors, including assortment, advertising, price, quality,service, location, reputation and credit availability. If the Company does not compete effectively with regard to these factors, its results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The Companys sales and operating results depend on consumer preferences and consumer spending. The fashion and retail industries are subject to sudden shifts in consumer trends and consumer spending. The Companys sales andoperating results depend in part on its ability to predict or respond to changes in fashion trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner. The Company develops new retail concepts and continuously adjusts its industry position in certain majorand private-label brands and product categories in an effort to satisfy customers. Any sustained failure to anticipate, identify and respond to emerging trends in lifestyle and consumer preferences could have a material adverse effect on theCompanys business. The Companys sales are impacted by discretionary spending by consumers. Consumer spending may be affected by many factors outside of the Companys control, including general economic conditions, consumerdisposable income levels, consumer confidence levels, the availability, cost and level of consumer debt and customer behaviors towards incurring and paying debt, the costs of basic necessities and other goods and the effects of the weather ornatural disasters.  The Companys business is subject to unfavorable economic and political conditions and other developments andrisks.  Unfavorable global, domestic or regional economic or political conditions and other developments and risks couldnegatively affect the Companys business. For example, unfavorable changes related to interest rates, rates of economic growth, fiscal and monetary policies of governments, inflation, deflation, consumer credit availability, consumer debtlevels, consumer debt payment behaviors, tax rates and policy, unemployment trends, oil prices, and other matters that influence the availability and cost of merchandise, consumer confidence, spending and tourism could adversely impact theCompanys business and results of operations. In addition, unstable political conditions or civil unrest, including terrorist activities and worldwide military and domestic disturbances and conflicts, may disrupt commerce and could have amaterial adverse effect on the Companys business and results of operations.  The Companys revenues and cash requirements areaffected by the seasonal nature of its business.  The Companys business is seasonal, with a high proportion ofrevenues and operating cash flows generated during the second half of the fiscal year, which includes the fall and holiday selling seasons. A disproportionate amount of revenues fall in the fourth fiscal quarter, which coincides with the holidayseason. In addition, the Company incurs significant additional expenses in the period leading up to the months of November and December in anticipation of higher sales volume in those periods, including for additional inventory, advertising andemployees.  The Companys business could be affected by extreme weather conditions or natural disasters. Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which the Companys stores are located could adversely affect the Companys business.For example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for the Companys customers to  7 Table of Contentstravel to its stores and thereby reduce the Companys sales and profitability. The Companys business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions. For example, extendedperiods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could render a portion of the Companys inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions. Reduced sales from extreme orprolonged unseasonable weather conditions could adversely affect the Companys business.  In addition, natural disasterssuch as hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes, or a combination of these or other factors, could severely damage or destroy one or more of the Companys stores or warehouses located in the affected areas, thereby disrupting the Companysbusiness operations.  The Companys pension costs could increase at a higher than anticipated rate. Significant changes in interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets could affect thefunded status of the Companys plans and could increase future funding requirements of the pension plans. A significant increase in future funding requirements could have a negative impact on the Companys cash flows, financial conditionor results of operations.  Increases in the cost of employee benefits could impact the Companys financial results and cash flow. The Companys expenses relating to employee health benefits are significant. Unfavorable changes in the cost of suchbenefits could impact the Companys financial results and cash flow. Healthcare costs have risen significantly in recent years, and recent legislative and private sector initiatives regarding healthcare reform could result in significantchanges to the U.S. healthcare system. The Company is not able at this time to determine the impact that healthcare reform could have on the Company-sponsored medical plans.  Inability to access capital markets could adversely affect the Companys business or financial condition.  Changes in the credit and capital markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations, may increase the cost of financing or restrict the Companys access to thispotential source of future liquidity. A decrease in the ratings that rating agencies assign to the Companys short and long-term debt may negatively impact the Companys access to the debt capital markets and increase the Companyscost of borrowing. In addition, the Companys bank credit agreements require the Company to maintain specified interest coverage and leverage ratios. The Companys ability to comply with the ratios may be affected by events beyond itscontrol, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If the Companys results of operations or operating ratios deteriorate to a point where the Company is not in compliance with its debt covenants, and the Company isunable to obtain a waiver, much of the Companys debt would be in default and could become due and payable immediately. The Companys assets may not be sufficient to repay in full this indebtedness, resulting in a need for an alternatesource of funding. The Company cannot make any assurances that it would be able to obtain such an alternate source of funding on satisfactory terms, if at all, and its inability to do so could cause the holders of its securities to experience apartial or total loss of their investments in the Company.  The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of its goodwill forpossible impairment; if future circumstances indicate that goodwill is impaired, the Company could be required to write down amounts of goodwill and record impairment charges. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company reduced the carrying value of its goodwill from $9,125 million to $3,743 million andrecorded a related non-cash impairment charge of $5,382 million. The Company continues to monitor relevant circumstances, including consumer spending levels, general economic conditions and the market prices for the Companys common stock, andthe potential impact that such circumstances might have on the valuation of the Companys goodwill. It is possible that changes in such circumstances, or in the numerous variables associated with the judgments, assumptions and estimates made bythe Company in assessing   8 Table of Contentsthe appropriate valuation of its goodwill, could in the future require the Company to further reduce its goodwill and record related non-cash impairment charges. If the Company were required tofurther reduce its goodwill and record related non-cash impairment charges, the Companys financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected.  The Company depends on its ability to attract and retain quality employees. The Companys business is dependent upon attracting and retaining a large number of quality employees. Many of these employees are inentry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. The Companys ability to meet its labor needs while controlling the costs associated with hiring and training new employees is subject to external factors such asunemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation and changing demographics. Changes that adversely impact the Companys ability to attract and retain quality employees could adversely affect the Companys business. The Company depends upon designers, vendors and other sources of merchandise, goods and services. The Companys relationships with established and emerging designers have been a significant contributor to the Companys pastsuccess. The Companys ability to find qualified vendors and access products in a timely and efficient manner is often challenging, particularly with respect to goods sourced outside the United States. The Companys procurement of goodsand services from outside the United States is subject to risks associated with political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to foreign trade. Inaddition, the Companys procurement of all its goods and services is subject to the effects of price increases which the Company may or may not be able to pass through to its customers. All of these factors may affect the Companys abilityto access suitable merchandise on acceptable terms, are beyond the Companys control and could adversely impact the Companys performance.  The Company depends upon the success of its advertising and marketing programs.  The Companys advertising and promotional costs, net of cooperative advertising allowances, amounted to $1,072 million for 2010. The Companys business depends on high customer traffic in itsstores and effective marketing. The Company has many initiatives in this area, and often changes its advertising and marketing programs. There can be no assurance as to the Companys continued ability to effectively execute its advertising andmarketing programs, and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business and results of operations. The benefits expected to be realized from the expansion of the Companys market localization initiatives and the changes to its operatingstructure are subject to various risks.  The Companys success in fully realizing the anticipated benefits from theexpansion of its market localization initiatives and the changes to its operating structure will depend in large part on achieving anticipated cost savings, business opportunities and growth prospects. The Companys ability to benefit fromexpanded market localization initiatives and the changes to its operating structure is subject to both the risks affecting the Companys business generally and the inherent difficulties associated with implementing these initiatives. Thefailure of the Company to fully realize the benefits expected to result from these initiatives could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business and results of operations.  Parties with whom the Company does business may be subject to insolvency risks or may otherwise become unable or unwilling to perform their obligations to the Company. The Company is a party to contracts, transactions and business relationships with various third parties, including vendors, suppliers,service providers, lenders and participants in joint ventures, strategic alliances and other joint commercial relationships, pursuant to which such third parties have performance, payment and other  9 Table of Contentsobligations to the Company.

The Companycannot assure you that it would be able to arrange for alternate or replacement contracts, transactions or business relationships on terms as favorable as the Companys existing contracts, transactions or business relationships, if at all. Anyinability on the part of the Company to do so could negatively affect the Companys cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.  A material disruption in the Companys computer systems could adversely affect the Companys business or results of operations.  The Company relies extensively on its computer systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage its business. The Companys computer systems are subject to damage or interruption frompower outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, acts of war or terrorism, and usage errors by the Companys employees.If the Companys computer systems are damaged or cease to function properly, the Company may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them, and the Company may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in itsoperations in the interim. Any material interruption in the Companys computer systems could adversely affect its business or results of operations.  A privacy breach could result in negative publicity and adversely affect the Companys business.  The protection of customer, employee, and company data is critical to the Company. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequentimposition of new and constantly changing requirements across business units. In addition, customers have a high expectation that the Company will adequately protect their personal information. A significant breach of customer, employee, or companydata could attract a substantial amount of media attention, damage the Companys customer relationships and reputation and result in lost sales, fines, or lawsuits.  A regional or global health pandemic could severely affect the Companys business.  A health pandemic is a disease that spreads rapidly and widely by infection and affects many individuals in an area or population at the same time. If a regional or global health pandemic were to occur,depending upon its location, duration and severity, the Companys business could be severely affected. Customers might avoid public places in the event of a health pandemic, and local, regional or national governments might limit or ban publicgatherings to halt or delay the spread of disease. A regional or global health pandemic might also adversely impact the Companys business by disrupting or delaying production and delivery of materials and products in its supply chain and bycausing staffing shortages in its stores.  The Company is subject to numerous regulations that could adversely affect its business.  The Company is subject to customs, child labor, truth-in-advertising and other laws, including consumer protection regulationsand zoning and occupancy ordinances that regulate retailers generally and/or govern the importation, promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of retail stores and warehouse facilities. Although the Company undertakes to monitor changes inthese laws, if these laws change without the Companys knowledge, or are violated by importers, designers, manufacturers or distributors, the Company could experience delays in shipments and receipt of goods or be subject to fines or otherpenalties under the controlling regulations, any of which could adversely affect the Companys business.   10 Litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect the Companys business or financialcondition.  The Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and initiatives, includinglaws and regulations with respect to the credit card industry (including the Credit Card Act of 2009), which may change from time to time. In addition, the Company is regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise in the ordinary courseof its business. Litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect the Companys business and financial condition.  Factorsbeyond the Companys control could affect the Companys stock price.  The Companys stock price, like thatof other retail companies, is subject to significant volatility because of many factors, including factors beyond the control of the Company. These factors may include:      general economic and stock and credit market conditions;      risks relating to the Companys business and its industry, including those discussed above;      strategic actions by the Company or its competitors;      variations in the Companys quarterly results of operations;      future sales or purchases of the Companys common stock; and      investor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with the Companys common stock relative to other investment alternatives. In addition, the Company may fail to meet the expectations of its stockholders or of analysts at some timein the future. If the analysts that regularly follow the Companys stock lower their rating or lower their projections for future growth and financial performance, the Companys stock price could decline. Also, sales of a substantialnumber of shares of the Companys common stock in the public market or the appearance that these shares are available for sale could adversely affect the market price of the Companys common stock.   "
2,M,MACY'S INC,2009-04-01,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
.  In evaluating the Company, the risksdescribed below and the matters described in Forward-Looking Statements should be considered carefully. Such risks and matters could significantly and adversely affect the Companys business, prospects, financial condition, resultsof operations and cash flows.  The Company faces significant competition in the retail industry.  The Company conducts its retail merchandising business under highly competitive conditions. Although the Company is one of the nations largestretailers, it has numerous and varied competitors at the national and local levels, including conventional and specialty department stores, other specialty stores, category killers, mass merchants, value retailers, discounters, and Internet andmail-order retailers. Competition may intensify as the Companys competitors enter into business combinations or alliances. Competition is characterized by many factors, including assortment, advertising, price, quality, service, location,reputation and credit availability. If the Company does not compete effectively with regard to these factors, its results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.  The Companys sales and operating results depend on consumer preferences and consumer spending.  The fashion and retail industries are subject to sudden shifts in consumer trends and consumer spending. The Companys sales and operating results depend in part on its ability to predict or respond to changes in fashion trends andconsumer preferences in a timely manner. The Company develops new retail concepts and continuously adjusts its industry position in certain major and private-label brands and product categories in an effort to satisfy customers. Any sustainedfailure to anticipate, identify and respond to emerging trends in lifestyle and consumer preferences could have a material adverse affect on the Companys business. The Companys sales are impacted by discretionary spending by consumers.Consumer spending may be affected by many factors outside of the Companys control, including general economic conditions, consumer disposable income levels, consumer confidence levels, the availability, cost and level of consumer debt, thecosts of basic necessities and other goods and the effects of the weather or natural disasters.  The Companys business is subject to unfavorableeconomic and political conditions and other developments and risks.  Unfavorable global, domestic or regional economic or politicalconditions and other developments and risks could negatively affect the Companys business. For example, unfavorable changes related to interest rates, rates of economic growth, fiscal and monetary policies of governments, inflation, deflation,consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, tax rates and policy, unemployment trends, oil prices, and other matters that influence the availability and cost of merchandise, consumer confidence, spending and tourism could adversely impactthe Companys business and results of operations. In addition, unstable political conditions or civil unrest, including terrorist activities and worldwide military and domestic disturbances and conflicts, may disrupt commerce and could have amaterial adverse effect on the Companys business and results of operations.  The Companys revenues and cash requirements are affected by theseasonal nature of its business.  The Companys business is seasonal, with a high proportion of revenues and operating cash flowsgenerated during the second half of the fiscal year, which includes the fall and holiday selling seasons. A disproportionate   7 amount of revenues fall in the fourth fiscal quarter, which coincides with the holiday season. In addition, the Company incurs significant additionalexpenses in the period leading up to the months of November and December in anticipation of higher sales volume in those periods, including for additional inventory, advertising and employees.  The Companys business could be affected by extreme weather conditions or natural disasters.  Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which the Companys stores are located could adversely affect the Companys business. For example,frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for the Companys customers to travel to its stores and thereby reduce the Companys sales andprofitability. The Companys business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could render aportion of the Companys inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions. Reduced sales from extreme or prolonged unseasonable weather conditions could adversely affect the Companys business.  In addition, natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes, or a combination of these or other factors, could severely damage ordestroy one or more of the Companys stores or warehouses located in the affected areas, thereby disrupting the Companys business operations.  The Companys pension costs could increase at a higher than anticipated rate.  Significant changes in interest rates,decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets could affect the funded status of the Companys plans and could increase future funding requirements of the pension plans. A significant increase in future fundingrequirements could have a negative impact on the Companys cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.  Inability to access capitalmarkets may adversely affect the Companys business or financial condition.  Changes in the credit and capital markets, includingmarket disruptions, limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations, may increase the cost of financing or restrict the Companys access to this potential source of future liquidity. A decrease in the ratings that rating agencies assign to theCompanys short and long-term debt may negatively impact the Companys access to the debt capital markets and increase the Companys cost of borrowing. In addition, the Companys bank credit agreements require the Company tomaintain specified interest coverage and leverage ratios. The Companys ability to comply with the ratios may be affected by events beyond its control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If the Companysresults of operations or operating ratios deteriorate to a point where the Company is not in compliance with its debt covenants, and the Company is unable to obtain a waiver, much of the Companys debt would be in default and could become dueand payable immediately. The Companys assets may not be sufficient to repay in full this indebtedness, resulting in a need for an alternate source of funding. The Company cannot assure you that it would be able to obtain such an alternatesource of funding on satisfactory terms, if at all, and its inability to do so could cause the holders of its securities to experience a partial or total loss of their investments in the Company.  The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of its goodwill for possible impairment; if future circumstances indicate that goodwill is impaired, the Companycould be required to write down amounts of goodwill and record impairment charges.  In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Companyreduced the carrying value of its goodwill from $9,125 million to $3,743 million and recorded a related non-cash impairment charge of $5,382 million. The Company continues to monitor relevant circumstances, including consumer spending levels,general economic conditions and the market prices for the Companys common stock, and the potential impact that such circumstances might   8 have on the valuation of the Companys goodwill. It is possible that changes in such circumstances, or in the numerous variables associated with thejudgments, assumptions and estimates made by the Company in assessing the appropriate valuation of its goodwill, could in the future require the Company to further reduce its goodwill and record related non-cash impairment charges. If the Companywere required to further reduce its goodwill and record related non-cash impairment charges, the Companys financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected.  The Company depends on its ability to attract and retain quality employees.  The Companysbusiness is dependent upon attracting and retaining a large number of quality employees. Many of these employees are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. The Companys ability to meet its labor needswhile controlling the costs associated with hiring and training new employees is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation and changing demographics. Changes that adversely impact theCompanys ability to attract and retain quality employees could adversely affect the Companys business.  The Company depends upon itsrelationships with designers, vendors and other sources of merchandise.  The Companys relationships with established and emergingdesigners have been a significant contributor to the Companys past success. The Companys ability to find qualified vendors and access products in a timely and efficient manner is often challenging, particularly with respect to goodssourced outside the United States. Political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to foreign trade, each of which affects the Companys abilityto access suitable merchandise on acceptable terms, are beyond the Companys control and could adversely impact the Companys performance.  The Company depends upon the success of its advertising and marketing programs.  The Companys advertising andpromotional costs, net of cooperative advertising allowances, amounted to $1,239 million for 2008. The Companys business depends on high customer traffic in its stores and effective marketing. The Company has many initiatives in this area, andoften changes its advertising and marketing programs. There can be no assurance as to the Companys continued ability to effectively execute its advertising and marketing programs, and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effecton the Companys business and results of operations.  The benefits expected to be realized from the expansion of the Companys marketlocalization initiatives and the changes to its operating structure are subject to various risks, and the Companys failure to complete these initiatives successfully or on a timely basis could reduce the Companys profitability. The Companys success in fully realizing the anticipated benefits from the expansion of its market localization initiatives andthe changes to its operating structure will depend in large part on achieving anticipated cost savings, business opportunities and growth prospects. There can be no assurance that anticipated cost savings, business opportunities and growth prospectswill materialize. The Companys ability to benefit from expanded market localization initiatives and the changes to its operating structure is subject to both the risks affecting the Companys business generally and the inherentdifficulties associated with implementing these initiatives. The failure of the Company to realize the benefits expected to result from these initiatives could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business and results of operations. Parties with whom the Company does business may be subject to insolvency risks or may otherwise become unable or unwilling to perform their obligationsto the Company.  The Company is a party to contracts, transactions and business relationships with various third parties, includingvendors, suppliers, service providers, lenders and participants in joint ventures, strategic alliances and   9 other joint commercial relationships, pursuant to which such third parties have performance, payment and other obligations to the Company. In some cases, theCompany depends upon such third parties to provide essential leaseholds, products, services or other benefits, including with respect to store and distribution center locations, merchandise, advertising, software development and support, logistics,other agreements for goods and services in order to operate the Companys business in the ordinary course, extensions of credit, credit card accounts and related receivables, and other vital matters. Current economic, industry and marketconditions could result in increased risks to the Company associated with the potential financial distress or insolvency of such third parties. If any of these third parties were to become subject to bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings,the rights and benefits of the Company in relation to its contracts, transactions and business relationships with such third parties could be terminated, modified in a manner adverse to the Company, or otherwise impaired. The Company cannot assureyou that it would be able to arrange for alternate or replacement contracts, transactions or business relationships on terms as favorable as the Companys existing contracts, transactions or business relationships, if at all. Any inability onthe part of the Company to do so could negatively affect the Companys cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.  A materialdisruption in the Companys computer systems could adversely affect the Companys business or results of operations.  TheCompany relies extensively on its computer systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage its business. The Companys computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunicationsfailures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, acts of war or terrorism, and usage errors by the Companys employees. If the Companys computer systems aredamaged or cease to function properly, the Company may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them, and the Company may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in its operations in the interim. Any materialinterruption in the Companys computer systems could adversely affect its business or results of operations.

The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements across business units. In addition, customers have a highexpectation that the Company will adequately protect their personal information. A significant breach of customer, employee, or company data could attract a substantial amount of media attention, damage the Companys customer relationships andreputation and result in lost sales, fines, or lawsuits.  A regional or global health pandemic could severely affect the Companys business.

Any sustained failure to anticipate, identify    and respond to emerging trends in lifestyle and consumer    preferences could have a material adverse affect on the    Companys business. Consumer spending may be affected by    many factors outside of the Companys control, including    employment levels, consumer confidence, consumers    disposable income, the availability and cost of credit and other    general economic conditions. The    Companys business is subject to unfavorable economic and    political conditions and other developments and risks.     Unfavorable global, domestic or regional economic or political    conditions and other developments and risks could negatively    affect the Companys business.

There can    be no assurance as to the Companys continued ability to    effectively execute its advertising and marketing programs, and    any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the    Companys business and results of operations.     8 The    benefits expected to be realized from the division    consolidations and market localization initiatives are subject    to various risks, and the Companys failure to complete the    division consolidations and market localization initiatives    successfully or on a timely basis could reduce the    Companys profitability.     The Companys success in fully realizing the anticipated    benefits from the division consolidations and market    localization initiatives will depend in large part on achieving    anticipated cost savings, business opportunities and growth    prospects. There can be no assurance that anticipated cost    savings, business opportunities and growth prospects will    materialize. The Companys ability to benefit from the    division consolidations and market localization initiatives is    subject to both the risks affecting the Companys business    generally and the inherent difficulties associated with the    division consolidations and implementing the market localization    initiatives. The failure of the Company to realize the benefits    expected to result from the division consolidations and market    localization initiatives could have a material adverse effect on    the Companys business and results of operations. A    material disruption in the Companys computer systems could    adversely affect the Companys business or results of    operations.     The Company relies extensively on its computer systems to    process transactions, summarize results and manage its business.    The Companys computer systems are subject to damage or    interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications    failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic    events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes,    hurricanes, acts of war or terrorism, and usage errors by the    Companys employees. If the Companys computer systems    are damaged or cease to function properly, the Company may have    to make a significant investment to fix or replace them, and the    Company may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or    delays in its operations in the interim. Any material    interruption in the Companys computer systems could    adversely affect its business or results of operations. A privacy    breach could adversely affect the Companys    business.     The protection of customer, employee, and company data is    critical to the Company. The regulatory environment surrounding    information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with    the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing    requirements across business units. In addition, customers have    a high expectation that the Company will adequately protect    their personal information. A significant breach of customer,    employee, or company data could damage the Companys    reputation and result in lost sales, fines, or lawsuits. A    regional or global health pandemic could severely affect the    Companys business.     A health pandemic is a disease that spreads rapidly and widely    by infection and affects many individuals in an area or    population at the same time. If a regional or global health    pandemic were to occur, depending upon its location, duration    and severity, the Companys business could be severely    affected. Customers might avoid public places in the event of a    health pandemic, and local, regional or national governments    might limit or ban public gatherings to halt or delay the spread    of disease. A regional or global health pandemic might also    adversely impact the Companys business by disrupting or    delaying production and delivery of materials and products in    its supply chain and by causing staffing shortages in its stores.     9 The    Company is subject to numerous regulations that could adversely    affect its business.     The Company is subject to customs, child labor,    truth-in-advertising    and other laws, including consumer protection regulations and    zoning and occupancy ordinances that regulate retailers    generally    and/or    govern the importation, promotion and sale of merchandise and    the operation of retail stores and warehouse facilities.    Although the Company undertakes to monitor changes in these    laws, if these laws change without the Companys knowledge,    or are violated by importers, designers, manufacturers or    distributors, the Company could experience delays in shipments    and receipt of goods or be subject to fines or other penalties    under the controlling regulations, any of which could adversely    affect the Companys business. Litigation    or regulatory developments could adversely affect the    Companys business or financial condition.     The Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws,    rules and regulations, which may change from time to time. In    addition, the Company is regularly involved in various    litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of its    business. Litigation or regulatory developments could adversely    affect the Companys business and financial condition. Factors    beyond the Companys control could affect the    Companys stock price.     The Companys stock price, like that of other retail    companies, is subject to significant volatility because of many    factors, including factors beyond the control of the Company.    These factors may include:           general economic and stock market conditions;           risks relating to the Companys business and its industry,    including those discussed above;           strategic actions by the Company or its competitors;           variations in the Companys quarterly results of operations;           future sales or purchases of the Companys common    stock; and           investor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated    with the Companys common stock relative to other    investment alternatives.     In addition, the Company may fail to meet the expectations of    its stockholders or of analysts at some time in the future. If    the analysts that regularly follow the Companys stock    lower their rating or lower their projections for future growth    and financial performance, the Companys stock price could    decline. Also, sales of a substantial number of shares of the    Companys common stock in the public market or the    appearance that these shares are available for sale could    adversely affect the market price of the Companys common    stock. "
6,M,MACY'S INC,2007-04-04,">Item 1A.     Risk    Factors.     In evaluating the Company, the risks described below and the    matters described in Forward-Looking Statements    should be considered carefully. Such risks and matters could    significantly and adversely affect the Companys business,    prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash    flows. The    Company faces significant competition in the retail    industry.     The Company conducts its retail merchandising business under    highly competitive conditions. Although the Company is one of    the nations largest retailers, it has numerous and varied    competitors at the national and local levels, including    conventional and specialty department stores, other specialty    stores, category killers, mass merchants, value retailers,    discounters, and Internet and mail-order retailers. Competition    may intensify as the Companys competitors enter into    business combinations or alliances. Competition is characterized    by many factors, including assortment, advertising, price,    quality, service, location, reputation and credit availability.    If the Company does not compete effectively with regard to these    factors, its results of operations could be materially and    adversely affected. The    Companys sales and operating results depend on consumer    preferences and consumer spending.     The fashion and retail industries are subject to sudden shifts    in consumer trends and consumer spending. The Companys    sales and operating results depend in part on its ability to    predict or respond to changes in fashion trends and consumer    preferences in a timely manner. The Company develops new retail    concepts and continuously adjusts its industry position in    certain major and private-label brands and product categories in    an effort to satisfy customers. Any sustained failure to    anticipate, identify and respond to emerging trends in lifestyle    and consumer preferences could have a material adverse affect on    the Companys business. Consumer spending may be affected    by many factors outside of the Companys control, including    competition from    6Table of Contents    store-based retailers, mail-order and Internet companies,    consumer confidence and preferences, consumers disposable    income, weather that affects consumer traffic and general    economic conditions. A privacy    breach could adversely affect the Companys    business.     The protection of customer, employee, and company data is    critical to the Company. The regulatory environment surrounding    information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with    the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing    requirements across business units. In addition, customers have    a high expectation that the Company will adequately protect    their personal information. A significant breach of customer,    employee, or company data could damage the Companys    reputation and result in lost sales, fines, or lawsuits. The    Company depends upon its relationships with designers, vendors    and other sources of merchandise.     The Companys relationships with established and emerging    designers have been a significant contributor to the    Companys past success. The Companys ability to find    qualified vendors and access products in a timely and efficient    manner is often challenging, particularly with respect to goods    sourced outside the United States. Political or financial    instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange    rates, transport capacity and costs and other factors relating    to foreign trade, each of which affects the Companys    ability to access suitable merchandise on acceptable terms, are    beyond the Companys control and could adversely impact the    Companys performance. The    Companys business could be affected by extreme weather    conditions or natural disasters.     Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which the    Companys stores are located could adversely affect the    Companys business. For example, frequent or unusually    heavy snowfall, ice storms, rain storms or other extreme weather    conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for    the Companys customers to travel to its stores and thereby    reduce the Companys sales and profitability. The    Companys business is also susceptible to unseasonable    weather conditions. For example, extended periods of    unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool    weather during the summer season could render a portion of the    Companys inventory incompatible with those unseasonable    conditions. Reduced sales from extreme or prolonged unseasonable    weather conditions could adversely affect the Companys    business.     In addition, natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes and    earthquakes, or a combination of these or other factors, could    severely damage or destroy one or more of the Companys    stores or warehouses located in the affected areas, thereby    disrupting the Companys business operations. A    regional or global health pandemic could severely affect the    Companys business.     A health pandemic is a disease that spreads rapidly and widely    by infection and affects many individuals in an area or    population at the same time. If a regional or global health    pandemic were to occur, depending upon its location, duration    and severity, the Companys business could be severely    affected. Customers might avoid public places in the event of a    health pandemic, and local, regional or national governments    might limit or ban public gatherings to halt or delay the spread    of disease. A regional or global health pandemic might also    adversely impact the Companys business by disrupting or    delaying production and delivery of materials and products in    its supply chain and by causing staffing shortages in its stores.    7Table of Contents The    Companys revenues and cash requirements are affected by    the seasonal nature of its business.     The Companys business is seasonal, with a high proportion    of revenues and operating cash flows generated during the second    half of the fiscal year, which includes the fall and holiday    selling seasons. The Company has in the past experienced    significant fluctuations in its revenues from quarter to quarter    with a disproportionate amount of revenues falling in the fourth    fiscal quarter, which coincides with the holiday season. In    addition, the Company incurs significant additional expenses in    the period leading up to the months of November and December in    anticipation of higher sales volume in those periods, including    for additional inventory, advertising and employees. The    Companys business is subject to unfavorable economic and    political conditions and other developments and risks.     Unfavorable global, domestic or regional economic or political    conditions and other developments and risks could negatively    affect the Companys business. For example, unfavorable    changes related to interest rates, rates of economic growth,    fiscal and monetary policies of governments, inflation,    deflation, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels,    tax rates and policy, unemployment trends, oil prices, and other    matters that influence the availability and cost of merchandise,    consumer confidence, spending and tourism could adversely impact    the Companys business and results of operations. In    addition, unstable political conditions or civil unrest,    including terrorist activities and worldwide military and    domestic disturbances and conflicts, may disrupt commerce and    could have a material adverse effect on the Companys    business and results of operations. The    Companys growth may strain operations, which could    adversely affect the Companys business and financial    performance.     With the acquisition of May, the Companys business has    grown dramatically. Accordingly, sales, number of stores and    number of associates have grown and likely will continue to    grow. This growth places significant demands on management and    operational systems. If the Company is unable to effectively    manage its growth, operational inefficiencies could occur and,    as a result, the Companys business and results of    operations could be materially and adversely affected. The    Company depends upon the success of its advertising and    marketing programs.     The Companys advertising and promotional costs, net of    cooperative advertising allowances, amounted to    $1,171 million for 2006. The Companys business    depends on high customer traffic in its stores and effective    marketing. The Company has many initiatives in this area, and    often changes its advertising and marketing programs. There can    be no assurance as to the Companys continued ability to    effectively execute its advertising and marketing programs, and    any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the    Companys business and results of operations. A    material disruption in the Companys computer systems could    adversely affect the Companys business or results of    operations.     The Company relies extensively on its computer systems to    process transactions, summarize results and manage its business.    The Companys computer systems are subject to damage or    interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications    failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic    events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes,    hurricanes, acts of war or terrorism, and usage errors by the    8Table of Contents    Companys employees. If the Companys computer systems    are damaged or cease to function properly, the Company may have    to make a significant investment to fix or replace them, and the    Company may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or    delays in its operations in the interim. Any material    interruption in the Companys computer systems could    adversely affect its business or results of operations. If the    Company is unable to attract and retain quality employees, its    business could be adversely affected.     The Companys business is dependent upon attracting and    retaining a large and growing number of quality employees. Many    of these employees are in entry level or part-time positions    with historically high rates of turnover. The Companys    ability to meet its labor needs while controlling the costs    associated with hiring and training new employees is subject to    external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage    rates, minimum wage legislation and changing demographics.    Changes that adversely impact the Companys ability to    attract and retain quality employees could adversely affect the    Companys business. The    Company is subject to numerous regulations that could adversely    affect its business.     The Company is subject to customs,    truth-in-advertising    and other laws, including consumer protection regulations and    zoning and occupancy ordinances that regulate retailers    generally    and/or    govern the importation, promotion and sale of merchandise and    the operation of retail stores and warehouse facilities.    Although the Company undertakes to monitor changes in these    laws, if these laws change without the Companys knowledge,    or are violated by importers, designers, manufacturers or    distributors, the Company could experience delays in shipments    and receipt of goods or be subject to fines or other penalties    under the controlling regulations, any of which could adversely    affect the Companys business. Litigation    or regulatory developments could adversely affect the    Companys business or financial condition.     The Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws,    rules and regulations, which may change from time to time. In    addition, the Company is regularly involved in various    litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of its    business. Litigation or regulatory developments could adversely    affect the Companys business and financial condition. Factors    beyond the Companys control could affect the    Companys stock price.     The Companys stock price, like that of other retail    companies, is subject to significant volatility because of many    factors, including factors beyond the control of the Company.    These factors may include:           general economic and stock market conditions;           risks relating to the Companys business and its industry,    including those discussed above;           strategic actions by the Company or its competitors;           variations in the Companys quarterly results of operations;           future sales or purchases of the Companys common    stock; and           investor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated    with the Companys common stock relative to other    investment alternatives.     In addition, the Company may fail to meet the expectations of    its stockholders or of analysts at some time in the future. If    the analysts that regularly follow the Companys stock    lower their rating or lower their    9Table of Contents    projections for future growth and financial performance, the    Companys stock price could decline. Also, sales of a    substantial number of shares of the Companys common stock    in the public market or the appearance that these shares are    available for sale could adversely affect the market price of    the Companys common stock. "

TheCompanys success in fully realizing the anticipatedbenefits from the acquisition will depend in large part onachieving anticipated synergies, business opportunities andgrowth prospects. There can be no assurance that thesesynergies, business opportunities and growth prospects willmaterialize, and the Companys ability to benefit from theMay acquisition is subject to both the risks affecting theCompanys business generally and the difficultiesassociated with integrating large business organizations.
