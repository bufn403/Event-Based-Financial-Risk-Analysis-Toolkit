 In addition to the other matters set forth in this Report, the continuing operations and the price of our common stock are subject to the following risks, each of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  The risks described below are only the risks that we currently believe are material to our business.  However, additional risks not presently known, or risks that are currently believed to be immaterial, may also impair our business operations. We are subject to general risks in the food industry, including, among other things, risk relating to changes in consumer preferences and product contamination as well as general economic conditions, any of which risks, if realized, could negatively impact our operating results and financial position. The food industry, and the markets within the food industry in which we compete, are subject to various risks, including the following: evolving consumer preferences, nutritional and health-related concerns, federal, state and local food inspection and processing controls, consumer product liability claims, risks of product tampering, and the availability and expense of liability insurance. The meat and poultry industries are subject to scrutiny due to the association of meat and poultry products with recent outbreaks of illness, and on rare occasions even death, caused by food borne pathogens. Product recalls are sometimes required in the food industry to withdraw contaminated or mislabeled products from the market.  Additionally, the failure to identify and react appropriately to changes in consumer trends, demands and preferences could lead to, among other things, reduced demand and price reduction for our products.  Further, we may be adversely affected by changes in domestic or foreign economic conditions, including inflation or deflation, interest rates, availability of capital markets, consumer spending rates, and energy availability and costs (including fuel surcharges).  These and other general risks related to the food industry, if realized by us, could have a significant adverse effect on demand for our products, as well as the costs and availability of raw materials, ingredients and packaging materials, thereby negatively affecting our operating results and financial position. Fluctuations in the prices that we pay for raw materials could negatively impact our financial results. We purchase large quantities of commodity pork, beef, and flour. Historically, market prices for products we process have fluctuated in response to a number of factors, including changes in the United States government farm support programs, changes in international agricultural and trading policies, weather, and other conditions during the growing and harvesting seasons. Our operating results are heavily dependent upon the prices paid for raw materials. The marketing of our value-added products does not lend itself to instantaneous changes in selling prices. Changes in selling prices are relatively infrequent and do not compare with the volatility of commodity markets.   While fluctuations in significant cost structure components, such as ingredient commodities and fuel prices, have had a significant impact on profitability over the last three years, the impact of general price inflation on our financial position and results of operations has not been significant. Future volatility of general price inflation or deflation and raw material cost and availability could adversely affect our financial results.                 7  We are subject to extensive government regulations and a failure to comply with such regulations could negatively impact our financial results. Our operations are subject to extensive inspection and regulation by the USDA, FDA and by other federal, state, and local authorities regarding the processing, packaging, storage, transportation, distribution, and labeling of products that are manufactured, produced and processed by us. Our processing facilities and products are subject to continuous inspection by the USDA and/or other federal, state, and local authorities. The USDA has issued strict regulations concerning the control of listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat meat and poultry products and contamination by food borne pathogens such as E. coli and salmonella, and implemented a system of regulation known as the HACCP program. The HACCP program requires all meat and poultry processing plants to develop and implement sanitary operating procedures and other program requirements. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) oversees safety compliance and establishes certain employer responsibilities to help “assure safe and healthful working conditions” and keep the workplace free of recognized hazards or practices likely to cause death or serious injury.   Failure to comply with regulations of OSHA could adversely affect our results of operations. We believe that we are currently in compliance with governmental laws and regulations and that we maintain necessary permits and licenses relating to our meat operations.   A failure to obtain or a loss of necessary permits and licenses could delay or prevent us from meeting current product demand and could adversely affect our operating performance.  Furthermore, we are routinely subject to new or modified laws, regulations and accounting standards.  If found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas, we could be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls, or asset seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our financial results. We depend on our key management, the loss of which could negatively impact our operations. Our executive officers and certain other key employees have been primarily responsible for the development and expansion of our business, and the loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could adversely affect us.  Our success will be dependent in part upon our continued ability to recruit, motivate, and retain qualified personnel. We cannot assure that we will be successful in this regard. We have no employment or non-competition agreements with key personnel. We depend on our major customers and any loss of such customers could have a negative impact on our profitability. We could suffer significant reductions in revenues and operating incomes if we lost one or more of our largest customers, including Wal-Mart®, which accounted for 34.8% of sales in fiscal year 2016.  Many of our customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs, and food distributors have consolidated in recent years.  Such consolidation has produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories while demanding lower pricing and increased promotional programs. These customers also may use their shelf space for their own private label products.  Failure to respond to these trends could reduce our volume and cause us to lower prices or increase promotional spending for our product lines which could adversely affect our profitability. With more than 80% concentration of beneficial ownership of our stock held by the Bridgford family, there are risks that they can exert significant influence or control over our corporate matters. Members of the Bridgford family beneficially own, in the aggregate, more than 80% of our outstanding stock. In addition, three members of the Bridgford family currently serve on the Board of Directors.  As a result, members of the Bridgford family have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over our management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by our shareholders, including amendments to by-laws, election and removal of directors, any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions.  This concentration of ownership may also delay or prevent a change in control otherwise favored by our other shareholders and could depress our stock price. Additionally, as a result of the Bridgford family’s significant ownership of the outstanding voting stock, we have relied on the “controlled company” exemption from certain corporate governance requirements of the NASDAQ stock market. Therefore, among other things, we have elected not to implement the rule that provides for a nominating committee to identify and recommend nominees to the Board of Directors and have instead elected to have the full Board of Directors perform such function.  Additionally, pursuant to this exemption, our compensation committee, which is made up of independent directors, does not have sole authority to determine the compensation of our executive officers, including our Chairman of the Board.  8   We participate in Multiemployer Pension Plans which could negatively impact our operations and profitability. We participate in “multiemployer” pension plans administered by labor unions on behalf of their employees. We make monthly contributions for healthcare and pension benefit obligations. The contribution amount may change depending upon the ability of participating companies to fund these pension liabilities as well as the actual and expected returns on pension plan assets. Should we withdraw from the union and cease participation in a union plan, federal law could impose a penalty for additional contributions to the plan. The penalty would be recorded as an expense in the consolidated statement of operations. The ultimate amount of the withdrawal liability is dependent upon several factors including the funded status of the plan and contributions made by other participating companies. During fiscal year 2014, we withdrew from the Western Conference of Teamsters Pension Plan and recorded an estimated pension expense and a corresponding non-current liability of $798,000 related to this plan. The amount recorded was paid in October 2015. We continue to participate in other multiemployer union plans. In the event of a full or partial withdrawal from these plans, the impact to our financial statements could be material.  Eminent domain and land risk regulations could negatively impact our financial results and financial position. We own real property on which we operate our processing and/or our distribution operations. As is the case with any owner of real property, we may be subject to eminent domain proceedings that can impact the value of investments we have made in real property as well as potentially disrupt our business operations. If subject to eminent domain proceedings or other government takings we may not be adequately compensated.   "

Historically, market prices for products we process have fluctuated in response to a number of factors, including changes in the United States government farm support programs, changes in international agricultural and trading policies, weather, and other conditions during the growing and harvesting seasons.Our operating results are heavily dependent upon the prices paid for raw materials. The marketing of our value-added products does not lend itself to instantaneous changes in selling prices. Changes in selling prices are relatively infrequent and do not compare with the volatility of commodity markets.   While fluctuations in significant cost structure components, such as ingredient commodities and fuel prices, have had a significant impact on profitability over the last three years, the impact of general price inflation on our financial position and results of operations has not been significant. Future volatility of general price inflation or deflation and raw material cost and availability could adversely affect our financial results.  7   We are subject to extensive government regulations and a failure to comply with such regulations could negatively impact our financial results.Our operations are subject to extensive inspection and regulation by the United States Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”), the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), and by other federal, state, and local authorities regarding the processing, packaging, storage, transportation, distribution, and labeling of products that are manufactured, produced and processed by us. Our processing facilities and products are subject to continuous inspection by the USDA and/or other federal, state, and local authorities. The USDA has issued strict policies concerning the control of listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat meat and poultry products and contamination by food borne pathogens such as E. coli and salmonella, and established a system of regulation known as the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (“HACCP”) program. The HACCP program requires all meat and poultry processing plants to develop and implement sanitary operating procedures and other program requirements. We believe that we are currently in compliance with governmental laws and regulations and that we maintain necessary permits and licenses relating to our meat operations.A failure to obtain or a loss of necessary permits and licenses could delay or prevent us from meeting current product demand and could adversely affect our operating performance.  Furthermore, we are routinely subject to new or modified laws, regulations and accounting standards.  If found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas, we could be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls, or asset seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our financial results.We depend on our key management, the loss of which could negatively impact our operations.Our executive officers and certain other key employees have been primarily responsible for the development and expansion of our business, and the loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could adversely affect us.  Our success will be dependent in part upon our continued ability to recruit, motivate, and retain qualified personnel. We can not assure that we will be successful in this regard. We have no employment or non-competition agreements with key personnel.We depend on our major customers and any loss of such customers could have a negative impact on our profitability.We could suffer significant reductions in revenues and operating income if we lost one or more of our largest customers, including Wal-Mart®, which accounted for 16.3% of sales in fiscal year 2012.  Many of our customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs, and food distributors have consolidated in recent years.  Such consolidation has produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories while demanding lower pricing and increased promotional programs. These customers also may use their shelf space for their own private label products.  Failure to respond to these trends could reduce our volume and cause us to lower prices or increase promotional spending for our product lines which could adversely affect our profitability.With more than 80% concentration of beneficial ownership of our stock held by the Bridgford family, there are risks that they can exert significant influence or control over our corporate matters.Members of the Bridgford family beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 81% of our outstanding stock. In addition, three members of the Bridgford family serve on the Board of Directors.  As a result, members of the Bridgford family have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over our management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by our shareholders, including amendments to by-laws, election and removal of directors, any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions.  This concentration of ownership may also delay or prevent a change in control otherwise favored by our other shareholders and could depress our stock price. Additionally, as a result of the Bridgford family’s significant ownership of the outstanding voting stock, we have relied on the “controlled company” exemption from certain corporate governance requirements of the NASDAQ stock market. Therefore, we have elected not to implement the rule that provides for a nominating committee to identify and recommend nominees to the Board of Directors and have instead elected to have the full Board of Directors perform such function.  Additionally, pursuant to this exemption, our compensation committee, which is made up of independent directors, does not have sole authority to determine the compensation of our executive officers, including our Chairman of the Board.  8   "

Changes in selling prices are relatively infrequent and do not comparewith the volatility of commodity markets.  While fluctuations in significant components of our cost structure, suchas commodities and fuel prices, have had a significant impact upon ourprofitability over the last three years, the impact of general price inflationon the Companys financial position and results of operations has not beensignificant during the last three years. However, future volatility of generalprice inflation and raw material cost and availability could adversely affectthe Companys financial results. Risks Relating to GovernmentRegulation The operations of the Company are subject to extensiveinspection and regulation by the United States Department of Agriculture (the USDA),the Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) and by other federal, state andlocal authorities, regarding the processing, packaging, storage,transportation, distribution and labeling of products that are manufactured,produced and processed by the Company. The Companys processing facilities andproducts are subject to continuous inspection by USDA and/or other federal,state and local authorities. On July 25, 1996, the USDA issued strict newpolicies concerning contamination by food borne pathogens such as E. coli,Listeria Monocytogenes and Salmonella, and established a new system ofregulation known as the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP)program. The HACCP program requires all meat and poultry processing plants todevelop and implement sanitary operating procedures and other programrequirements on or before January 26, 1998. The Company believes that itis currently in compliance with  governmental laws and regulations (including the January 1998 HACCPrequirements), and that it maintains necessary permits and licenses relating toits meat operations. On October 6, 2003, new USDA regulations regardingthe control of Listeria Monocytogenes in Ready-To-Eat Meat and Poultry Productstook effect. These regulations require environmental and/or finished producttesting for harmful bacteria that may be present. This testing could result inproducts being retained, recalled or destroyed if Listeria Monocytogenes isdetected. The Company is in full compliance with these regulations. A failure to obtain or a loss of necessary permits andlicenses could delay or prevent us from meeting current product demand andcould adversely affect operating performance. Furthermore, the Company is routinely subject to new or modified laws,regulations and accounting standards.  Iffound to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these orother areas, the Company could be subject to civil remedies, including fines,injunctions, recalls or asset seizures, as well as potential criminalsanctions, any of which could have a significant adverse effect on the Companysfinancial results. 7 Risks Relating to Dependence on KeyManagement The Companys executive officers and certain other keyemployees have been primarily responsible for the development and expansion ofthe Companys business, and the loss of the services of one or more of theseindividuals could have an adverse effect on the Company. The Companys successwill be dependent in part upon its continued ability to recruit, motivate andretain qualified personnel. There can be no assurance that the Company will besuccessful in this regard. The Company has no employment or non-competitionagreements with key personnel. Risks Relating to Changes in ConsumerPreference and Economic Conditions The food industry in general is subject to changingconsumer trends, demands and preferences. Failure to identify and react appropriately to changes in these factorscould lead to, among other things, reduced demand and price reduction for theCompanys products and could have an adverse effect on financial results.  Furthermore, the Company may be adverselyaffected by changes in domestic or foreign economic conditions, includinginflation, interest rates, availability of capital markets, consumer spendingrates, and energy availability and costs (including fuel surcharges).  Any such changes could have a significantadverse effect on demand for our products, as well as the costs andavailability of raw materials, ingredients and packaging materials, therebynegatively affecting financial results. Risks Relating to Loss of MajorCustomers The Company could suffersignificant reductions in revenues and operating income if we lost one or moreof our largest customers, including, for example, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,which accounted for 14.6% of revenues in fiscal year 2007.  Many of our customers, such as supermarkets,warehouse clubs and food distributors, have consolidated in recent years.  Such consolidation has produced large,sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable ofoperating with reduced inventories while demanding lower pricing and increasedpromotional programs. These customers also may use their shelf space for theirown private label products.  Failure torespond to these trends could reduce our volume and cause us to lower prices orincrease promotional spending for our product lines which could adverselyaffect our profitability. Members of the Bridgford Family Can ExerciseSignificant Control Members of the Bridgford family beneficially own, inthe aggregate, approximately 77% of the outstanding stock of the Company. Inaddition, three members of the Bridgford family serve on the Board ofDirectors.  As a result, members of theBridgford family have the ability to exert substantial influence or actualcontrol over our management and affairs and over substantially all mattersrequiring action by our shareholders, including amendments to by-laws, electionand removal of directors, any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all orsubstantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions.  This concentration of ownership may alsodelay or prevent a change in control otherwise favored by our othershareholders and could depress the Companys stock price. Additionally, as aresult of the Bridgford familys significant ownership of the outstandingvoting stock, we have relied on the controlled company exemption from certaincorporate governance requirements of the NASDAQ stock market; therefore, wehave elected not to implement the rule that provides for a nominating committeeto identify and recommend nominees to the Board of Directors.  Pursuant to these exemptions, ourcompensation committee, which is made up of independent directors, does nothave sole authority to determine the compensation of our executive officers,including our Chairman. "
