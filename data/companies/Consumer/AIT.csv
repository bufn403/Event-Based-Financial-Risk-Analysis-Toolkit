6,AIT,APPLIED INDUSTRIAL TECH INC,2023-08-11,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.In addition to other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.  The risks described below are not the only risks facing the Company.  Certain risks are identified below in Item 7 under the caption “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”  This information is incorporated here by reference.  Additional risks not currently known to us, risks that could apply broadly to issuers, or risks that we currently deem immaterial, may also impact our business and operations.  Risks can also change over time.  Further, the disclosure of a risk should not be interpreted to imply that the risk has not already materialized.  GENERAL ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY RISKSOur business depends heavily on the operating levels of our customers and the factors that affect them, including general economic conditions.  The markets for our products and services are subject to conditions or events that affect demand for goods and materials that our customers produce.  Consequently, demand for our products and services has been and will continue to be influenced by most of the same factors that affect demand for and production of customers' goods and materials.When customers or prospective customers reduce production levels because of lower demand, increased supply, higher costs, supply chain or labor market disruptions, tight credit conditions, unfavorable currency exchange rates, adverse trade policies, foreign competition, other competitive disadvantage, offshoring of production, geopolitical instability, or other reasons, their need for our products and services diminishes.  Selling prices and terms of sale come under pressure, adversely affecting the profitability and the durability of customer relationships, and credit losses may increase.  Inventory management becomes more difficult in times of economic uncertainty.  Volatile economic and credit conditions also make it more difficult for us, as well as our customers and suppliers, to forecast and plan future business activities.Our business, results of operation and financial condition have been, and could in the future be, adversely affected by a pandemic, epidemic or other public health emergency.  The COVID-19 pandemic created significant volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption, and resulted in lost or delayed sales to us, and we 7Table of Contentsexperienced business disruptions as we modified our business practices. Another pandemic, including a new COVID-19 variant, or other public health emergency, together with preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate such crises, could impact our results of operations and financial condition in a variety of ways, such as: impact our customers such that the demand for our products and services could change; disrupt our supply chain and impact the ability of our suppliers to provide products as required; disrupt our ability to sell and provide our products and services and otherwise operate effectively; increase incremental costs resulting from the adoption of preventative measures and compliance with regulatory requirements; create financial hardship on customers, including by creating restrictions on their ability to pay for our services and products; result in closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers or suppliers; and reduce customer demand on purchasing incentives we earn from suppliers. In addition, a pandemic or other public health emergency could impact the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, product and energy costs, labor supply and costs, and interest rates.  Any pandemic or other public health emergency could also amplify the other risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We cannot reasonably predict the ultimate impact of any pandemic or other public health emergency, including the extent of any adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, which will depend on, among other things, the duration and spread, the impact of governmental regulations that may be imposed in response, the effectiveness of actions taken to contain or mitigate the outbreak, the availability, safety and efficacy of vaccines, including against emerging variants of the infectious disease, and global economic conditions. Supply chain disruptions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.             Our supply chain, including transportation availability, staffing, and cost, could be disrupted by natural or human-induced events or conditions, such as power or telecommunications outage, security incident, terrorist attack, war, other geopolitical events, public health emergency, earthquake, extreme weather events, fire, flood, other natural disasters, transportation disruption, labor actions, including strikes, raw materials shortages, financial problems or insolvency, trade regulations or actions, inadequate manufacturing capacity or utilization to meet demand, or other reasons beyond our control.  For example, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted certain suppliers’ operations and our ability to procure product to meet customer demand fully and timely.  When we can find acceptable alternate sources for certain products, they may cost more.  Impairment of our ability to meet customer demand could result in lost sales, increased costs, reduced profitability, and damage to our reputation.Consolidation in our customers' and suppliers' industries could adversely affect our business and financial results.  Consolidation continues among our product suppliers and customers.  As customer industries consolidate or customers otherwise aggregate their purchasing power, a greater proportion of our sales could be derived from large volume contracts, which could adversely impact margins.  Consolidation among customers can produce changes in their purchasing strategies, potentially shifting blocks of business among competing distributors and contributing to volatility in our sales and pressure on prices.  Similarly, continued consolidation among suppliers could reduce our ability to negotiate favorable pricing and other commercial terms for our inventory purchases.  There can be no assurance we will be able to take advantage of consolidation trends.An increase in competition could decrease sales or earnings.  We operate in a highly competitive industry.    The industry remains fragmented, but is consolidating.  Our principal competitors are specialist and general line distributors of bearings, power transmission products, fluid power components and systems, flow control solutions, automation technologies, industrial rubber products, linear motion components, tools, safety products, oilfield supplies, and other industrial and maintenance supplies.  These competitors include local, regional, national, and multinational operations, and can include catalog and e-commerce companies.  Competition is largely focused in the local service area and is generally based on product line breadth, product availability, service capabilities, and price. Existing competitors have, and future competitors may have, greater financial or other resources than we do, broader or more appealing product or service offerings, greater market presence, stronger relationships with key suppliers or customers, or better name recognition.  If existing or future competitors seek to gain or to retain market share by aggressive pricing strategies or sales methods, business acquisition, or otherwise through competitive advantage, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected.  Our success will also be affected by our ability to continue to provide competitive offerings as customer preferences or demands evolve, for example with respect to product and service types, brands, quality, or prices.  Technological evolution or other factors can render product and service offerings obsolete, potentially impairing our competitive position and our inventory values.Our operations outside the United States increase our exposure to global economic and political conditions and currency exchange volatility.  Foreign operations contributed 13% of our sales in 2023.  This presence outside the U.S. increases risks associated with exposure to more volatile economic conditions, political 8Table of Contentsinstability, cultural and legal differences in conducting business (including corrupt practices), economic and trade policy actions, and currency exchange fluctuations.Our foreign operations' results are reported in the local currency and then translated into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements.  Fluctuations in currency exchange rates affect our operating results and financial position, as well as the comparability of results between financial periods.STRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL RISKSOur business could be adversely affected if we do not successfully execute our strategies to grow sales and earnings.  We have numerous strategies and initiatives to grow sales, leveraging the breadth of our product offering, supplier relationships, and value-added technical capabilities to differentiate us and improve our competitive position.  We also continually seek to enhance gross margins, manage costs, and otherwise improve earnings.  Many of our activities target improvements to the consistency of our operating practices across our hundreds of locations.  If we do not implement these initiatives effectively, or if for other reasons they are unsuccessful, our business could be adversely affected.Loss of key supplier authorizations, lack of product availability, or changes in distribution programs could adversely affect our sales and earnings.  Our business depends on maintaining an immediately available supply of various products to meet customer demand.  Many of our relationships with key product suppliers are longstanding, but are terminable by either party.  The loss of key supplier authorizations, or a substantial decrease in the availability of their products (including due to supply chain disruptions, as noted above), could put us at a competitive disadvantage and have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, as a distributor, we face the risk of key product suppliers changing their relationships with distributors generally, or us in particular, in a manner that adversely impacts us.  For example, key suppliers could change the following: the prices we must pay for their products relative to other distributors or relative to competing brands; the geographic or product line breadth of distributor authorizations; the number of distributor authorizations; supplier purchasing incentive or other support programs; product purchase or stocking expectations; or the extent to which the suppliers seek to serve end users directly.The purchasing incentives we earn from product suppliers can be impacted if we reduce our purchases in response to declining customer demand.  Certain product suppliers have historically offered to their distributors, including us, incentives for purchasing their products.  In addition to market, customer account-specific, or transaction-specific incentives, certain suppliers pay incentives to the distributor for attaining specific purchase volumes during a program period.   In some cases, to earn incentives, we must achieve year-over-year growth in purchases with the supplier.  When demand for our products declines, we may be less inclined to add inventory to take advantage of certain incentive programs, thereby potentially adversely impacting our profitability.Volatility in product, energy, labor, and other costs can affect our profitability.  Product manufacturers may adjust the prices of products we distribute for many reasons, including changes in their costs for raw materials, components, energy, labor, and tariffs and taxes on imports.  In addition, a portion of our own distribution costs is composed of fuel for our sales and delivery vehicles, freight, and utility expenses for our facilities.  Labor costs are our largest expense.  Our ability to pass along increases in our costs in a timely manner to our customers depends on execution, market conditions, and contractual limitations.  Failing to pass along price increases timely in an inflationary environment, such as the current economic climate, or not maintaining sales volume while increasing prices, could significantly reduce our profitability.While increases in the cost of products, labor, or energy could be damaging to us, decreases in those costs, particularly if severe, could also adversely impact us by creating deflation in selling prices, which could cause our gross profit margin to deteriorate.  Changes in energy or raw materials costs can also adversely affect customers; for example, declines in oil, gas, and coal prices may negatively impact customers operating in those industries and, consequently, our sales to those customers.Changes in customer or product mix and downward pressure on sales prices could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline.  Because we serve thousands of customers in many end markets, and offer millions of products, with varying profitability levels, changes in our customer or product mix could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline.  Downward pressure on sales prices could also cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline.  We can experience downward pressure on sales prices as a result of deflation, pressure from customers to reduce costs, or increased competition.Our ability to transact business is highly reliant on information systems.  A disruption or security breach could materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operation.  We depend on information systems to, among other things, process customer orders, manage inventory and accounts receivable collections, 9Table of Contentspurchase products, manage accounts payable processes, ship products to customers on a timely basis, maintain cost-effective operations, provide superior service to customers, conduct business communications, and compile financial results.  A serious, prolonged disruption of our information systems, due to man-made or natural causes, including power or telecommunications outage, or breach in security, could materially impair fundamental business processes and increase expenses, decrease sales, or otherwise reduce earnings.Because of our reliance on information systems, we are vulnerable to the growing threat of damage or intrusion from computer viruses or other cyber-attacks, including ransomware and business e-mail compromise, on our systems.  Despite precautions taken to prevent or mitigate the risks of such incidents, breaches of our systems could not only cause business disruption, but could also result in the theft of funds, the theft, loss, or disclosure of proprietary or confidential information, or the breach of customer, supplier, or employee information.  A security incident involving our systems, or even an inadvertent failure to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations, could negatively impact our sales, damage our reputation, and cause us to incur unanticipated legal liability, remediation costs, and other losses and expenses.Acquisitions are a key component of our anticipated growth.  We may not be able to identify or to complete future acquisitions, to integrate them effectively into our operations, or to realize their anticipated benefits.  Many industries we serve are mature.  As a result, acquisitions of businesses have been important to our growth.  While we wish to continue to acquire businesses, we may not be able to identify and to negotiate suitable acquisitions, to obtain financing for them on satisfactory terms, or otherwise to complete acquisitions.  In addition, existing and future competitors, and private equity firms, increasingly compete with us for acquisitions, which can increase prices and reduce the number of suitable opportunities; the acquisitions they make can also adversely impact our market position.We seek acquisition opportunities that complement and expand our operations.  However, substantial costs, delays, or other difficulties related to integrating acquisitions could adversely affect our business or financial results.  For example, we could face significant challenges in consolidating functions, integrating information systems, personnel, and operations, and implementing procedures and controls in a timely and efficient manner.Further, even if we successfully integrate the acquisitions with our operations, we may not be able to realize cost savings, sales, profit levels, or other benefits that we anticipate from these acquisitions, either as to amount or in the time frame we expect.  Our ability to realize anticipated benefits may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: our ability to achieve planned operating results, to reduce duplicative expenses and inventory effectively, and to consolidate facilities; economic and market factors; the incurrence of significant integration costs or charges in order to achieve those benefits; our ability to retain key product supplier authorizations, customer relationships, and employees; our ability to address competitive, distribution, and regulatory challenges arising from entering into new markets (geographic, product, service, end-industry, or otherwise), especially those in which we may have limited or no direct experience; and exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the acquired company.  In addition, acquisitions could place significant demand on administrative, operational, and financial resources.An interruption of operations at our headquarters or distribution centers, or in our means of transporting product, could adversely impact our business.  Our business depends on maintaining operating activity at our headquarters and distribution centers, and being able to receive and deliver product in a timely manner.  A serious, prolonged interruption due to power or telecommunications outage, security incident, terrorist attack, war, public health emergency, earthquake, extreme weather events, other natural disasters, fire, flood, transportation disruption, or other interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.FINANCIAL AND REPORTING RISKSOur indebtedness entails debt service commitments that could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations and could limit or reduce our flexibility.  As of June 30, 2023, we had total debt obligations outstanding of $622.2 million.  Our ability to service our debt and fund our other liquidity needs will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future.  Our debt commitments may (i) require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of debt service, reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund planned capital expenditures, pay dividends, repurchase our shares, complete other acquisitions or strategic initiatives, and other general corporate purposes; (ii) limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future (either at all or on satisfactory terms) to enable us to react to changes in our business or execute our growth strategies; and (iii) place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our industry that have lower levels of indebtedness.  Additionally, any failure to comply with covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default.  Any of the foregoing events or circumstances relating to our indebtedness may adversely affect our business, financial position, or results of operations and may cause our stock price to decline.10Table of ContentsIn addition, the increase in interest rates has created some tightening in the credit markets.  If credit markets continue to tighten, or if it creates credit market volatility, obtaining additional or replacement financing could be more difficult and the cost of issuing new debt or replacing a credit facility could be higher than under our current facilities.  For more information regarding borrowing and interest rates, see the following sections below: “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7 under the caption “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations;” Item 7A under the caption “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk;” and notes 6 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, included below in Item 8 under the caption “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”  That information is incorporated here by reference.Our ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting may be insufficient to allow us to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and this could cause our financial statements to become materially misleading and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.  We require effective internal control over financial reporting in order to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud.  Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud.  Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements.  If we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial statements and effectively prevent fraud, our financial statements could be materially misstated, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.If we are not able to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed.  Any material weakness could affect investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements.  As a result, our ability to obtain any additional financing, or additional financing on favorable terms, could be materially and adversely affected.  This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and the market value of our stock and require us to incur additional costs to improve our internal control systems and procedures.  In addition, perceptions of the Company among customers, suppliers, lenders, investors, securities analysts, and others could also be adversely affected.Goodwill, long-lived, and other intangible assets recorded as a result of our acquisitions could become impaired.  We review goodwill, long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and identifiable amortizing intangible assets, for impairment whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying amounts are not recoverable.  Factors which may cause an impairment of long-lived assets include significant changes in the manner of use of these assets, negative industry or market trends, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, or a likely sale or disposal of the asset before the end of its estimated useful life.  In 2021, we recorded a $49.5 million non-cash charge for the impairment of certain intangible, lease, and fixed assets.As of June 30, 2023, we had remaining $578.4 million of goodwill and $235.5 million of other intangible assets, net.  We assess all existing goodwill at least annually for impairment on a reporting unit basis.  The techniques used in our qualitative assessment and goodwill impairment tests incorporate a number of estimates and assumptions that are subject to change.  Although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and reflect market conditions forecasted at the assessment date, any changes to these assumptions and estimates due to market conditions or otherwise may lead to an outcome where impairment charges would be required in future periods.GENERAL RISK FACTORSOur business depends on our ability to attract, develop, motivate, and retain qualified employees.  Our success depends on hiring, developing, motivating, and retaining key employees, including executive, managerial, sales, professional, and other personnel.  We may have difficulty identifying and hiring qualified personnel.  In addition, we may have difficulty retaining such personnel once hired, and key people may leave and compete against us.  With respect to sales and customer service positions in particular, we greatly benefit from having employees who are familiar with the products and services we sell, and their applications, as well as with our customer and supplier relationships.  The loss of key employees or our failure to attract and retain other qualified workers could disrupt or adversely affect our business.  In addition, our operating results could be adversely affected by increased competition for employees, shortages of qualified workers, higher employee turnover (including through retirement as the workforce ages), or increased employee compensation or benefit costs.We are subject to legal, regulatory, and litigation risks, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.  We are subject to a wide array of laws and regulations.  Changes in the legal and regulatory environment 11Table of Contentsin which we operate, including with respect to taxes, international trade, employment laws, and data privacy, could adversely and materially affect the Company.      In addition, from time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings that arise from our business.  These may, for example, relate to product liability claims, commercial disputes, personal injuries, or employment-related matters.  In addition, we could face claims or additional costs arising from our compliance with regulatory requirements, including those relating to the following: our status as a public company; our government contracts; tax compliance; our engagement in international trade; and our collection, storage, or transmission of personal data. We maintain insurance policies that provide limited coverage for some, but not all, of the potential risks and liabilities associated with our business.  The policies are subject to limits, deductibles, and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a self-insured basis.  The defense and ultimate outcome of lawsuits or other legal proceedings or inquiries may result in higher operating expenses, the inability to participate in existing or future government contacts, or other adverse consequences, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.12Table of Contents"
0,AIT,APPLIED INDUSTRIAL TECH INC,2022-08-12,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.In addition to other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.  The risks described below are not the only risks facing the Company.  Certain risks are identified below in Item 7 under the caption “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”  This information is incorporated here by reference. Additional risks not currently known to us, risks that could apply broadly to issuers, or risks that we currently deem immaterial, may also impact our business and operations.  Risks can also change over time.  Further, the disclosure of a risk should not be interpreted to imply that the risk has not already materialized.  GENERAL ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY RISKSOur business depends heavily on the operating levels of our customers and the factors that affect them, including general economic conditions.  The markets for our products and services are subject to conditions or events that affect demand for goods and materials that our customers produce.  Consequently, demand for our products and services has been and will continue to be influenced by most of the same factors that affect demand for and production of customers' goods and materials.When customers or prospective customers reduce production levels because of lower demand, increased supply, higher costs, supply chain or labor market disruptions, tight credit conditions, unfavorable currency exchange rates, adverse trade policies, foreign competition, other competitive disadvantage, offshoring of production, geopolitical instability, or other reasons, their need for our products and services diminishes.  Selling prices and terms of sale come under pressure, adversely affecting the profitability and the durability of customer relationships, and credit losses may increase.  Inventory management becomes more difficult in times of economic uncertainty.  Volatile economic and credit conditions also make it more difficult for us, as well as our customers and suppliers, to forecast and plan future business activities.The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken in response thereto continue to impact our results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.  The COVID-19 pandemic created significant volatility, uncertainty, and economic 7Table of Contentsdisruption.  The effects of the pandemic resulted in lost or delayed sales to us, and we experienced business disruptions as we modified our business practices (including travel, work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings).  While the pandemic’s impact on social and economic conditions in the U.S. has subsided, the extent to which it will continue to impact our results of operations and financial condition will depend on evolving factors that are uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the following: the duration, spread, and severity of the pandemic, particularly due to virus variants, in the countries in which we operate or otherwise in our supply chain; responsive measures taken by governmental authorities, businesses, and individuals; the effect on our customers and their demand for our products and services; the effect on our suppliers and disruptions to the global supply chain; disruptions to our ability to sell and provide our products and services and otherwise operate effectively, including as a result of travel restrictions and associates working from home; disruptions to our operations resulting from associate illness; restrictions or disruptions to, or reduced availability of, transportation; customers’ ability to pay for our services and products; closures of our facilities or those of our customers or suppliers; the impact of reduced customer demand on purchasing incentives we earn from suppliers; and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.  In addition, the pandemic’s impact on the economy could affect the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, product and energy costs, labor supply and costs, and interest rates.  The pandemic’s effects may also amplify the other risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and may continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and/or stock price.Supply chain disruptions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.             Our supply chain could be disrupted by natural or human-induced events or conditions, such as power or telecommunications outage, security incident, terrorist attack, war, other geopolitical events, public health emergency, earthquake, extreme weather events, fire, flood, other natural disasters, transportation disruption, labor actions, raw materials shortages, financial problems or insolvency, trade regulations or actions, inadequate manufacturing capacity or utilization to meet demand, or other reasons beyond our control.  For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted certain suppliers’ operations and our ability to procure product to meet customer demand fully and timely, and may continue to do so in the future.  When we can find acceptable alternate sources for certain products, they may cost more. Impairment of our ability to meet customer demand could result in lost sales, increased costs, reduced profitability, and damage to our reputation.Consolidation in our customers' and suppliers' industries could adversely affect our business and financial results.  Consolidation continues among our product suppliers and customers.  As customer industries consolidate or customers otherwise aggregate their purchasing power, a greater proportion of our sales could be derived from large volume contracts, which could adversely impact margins.  Consolidation among customers can produce changes in their purchasing strategies, potentially shifting blocks of business among competing distributors and contributing to volatility in our sales and pressure on prices.  Similarly, continued consolidation among suppliers could reduce our ability to negotiate favorable pricing and other commercial terms for our inventory purchases.  There can be no assurance we will be able to take advantage of consolidation trends.An increase in competition could decrease sales or earnings.  We operate in a highly competitive industry.    The industry remains fragmented, but is consolidating.  Our principal competitors are specialist and general line distributors of bearings, power transmission products, fluid power components and systems, flow control solutions, automation technologies, industrial rubber products, linear motion components, tools, safety products, oilfield supplies, and other industrial and maintenance supplies.  These competitors include local, regional, national, and multinational operations, and can include catalog and e-commerce companies.  Competition is largely focused in the local service area and is generally based on product line breadth, product availability, service capabilities, and price. Existing competitors have, and future competitors may have, greater financial or other resources than we do, broader or more appealing product or service offerings, greater market presence, stronger relationships with key suppliers or customers, or better name recognition.  If existing or future competitors seek to gain or to retain market share by aggressive pricing strategies or sales methods, business acquisition, or otherwise through competitive advantage, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected.  Our success will also be affected by our ability to continue to provide competitive offerings as customer preferences or demands evolve, for example with respect to product and service types, brands, quality, or prices.  Technological evolution or other factors can render product and service offerings obsolete, potentially impairing our competitive position and our inventory values.Our operations outside the United States increase our exposure to global economic and political conditions and currency exchange volatility.  Foreign operations contributed 13% of our sales in 2022.  This presence outside the U.S. increases risks associated with exposure to more volatile economic conditions, political instability, cultural and legal differences in conducting business (including corrupt practices), economic and trade policy actions, and currency exchange fluctuations.8Table of ContentsOur foreign operations' results are reported in the local currency and then translated into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements.  Fluctuations in currency exchange rates affect our operating results and financial position, as well as the comparability of results between financial periods.STRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL RISKSOur business could be adversely affected if we do not successfully execute our strategies to grow sales and earnings.  We have numerous strategies and initiatives to grow sales, leveraging the breadth of our product offering, supplier relationships, and value-added technical capabilities to differentiate us and improve our competitive position.  We also continually seek to enhance gross margins, manage costs, and otherwise improve earnings.  Many of our activities target improvements to the consistency of our operating practices across our hundreds of locations.  If we do not implement these initiatives effectively, or if for other reasons they are unsuccessful, our business could be adversely affected.Loss of key supplier authorizations, lack of product availability, or changes in distribution programs could adversely affect our sales and earnings.  Our business depends on maintaining an immediately available supply of various products to meet customer demand.  Many of our relationships with key product suppliers are longstanding, but are terminable by either party.  The loss of key supplier authorizations, or a substantial decrease in the availability of their products (including due to supply chain disruptions, as noted above), could put us at a competitive disadvantage and have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, as a distributor, we face the risk of key product suppliers changing their relationships with distributors generally, or us in particular, in a manner that adversely impacts us.  For example, key suppliers could change the following: the prices we must pay for their products relative to other distributors or relative to competing brands; the geographic or product line breadth of distributor authorizations; the number of distributor authorizations; supplier purchasing incentive or other support programs; product purchase or stocking expectations; or the extent to which the suppliers seek to serve end users directly.The purchasing incentives we earn from product suppliers can be impacted if we reduce our purchases in response to declining customer demand.  Certain product suppliers have historically offered to their distributors, including us, incentives for purchasing their products.  In addition to market, customer account-specific, or transaction-specific incentives, certain suppliers pay incentives to the distributor for attaining specific purchase volumes during a program period.   In some cases, to earn incentives, we must achieve year-over-year growth in purchases with the supplier.  When demand for our products declines, we may be less inclined to add inventory to take advantage of certain incentive programs, thereby potentially adversely impacting our profitability.Volatility in product, energy, labor, and other costs can affect our profitability.  Product manufacturers may adjust the prices of products we distribute for many reasons, including changes in their costs for raw materials, components, energy, labor, and tariffs and taxes on imports.  In addition, a portion of our own distribution costs is composed of fuel for our sales and delivery vehicles, freight, and utility expenses for our facilities.  Labor costs are our largest expense.  Our ability to pass along increases in our costs in a timely manner to our customers depends on execution, market conditions, and contractual limitations.  Failing to pass along price increases timely in an inflationary environment, such as the current economic climate, or not maintaining sales volume while increasing prices, could significantly reduce our profitability.While increases in the cost of products, labor, or energy could be damaging to us, decreases in those costs, particularly if severe, could also adversely impact us by creating deflation in selling prices, which could cause our gross profit margin to deteriorate.  Changes in energy or raw materials costs can also adversely affect customers; for example, declines in oil, gas, and coal prices may negatively impact customers operating in those industries and, consequently, our sales to those customers.Changes in customer or product mix and downward pressure on sales prices could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline.  Because we serve thousands of customers in many end markets, and offer millions of products, with varying profitability levels, changes in our customer or product mix could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline.  Downward pressure on sales prices could also cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline.  We can experience downward pressure on sales prices as a result of deflation, pressure from customers to reduce costs, or increased competition.Our ability to transact business is highly reliant on information systems.  A disruption or security breach could materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operation.  We depend on information systems to, among other things, process customer orders, manage inventory and accounts receivable collections, purchase products, manage accounts payable processes, ship products to customers on a timely basis, maintain cost-effective operations, provide superior service to customers, conduct business communications, and compile financial 9Table of Contentsresults.  A serious, prolonged disruption of our information systems, due to man-made or natural causes, including power or telecommunications outage, or breach in security, could materially impair fundamental business processes and increase expenses, decrease sales, or otherwise reduce earnings.Because of our reliance on information systems, we are vulnerable to the growing threat of damage or intrusion from computer viruses or other cyber-attacks, including ransomware and business e-mail compromise, on our systems.  Despite precautions taken to prevent or mitigate the risks of such incidents, breaches of our systems could not only cause business disruption, but could also result in the theft of funds, the theft, loss, or disclosure of proprietary or confidential information, or the breach of customer, supplier, or employee information.  A security incident involving our systems, or even an inadvertent failure to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations, could negatively impact our sales, damage our reputation, and cause us to incur unanticipated legal liability, remediation costs, and other losses and expenses.Acquisitions are a key component of our anticipated growth.  We may not be able to identify or to complete future acquisitions, to integrate them effectively into our operations, or to realize their anticipated benefits.  Many industries we serve are mature.  As a result, acquisitions of businesses have been important to our growth.  While we wish to continue to acquire businesses, we may not be able to identify and to negotiate suitable acquisitions, to obtain financing for them on satisfactory terms, or otherwise to complete acquisitions.  In addition, existing and future competitors, and private equity firms, increasingly compete with us for acquisitions, which can increase prices and reduce the number of suitable opportunities; the acquisitions they make can also adversely impact our market position.We seek acquisition opportunities that complement and expand our operations.  However, substantial costs, delays, or other difficulties related to integrating acquisitions could adversely affect our business or financial results.  For example, we could face significant challenges in consolidating functions, integrating information systems, personnel, and operations, and implementing procedures and controls in a timely and efficient manner.Further, even if we successfully integrate the acquisitions with our operations, we may not be able to realize cost savings, sales, profit levels, or other benefits that we anticipate from these acquisitions, either as to amount or in the time frame we expect.  Our ability to realize anticipated benefits may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: our ability to achieve planned operating results, to reduce duplicative expenses and inventory effectively, and to consolidate facilities; economic and market factors; the incurrence of significant integration costs or charges in order to achieve those benefits; our ability to retain key product supplier authorizations, customer relationships, and employees; our ability to address competitive, distribution, and regulatory challenges arising from entering into new markets (geographic, product, service, end-industry, or otherwise), especially those in which we may have limited or no direct experience; and exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the acquired company.  In addition, acquisitions could place significant demand on administrative, operational, and financial resources.An interruption of operations at our headquarters or distribution centers, or in our means of transporting product, could adversely impact our business.  Our business depends on maintaining operating activity at our headquarters and distribution centers, and being able to receive and deliver product in a timely manner.  A serious, prolonged interruption due to power or telecommunications outage, security incident, terrorist attack, war, public health emergency, earthquake, extreme weather events, other natural disasters, fire, flood, transportation disruption, or other interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.FINANCIAL AND REPORTING RISKSOur indebtedness entails debt service commitments that could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations and could limit or reduce our flexibility.  As of June 30, 2022, we had total debt obligations outstanding of $689.5 million.  Our ability to service our debt and fund our other liquidity needs will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future.  Our debt commitments may (i) require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of debt service, reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund planned capital expenditures, pay dividends, repurchase our shares, complete other acquisitions or strategic initiatives, and other general corporate purposes; (ii) limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future (either at all or on satisfactory terms) to enable us to react to changes in our business or execute our growth strategies; and (iii) place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our industry that have lower levels of indebtedness.  Additionally, any failure to comply with covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default.  Any of the foregoing events or circumstances relating to our indebtedness may adversely affect our business, financial position, or results of operations and may cause our stock price to decline.Although the credit market turmoil of a decade ago did not have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity or borrowing costs, the availability of funds tightened and credit spreads on corporate debt increased.  If credit market 10Table of Contentsvolatility were to return, obtaining additional or replacement financing could be more difficult and the cost of issuing new debt or replacing a credit facility could be higher than under our current facilities.  Tight credit conditions could limit our ability to finance acquisitions on terms acceptable to us.For more information regarding borrowing and interest rates, see the following sections below: “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7 under the caption “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations;” Item 7A under the caption “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk;” and notes 6 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, included below in Item 8 under the caption “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”  That information is incorporated here by reference.Our ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting may be insufficient to allow us to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and this could cause our financial statements to become materially misleading and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.  We require effective internal control over financial reporting in order to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud.  Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud.  Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements.  If we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial statements and effectively prevent fraud, our financial statements could be materially misstated, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.If we are not able to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed.  Any material weakness could affect investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements.  As a result, our ability to obtain any additional financing, or additional financing on favorable terms, could be materially and adversely affected.  This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and the market value of our stock and require us to incur additional costs to improve our internal control systems and procedures.  In addition, perceptions of the Company among customers, suppliers, lenders, investors, securities analysts, and others could also be adversely affected.Goodwill, long-lived, and other intangible assets recorded as a result of our acquisitions could become impaired.  We review goodwill, long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and identifiable amortizing intangible assets, for impairment whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying amounts are not recoverable.  Factors which may cause an impairment of long-lived assets include significant changes in the manner of use of these assets, negative industry or market trends, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, or a likely sale or disposal of the asset before the end of its estimated useful life.  In 2021, we recorded a $49.5 million non-cash charge for the impairment of certain intangible, lease, and fixed assets.As of June 30, 2022, we had remaining $563.2 million of goodwill and $250.6 million of other intangible assets, net.  We assess all existing goodwill at least annually for impairment on a reporting unit basis.  The techniques used in our qualitative assessment and goodwill impairment tests incorporate a number of estimates and assumptions that are subject to change.  Although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and reflect market conditions forecasted at the assessment date, any changes to these assumptions and estimates due to market conditions or otherwise may lead to an outcome where impairment charges would be required in future periods.We may be adversely affected by changes to interest rates on our borrowings.  The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), announced in 2017 that it will no longer persuade or require banks to submit rates for LIBOR after 2021.  At the end of 2021, the ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator for LIBOR, ceased publishing one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and will cease publishing all remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors after June 30, 2023.  Any of our LIBOR-based borrowings that extend beyond June 30, 2023 will need to be converted to a replacement rate prior to that date.  Possible replacement rates include the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR).  Uncertainty as to the nature of such phase out and selection of an alternative reference rate, together with disruption in the financial markets, could increase the cost of our indebtedness that is currently tied to LIBOR. GENERAL RISK FACTORSOur business depends on our ability to attract, develop, motivate, and retain qualified employees.  Our success depends on hiring, developing, motivating, and retaining key employees, including executive, managerial, sales, professional, and other personnel.  We may have difficulty identifying and hiring qualified personnel.  In addition, we may have difficulty retaining such personnel once hired, and key people may leave and compete against 11Table of Contentsus.  With respect to sales and customer service positions in particular, we greatly benefit from having employees who are familiar with the products and services we sell, and their applications, as well as with our customer and supplier relationships.  The loss of key employees or our failure to attract and retain other qualified workers could disrupt or adversely affect our business.  In addition, our operating results could be adversely affected by increased competition for employees, shortages of qualified workers, higher employee turnover (including through retirement as the workforce ages), or increased employee compensation or benefit costs.We are subject to legal, regulatory, and litigation risks, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.  We are subject to a wide array of laws and regulations.  Changes in the legal and regulatory environment in which we operate, including with respect to taxes, international trade, employment laws, and data privacy, could adversely and materially affect the Company.      In addition, from time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings that arise from our business.  These may, for example, relate to product liability claims, commercial disputes, personal injuries, or employment-related matters.  In addition, we could face claims or additional costs arising from our compliance with regulatory requirements, including those relating to the following: our status as a public company; our government contracts; tax compliance; our engagement in international trade; and our collection, storage, or transmission of personal data. We maintain insurance policies that provide limited coverage for some, but not all, of the potential risks and liabilities associated with our business.  The policies are subject to limits, deductibles, and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a self-insured basis.  The defense and ultimate outcome of lawsuits or other legal proceedings or inquiries may result in higher operating expenses, the inability to participate in existing or future government contacts, or other adverse consequences, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.12Table of Contents"
13,AIT,APPLIED INDUSTRIAL TECH INC,2021-08-17,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.In addition to other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.  The risks described below are not the only risks facing the Company.  Certain risks are identified below in Item 7 under the caption “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”  This information is incorporated here by reference. Additional risks not currently known to us, risks that could apply broadly to issuers, or risks that we currently deem immaterial, may also impact our business and operations.  Risks can also change over time.  Further, the disclosure of a risk should not be interpreted to imply that the risk has not already materialized. GENERAL ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY RISKSOur business depends heavily on the operating levels of our customers and the factors that affect them, including general economic conditions.  The markets for our products and services are subject to conditions or events that affect demand for goods and materials that our customers produce.  Consequently, demand for our products and services has been and will continue to be influenced by most of the same factors that affect demand for and production of customers' goods and materials.When customers or prospective customers reduce production levels because of lower demand, increased supply, higher costs, tight credit conditions, unfavorable currency exchange rates, adverse trade policies, foreign competition, other competitive disadvantage, offshoring of production, or other reasons, their need for our products and services diminishes.  Selling prices and terms of sale come under pressure, adversely affecting the profitability and the durability of customer relationships, and credit losses may increase.  Inventory management becomes more difficult in times of economic uncertainty.  Volatile economic and credit conditions also make it more difficult for us, as well as our customers and suppliers, to forecast and plan future business activities.7Table of ContentsThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken in response thereto continue to impact our results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.  The COVID-19 pandemic created significant volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption.  The effects of the pandemic resulted in lost or delayed sales to us, and we experienced business disruptions as we modified our business practices (including travel, work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings).  While the pandemic’s impact on social and economic conditions has subsided, the extent to which it will continue to impact our results of operations and financial condition will depend on evolving factors that are uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the following: the duration, spread, and severity of the pandemic, including due to virus variants, in the countries in which we operate; responsive measures taken by governmental authorities, businesses, and individuals; the effect on our customers and their demand for our products and services; the effect on our suppliers and disruptions to the global supply chain; our ability to sell and provide our products and services and otherwise operate effectively, including as a result of travel restrictions and associates working from home; disruptions to our operations resulting from associate illness; restrictions or disruptions to, or reduced availability of, transportation; customers’ ability to pay for our services and products; closures of our facilities or those of our customers or suppliers; the impact of reduced customer demand on purchasing incentives we earn from suppliers; and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.  In addition, the pandemic’s impact on the economy could affect the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, product and energy costs, and interest rates.  The pandemic’s effects may also amplify the other risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and may continue to materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and/or stock price.Consolidation in our customers' and suppliers' industries could adversely affect our business and financial results.  Consolidation continues among our product suppliers and customers.  As customer industries consolidate or customers otherwise aggregate their purchasing power, a greater proportion of our sales could be derived from large volume contracts, which could adversely impact margins.  Consolidation among customers can produce changes in their purchasing strategies, potentially shifting blocks of business among competing distributors and contributing to volatility in our sales and pressure on prices.  Similarly, continued consolidation among suppliers could reduce our ability to negotiate favorable pricing and other commercial terms for our inventory purchases.  There can be no assurance we will be able to take advantage of consolidation trends.An increase in competition could decrease sales or earnings.  We operate in a highly competitive industry.  The industry remains fragmented, but is consolidating.  Our principal competitors are specialist and general line distributors of bearings, power transmission products, fluid power components and systems, flow control solutions, automation technologies, industrial rubber products, linear motion components, tools, safety products, oilfield supplies, and other industrial and maintenance supplies.  These competitors include local, regional, national, and multinational operations, and can include catalog and e-commerce companies.  Competition is largely focused in the local service area and is generally based on product line breadth, product availability, service capabilities, and price. Existing competitors have, and future competitors may have, greater financial or other resources than we do, broader or more appealing product or service offerings, greater market presence, stronger relationships with key suppliers or customers, or better name recognition.  If existing or future competitors seek to gain or to retain market share by aggressive pricing strategies and sales methods, or otherwise through competitive advantage, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected.  Our success will also be affected by our ability to continue to provide competitive offerings as customer preferences or demands evolve, for example with respect to product and service types, brands, quality, or prices.  Technological evolution or other factors can render product and service offerings obsolete, potentially impairing our competitive position and our inventory values.Our operations outside the United States increase our exposure to global economic and political conditions and currency exchange volatility.  Foreign operations contributed 14% of our sales in 2021.  This presence outside the U.S. increases risks associated with exposure to more volatile economic conditions, political instability, cultural and legal differences in conducting business (including corrupt practices), economic and trade policy actions, and currency exchange fluctuations.Our foreign operations' results are reported in the local currency and then translated into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements.  Fluctuations in currency exchange rates affect our operating results and financial position, as well as the comparability of results between financial periods.STRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL RISKSOur business could be adversely affected if we do not successfully execute our strategies to grow sales and earnings.  We have numerous strategies and initiatives to grow sales, leveraging the breadth of our product offering, supplier relationships, and value-added technical capabilities to differentiate us and improve our 8Table of Contentscompetitive position.  We also continually seek to enhance gross margins, manage costs, and otherwise improve earnings.  Many of our activities target improvements to the consistency of our operating practices across our hundreds of locations.  If we do not implement these initiatives effectively, or if for other reasons they are unsuccessful, our business could be adversely affected.Loss of key supplier authorizations, lack of product availability, or changes in distribution programs could adversely affect our sales and earnings.  Our business depends on maintaining an immediately available supply of various products to meet customer demand.  Many of our relationships with key product suppliers are longstanding, but are terminable by either party.  The loss of key supplier authorizations, or a substantial decrease in the availability of their products, could put us at a competitive disadvantage and have a material adverse effect on our business. Supply interruptions could arise from raw materials shortages, inadequate manufacturing capacity or utilization to meet demand, financial problems or insolvency, trade issues, labor disputes, public health emergencies, weather conditions affecting suppliers' production, transportation disruptions, or other reasons beyond our control.In addition, as a distributor, we face the risk of key product suppliers changing their relationships with distributors generally, or us in particular, in a manner that adversely impacts us.  For example, key suppliers could change the following: the prices we must pay for their products relative to other distributors or relative to competing brands; the geographic or product line breadth of distributor authorizations; supplier purchasing incentive or other support programs; product purchase or stocking expectations; or the extent to which the suppliers seek to serve end users directly.The purchasing incentives we earn from product suppliers can be impacted if we reduce our purchases in response to declining customer demand.  Certain product suppliers have historically offered to their distributors, including us, incentives for purchasing their products.  In addition to market or customer account-specific incentives, certain suppliers pay incentives to the distributor for attaining specific purchase volumes during a program period.   In some cases, to earn incentives, we must achieve year-over-year growth in purchases with the supplier.  When demand for our products declines, we may be less inclined to add inventory to take advantage of certain incentive programs, thereby potentially adversely impacting our profitability.Volatility in product, energy, and other costs can affect our profitability.  Product manufacturers may adjust the prices of products we distribute for many reasons, including changes in their costs for raw materials, components, energy, labor, and tariffs and taxes on imports.  In addition, a portion of our own distribution costs is composed of fuel for our sales and delivery vehicles, freight, and utility expenses for our facilities.  Our ability to pass along increases in our product and distribution costs in a timely manner to our customers depends on execution, market conditions, and contractual limitations.  Failing to pass along price increases timely in an inflationary environment, or not maintaining sales volume while increasing prices, could significantly reduce our profitability.While increases in the cost of products or energy could be damaging to us, decreases in those costs, particularly if severe, could also adversely impact us by creating deflation in selling prices, which could cause our gross profit margin to deteriorate.  Changes in energy or raw materials costs can also adversely affect customers; for example, declines in oil, gas, and coal prices may negatively impact customers operating in those industries and, consequently, our sales to those customers.Changes in customer or product mix and downward pressure on sales prices could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline.  Because we serve thousands of customers in many end markets, and offer millions of products, with varying profitability levels, changes in our customer or product mix could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline.  Downward pressure on sales prices could also cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline.  We can experience downward pressure on sales prices as a result of deflation, pressure from customers to reduce costs, or increased competition.Our ability to transact business is highly reliant on information systems.  A disruption or security breach could materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operation.  We depend on information systems to, among other things, process customer orders, manage inventory and accounts receivable collections, purchase products, manage accounts payable processes, ship products to customers on a timely basis, maintain cost-effective operations, provide superior service to customers, conduct business communications, and compile financial results.  A serious, prolonged disruption of our information systems, due to man-made or natural causes, including power or telecommunications outage, or breach in security, could materially impair fundamental business processes and increase expenses, decrease sales, or otherwise reduce earnings.Because of our reliance on information systems, we are vulnerable to the growing threat of damage or intrusion from computer viruses or other cyber-attacks, including ransomware and business e-mail compromise, on our systems.  Despite precautions taken to prevent or mitigate the risks of such incidents, breaches of our systems could not only cause business disruption, but could also result in the theft of funds, the theft, loss, or disclosure of 9Table of Contentsproprietary or confidential information, or the breach of customer, supplier, or employee information.  A security incident involving our systems, or even an inadvertent failure to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations, could negatively impact our sales, damage our reputation, and cause us to incur unanticipated legal liability, remediation costs, and other losses and expenses.Acquisitions are a key component of our anticipated growth.  We may not be able to identify or to complete future acquisitions, to integrate them effectively into our operations, or to realize their anticipated benefits.  Many industries we serve are mature.  As a result, acquisitions of businesses have been important to our growth.  While we wish to continue to acquire businesses, we may not be able to identify and to negotiate suitable acquisitions, to obtain financing for them on satisfactory terms, or otherwise to complete acquisitions.  In addition, existing and future competitors, and private equity firms, increasingly compete with us for acquisitions, which can increase prices and reduce the number of suitable opportunities; the acquisitions they make can also adversely impact our market position.We seek acquisition opportunities that complement and expand our operations.  However, substantial costs, delays, or other difficulties related to integrating acquisitions could adversely affect our business or financial results.  For example, we could face significant challenges in consolidating functions, integrating information systems, personnel, and operations, and implementing procedures and controls in a timely and efficient manner.Further, even if we successfully integrate the acquisitions with our operations, we may not be able to realize cost savings, sales, profit levels, or other benefits that we anticipate from these acquisitions, either as to amount or in the time frame we expect.  Our ability to realize anticipated benefits may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: our ability to achieve planned operating results, to reduce duplicative expenses and inventory effectively, and to consolidate facilities; economic and market factors; the incurrence of significant integration costs or charges in order to achieve those benefits; our ability to retain key product supplier authorizations, customer relationships, and employees; our ability to address competitive, distribution, and regulatory challenges arising from entering into new markets (geographic, product, service, end-industry, or otherwise), especially those in which we may have limited or no direct experience; and exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the acquired company.  In addition, acquisitions could place significant demand on administrative, operational, and financial resources.An interruption of operations at our headquarters or distribution centers, or in our means of transporting product, could adversely impact our business.  Our business depends on maintaining operating activity at our headquarters and distribution centers, and being able to receive and deliver product in a timely manner.  A serious, prolonged interruption due to power or telecommunications outage, security incident, terrorist attack, public health emergency, earthquake, extreme weather events, other natural disasters, fire, flood, transportation disruption, or other interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.FINANCIAL AND REPORTING RISKSOur indebtedness entails debt service commitments that could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations and could limit or reduce our flexibility.  As of June 30, 2021, we had total debt obligations outstanding of $829.4 million.  Our ability to service our debt and fund our other liquidity needs will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future.  Our debt commitments may (i) require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of debt service, reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund planned capital expenditures, pay dividends, repurchase our shares, complete other acquisitions or strategic initiatives, and other general corporate purposes; (ii) limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future (either at all or on satisfactory terms) to enable us to react to changes in our business or execute our growth strategies; and (iii) place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our industry that have lower levels of indebtedness.  Additionally, any failure to comply with covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default.  Any of the foregoing events or circumstances relating to our indebtedness may adversely affect our business, financial position, or results of operations and may cause our stock price to decline.Although the credit market turmoil of a decade ago did not have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity or borrowing costs, the availability of funds tightened and credit spreads on corporate debt increased.  If credit market volatility were to return, obtaining additional or replacement financing could be more difficult and the cost of issuing new debt or replacing a credit facility could be higher than under our current facilities.  Tight credit conditions could limit our ability to finance acquisitions on terms acceptable to us.For more information regarding borrowing and interest rates, see the following sections below: “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7 under the caption “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations;” Item 7A under the caption “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk;” 10Table of Contentsand notes 6 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, included below in Item 8 under the caption “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”  That information is incorporated here by reference.Our ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting may be insufficient to allow us to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and this could cause our financial statements to become materially misleading and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.  We require effective internal control over financial reporting in order to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud.  Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud.  Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements.  If we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial statements and effectively prevent fraud, our financial statements could be materially misstated, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.If we are not able to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed.  Any material weakness could affect investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements.  As a result, our ability to obtain any additional financing, or additional financing on favorable terms, could be materially and adversely affected.  This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and the market value of our stock and require us to incur additional costs to improve our internal control systems and procedures.  In addition, perceptions of the Company among customers, suppliers, lenders, investors, securities analysts, and others could also be adversely affected.Goodwill, long-lived, and other intangible assets recorded as a result of our acquisitions could become impaired.  We review goodwill, long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and identifiable amortizing intangible assets, for impairment whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying amounts are not recoverable.  Factors which may cause an impairment of long-lived assets include significant changes in the manner of use of these assets, negative industry or market trends, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, or a likely sale or disposal of the asset before the end of its estimated useful life.  In 2021, we recorded a $49.5 million non-cash charge for the impairment of certain intangible, lease, and fixed assets.As of June 30, 2021, we had remaining $560.1 million of goodwill and $279.6 million of other intangible assets, net.  We assess all existing goodwill at least annually for impairment on a reporting unit basis.  The techniques used in our qualitative assessment and goodwill impairment tests incorporate a number of estimates and assumptions that are subject to change.  Although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and reflect market conditions forecasted at the assessment date, any changes to these assumptions and estimates due to market conditions or otherwise may lead to an outcome where impairment charges would be required in future periods.We may be adversely affected by changes in LIBOR reporting practices or the method by which LIBOR is determined.  As of June 30, 2021, we had approximately $738.6 million of aggregate consolidated indebtedness that was indexed to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”).  As of June 30, 2021, approximately $420.0 million of this variable rate debt was converted to a fixed rate through an interest rate swap.  The swap agreement, entered into in January 2019 and subsequently amended and extended, is indexed to LIBOR.  The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, announced in 2017 that it will no longer persuade or require banks to submit rates for LIBOR after 2021. However, in March 2021, the FCA proposed to extend publication of the most commonly used U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors, including those tenors most relevant to us, through June 30, 2023.  Any of our LIBOR-based borrowings that extend beyond June 30, 2023 will need to be converted to a replacement rate prior to that date. Regulators and industry groups have identified recommended alternatives for certain reference rates, but there continues to be considerable uncertainty about what benchmark or benchmarks will replace LIBOR and when that will occur.  The full impact of the transition away from LIBOR remains unclear, but the transition and related changes may have a material adverse impact on the availability of financing and on our financing costs.GENERAL RISK FACTORSOur business depends on our ability to attract, develop, motivate, and retain qualified employees.  Our success depends on hiring, developing, motivating, and retaining key employees, including executive, managerial, sales, professional, and other personnel.  We may have difficulty identifying and hiring qualified personnel.  In addition, we may have difficulty retaining such personnel once hired, and key people may leave and compete against us.  With respect to sales and customer service positions in particular, we greatly benefit from having employees who are familiar with the products and services we sell, and their applications, as well as with our customer and supplier 11Table of Contentsrelationships.  The loss of key employees or our failure to attract and retain other qualified workers could disrupt or adversely affect our business.  In addition, our operating results could be adversely affected by increased competition for employees, shortages of qualified workers, higher employee turnover (including through retirement as the workforce ages), or increased employee compensation or benefit costs.We are subject to legal, regulatory, and litigation risks, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. We are subject to a wide array of laws and regulations.  Changes in the legal and regulatory environment in which we operate, including with respect to taxes, international trade, employment laws, and data privacy, could adversely and materially affect the Company.      In addition, from time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings that arise from our business.  These may, for example, relate to product liability claims, commercial disputes, personal injuries, or employment-related matters.  In addition, we could face claims or additional costs arising from our compliance with regulatory requirements, including those relating to the following: our status as a public company; our government contracts; tax compliance; our engagement in international trade; and our collection, storage, or transmission of personal data. We maintain insurance policies that provide limited coverage for some, but not all, of the potential risks and liabilities associated with our business.  The policies are subject to limits, deductibles, and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a self-insured basis.  The defense and ultimate outcome of lawsuits or other legal proceedings or inquiries may result in higher operating expenses, the inability to participate in existing or future government contacts, or other adverse consequences, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.12Table of Contents"

RISK FACTORS.In addition to other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.  The risks described below are not the only risks facing the Company.  Certain risks are identified below in Item 7 under the caption “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”  This information is incorporated here by reference. Additional risks not currently known to us, risks that could apply broadly to issuers, or risks that we currently deem immaterial, may also impact our business and operations.  Risks can also change over time.Our business depends heavily on the operating levels of our customers and the factors that affect them, including general economic conditions.  The markets for our products and services are subject to conditions or events that affect demand for goods and materials that our customers produce.  Consequently, demand for our products and services has been and will continue to be influenced by most of the same factors that affect demand for and production of customers' goods and materials.When customers or prospective customers reduce production levels because of lower demand, increased supply, higher costs, tight credit conditions, unfavorable currency exchange rates, adverse trade policies, foreign competition, other competitive disadvantage, offshoring of production, or other reasons, their need for our products and services diminishes.  Selling prices and terms of sale come under pressure, adversely affecting the profitability and the durability of customer relationships, and credit losses may increase.  Inventory management becomes more difficult in times of economic uncertainty.  Volatile economic and credit conditions also make it more difficult for us, as well as our customers and suppliers, to forecast and plan future business activities.6Table of ContentsThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken in response thereto continue to impact our results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.  The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption.  The extent to which the pandemic continues to impact our results of operations and financial condition will depend on evolving factors that are uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the following: the duration, spread, and severity of the pandemic in the countries in which we operate; responsive measures taken by governmental authorities, businesses, and individuals; the effect on our customers and their demand for our products and services; the effect on our suppliers and disruptions to the global supply chain; our ability to sell and provide our products and services and otherwise operate effectively, including as a result of travel restrictions and associates working from home; disruptions to our operations resulting from associate illness; restrictions or disruptions to, or reduced availability of, transportation; customers’ ability to pay for our services and products; closures of our facilities or those of our customers or suppliers; the impact of reduced customer demand on purchasing incentives we earn from suppliers; and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.  The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted and will result in lost or delayed sales to us, and we have experienced business disruptions as we have modified our business practices (including travel, work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings).  In addition, the pandemic’s impact on the economy may affect the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, product and energy costs, and interest rates.  Even after the pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of any economic recession or depression that has occurred or may occur in the future.  The pandemic’s effects may also amplify the other risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and may continue to materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and/or stock price.Our business could be adversely affected if we do not successfully execute our strategies to grow sales and earnings.  We have numerous strategies and initiatives to grow sales, leveraging the breadth of our product offering, supplier relationships, and value-added technical capabilities to differentiate us and improve our competitive position.  We also continually seek to enhance gross margins, manage costs, and otherwise improve earnings.  Many of our activities target improvements to the consistency of our operating practices across our hundreds of locations. If we do not implement these initiatives effectively, or if for other reasons they are unsuccessful, our business could be adversely affected.Consolidation in our customers' and suppliers' industries could adversely affect our business and financial results.  Consolidation continues among our product suppliers and customers.  As customer industries consolidate or customers otherwise aggregate their purchasing power, a greater proportion of our sales could be derived from large volume contracts, which could adversely impact margins.  Consolidation among customers can trigger changes in their purchasing strategies, potentially shifting blocks of business among competing distributors and contributing to volatility in our sales and pressure on prices.  Similarly, continued consolidation among our suppliers could reduce our ability to negotiate favorable pricing and other commercial terms for our inventory purchases.  There can be no assurance we will be able to take advantage of consolidation trends.Loss of key supplier authorizations, lack of product availability, or changes in distribution programs could adversely affect our sales and earnings.  Our business depends on maintaining an immediately available supply of various products to meet customer demand.  Many of our relationships with key product suppliers are longstanding, but are terminable by either party.  The loss of key supplier authorizations, or a substantial decrease in the availability of their products, could put us at a competitive disadvantage and have a material adverse effect on our business. Supply interruptions could arise from raw materials shortages, inadequate manufacturing capacity or utilization to meet demand, financial problems or insolvency, trade issues, labor disputes, public health emergencies, weather conditions affecting suppliers' production, transportation disruptions, or other reasons beyond our control.In addition, as a distributor, we face the risk of key product suppliers changing their relationships with distributors generally, or us in particular, in a manner that adversely impacts us. For example, key suppliers could change the following: the prices we must pay for their products relative to other distributors or relative to competing brands; the geographic or product line breadth of distributor authorizations; supplier purchasing incentive or other support programs; product purchase or stocking expectations; or the extent to which the suppliers seek to serve end users directly.An increase in competition could decrease sales or earnings.  We operate in a highly competitive industry.  The industry remains fragmented, but is consolidating.  Our principal competitors are specialist and general line distributors of bearings, power transmission products, fluid power components and systems, flow control solutions, automation technologies, industrial rubber products, linear motion components, tools, safety products, oilfield supplies, and other industrial and maintenance supplies.  These competitors include local, regional, national, and 7Table of Contentsmultinational operations, and can include catalog and e-commerce companies.  Competition is largely focused in the local service area and is generally based on product line breadth, product availability, service capabilities, and price. Existing competitors have, and future competitors may have, greater financial or other resources than we do, broader or more appealing product or service offerings, greater market presence, stronger relationships with key suppliers or customers, or better name recognition.  If existing or future competitors seek to gain or to retain market share by aggressive pricing strategies and sales methods, or otherwise through competitive advantage, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected.  Our success will also be affected by our ability to continue to provide competitive offerings as customer preferences or demands evolve, for example with respect to our product and services portfolio or our e-commerce and inventory management solutions.  Technological evolution or other factors can render product offerings obsolete, potentially impairing our competitive position and our inventory values.The purchasing incentives we earn from product suppliers can be impacted if we reduce our purchases in response to declining customer demand.  Certain product suppliers have historically offered to their distributors, including us, incentives for purchasing their products.  In addition to market or customer account-specific incentives, certain suppliers pay incentives to the distributor for attaining specific purchase volumes during a program period.  In some cases, to earn incentives, we must achieve year-over-year growth in purchases with the supplier.  When demand for our products declines, we may be less inclined to add inventory to take advantage of certain incentive programs, thereby potentially adversely impacting our profitability.Trade policies can have an adverse impact on industries we sell into, potentially negatively affecting our net sales and profits.  Changes to trade policies or agreements, including the recently enacted United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), can disrupt geographic and industry demand trends.  While Applied primarily serves markets in the United States, a significant portion of our domestic customer base exports or serves exporters. U.S. government-imposed tariffs or taxes that penalize imports can be met with countermeasures by foreign governments, or can otherwise impact industrial production, and it becomes difficult to determine what the net effect of such actions is on Applied’s net sales and profits.  It is possible that such changes could adversely affect our financial results.Volatility in product, energy, and other costs can affect our profitability.  Product manufacturers may adjust the prices of products we distribute for many reasons, including changes in their costs for raw materials, components, energy, labor, and tariffs and taxes on imports. In addition, a portion of our own distribution costs is composed of fuel for our sales and delivery vehicles, freight, and utility expenses for our facilities.  Our ability to pass along increases in our product and distribution costs in a timely manner to our customers depends on execution, market conditions, and contractual limitations.  Failing to pass along price increases timely in an inflationary environment, or not maintaining sales volume while increasing prices, could significantly reduce our profitability.While increases in the cost of products or energy could be damaging to us, decreases in those costs, particularly if severe, could also adversely impact us by creating deflation in selling prices, which could cause our gross profit margin to deteriorate.  Changes in energy or raw materials costs can also adversely affect customers; for example, declines in oil, gas, and coal prices may negatively impact customers operating in those industries and, consequently, our sales to those customers.Changes in customer or product mix and downward pressure on sales prices could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline.  Because we serve thousands of customers in many end markets, and offer millions of products, with varying profitability levels, changes in our customer or product mix could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline.  Downward pressure on sales prices could also cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline.  We can experience downward pressure on sales prices as a result of deflation, pressure from customers to reduce costs, or increased competition.Our ability to transact business is highly reliant on information systems.  A disruption or security breach could materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operation.  We depend on information systems to, among other things, process customer orders, manage inventory and accounts receivable collections, purchase products, manage accounts payable processes, ship products to customers on a timely basis, maintain cost-effective operations, provide superior service to customers, conduct business communications, and compile financial results.  A serious, prolonged disruption of our information systems, due to man-made or natural causes, including power or telecommunications outage, or breach in security, could materially impair fundamental business processes and increase expenses, decrease sales, or otherwise reduce earnings.Because of our reliance on information systems, we are vulnerable to the growing threat of damage or intrusion from computer viruses or other cyber-attacks, including ransomware and business e-mail compromise, on our systems.  Despite precautions taken to prevent or mitigate the risks of such incidents, breaches of our systems could not only cause business disruption, but could also result in the theft of funds, the theft, loss, or disclosure of 8Table of Contentsproprietary or confidential information, or the breach of customer, supplier, or employee information.  A security incident involving our systems, or even an inadvertent failure to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations, could negatively impact our sales, damage our reputation, and cause us to incur unanticipated legal liability, remediation costs, and other losses and expenses.In recent years, we replaced multiple legacy information system applications with newer software platforms, to enhance our business information and transaction systems to support future growth.  We continue with and consider additional enterprise resource planning system conversions, on a smaller scale, in discrete business operations.  Despite extensive planning, we could experience disruptions related to the implementation because of the projects' complexity.  The potential adverse consequences could include delays, loss of information, diminished management reporting capabilities, damage to our ability to process transactions timely, harm to our control environment, diminished employee productivity, and unanticipated increases in costs.  Further, our ability to achieve anticipated operational benefits from new platforms is not assured.Acquisitions are a key component of our anticipated growth.  We may not be able to identify or to complete future acquisitions, to integrate them effectively into our operations, or to realize their anticipated benefits.  Many industries we serve are mature.  As a result, acquisitions of businesses have been important to our growth.  While we wish to continue to acquire businesses, we may not be able to identify and to negotiate suitable acquisitions, to obtain financing for them on satisfactory terms, or otherwise to complete acquisitions.  In addition, existing and future competitors, and private equity firms, increasingly compete with us for acquisitions, which can increase prices and reduce the number of suitable opportunities; the acquisitions they make can also adversely impact our market position.We seek acquisition opportunities that complement and expand our operations.  However, substantial costs, delays, or other difficulties related to integrating acquisitions could adversely affect our business or financial results.  For example, we could face significant challenges in consolidating functions, integrating information systems, personnel, and operations, and implementing procedures and controls in a timely and efficient manner.Further, even if we successfully integrate the acquisitions with our operations, we may not be able to realize cost savings, sales, profit levels, or other benefits that we anticipate from these acquisitions, either as to amount or in the time frame we expect.  Our ability to realize anticipated benefits may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: our ability to achieve planned operating results, to reduce duplicative expenses and inventory effectively, and to consolidate facilities; economic and market factors; the incurrence of significant integration costs or charges in order to achieve those benefits; our ability to retain key product supplier authorizations, customer relationships, and employees; our ability to address competitive, distribution, and regulatory challenges arising from entering into new markets (geographic, product, service, end-industry, or otherwise), especially those in which we may have limited or no direct experience; and exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the acquired company.  In addition, acquisitions could place significant demand on administrative, operational, and financial resources.We incurred a substantial amount of debt in 2018 to complete the acquisition of FCX Performance, Inc. (""FCX""), a distributor of specialty process flow control products and services.  The aggregate purchase price of FCX was $781.8 million.  To service our debt, we require a significant amount of cash that may limit our ability to pay dividends, repurchase our shares, or complete other acquisitions or strategic initiatives.  In connection with the FCX acquisition, we entered into a new credit facility pursuant to which we incurred approximately $780.0 million in term loan indebtedness and approximately $250.0 million in revolving indebtedness capacity.  This indebtedness substantially increased our leverage and requires significant future principal and interest payments.  As of June 30, 2020, we had total debt obligations outstanding of $935.3 million.  Our ability to service our debt and fund our other liquidity needs will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future.  The additional leverage may (i) require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of debt service, reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund planned capital expenditures, pay dividends, repurchase our shares, complete other acquisitions or strategic initiatives, and other general corporate purposes; (ii) limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future (either at all or on satisfactory terms) to enable us to react to changes in our business or execute our growth strategies; and (iii) place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our industry that have lower levels of indebtedness.  Additionally, any failure to comply with covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default.  Any of the foregoing events or circumstances relating to our additional indebtedness may adversely affect our business, financial position, or results of operations and may cause our stock price to decline.Goodwill, long-lived, and other intangible assets recorded as a result of our acquisitions could become impaired.  We review goodwill, long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and identifiable amortizing intangible assets, for impairment whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the 9Table of Contentscarrying amounts are not recoverable.  Factors which may cause an impairment of long-lived assets include significant changes in the manner of use of these assets, negative industry or market trends, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, or a likely sale or disposal of the asset before the end of its estimated useful life.  In 2020, we recorded a $131.0 million non-cash impairment charge for goodwill associated with the FCX business.As of June 30, 2020, we had $540.6 million of goodwill and $343.2 million of other intangible assets, net.  We assess all existing goodwill at least annually for impairment on a reporting unit basis.  The techniques used in our qualitative assessment and goodwill impairment tests incorporate a number of estimates and assumptions that are subject to change.  Although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and reflect market conditions forecasted at the assessment date, any changes to these assumptions and estimates due to market conditions or otherwise may lead to an outcome where impairment charges would be required in future periods.Tight credit markets could impact our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms or increase the cost of future financing.  Although the credit market turmoil of a decade ago did not have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity or borrowing costs, the availability of funds tightened and credit spreads on corporate debt increased.  If credit market volatility were to return, obtaining additional or replacement financing could be more difficult and the cost of issuing new debt or replacing a credit facility could be higher than under our current facilities.  Tight credit conditions could limit our ability to finance acquisitions on terms acceptable to us.For more information regarding borrowing and interest rates, see the following sections below: “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7 under the caption “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations;” Item 7A under the caption “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk;” and notes 6 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, included below in Item 8 under the caption “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”  That information is incorporated here by reference.Our ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting may be insufficient to allow us to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and this could cause our financial statements to become materially misleading and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.  We require effective internal control over financial reporting in order to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud.  Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud.  Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements.  If we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial statements and effectively prevent fraud, our financial statements could be materially misstated, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.If we are not able to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed.  Any material weakness could affect investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements.  As a result, our ability to obtain any additional financing, or additional financing on favorable terms, could be materially and adversely affected.  This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and the market value of our stock and require us to incur additional costs to improve our internal control systems and procedures.  In addition, perceptions of the Company among customers, suppliers, lenders, investors, securities analysts, and others could also be adversely affected.We cannot assure that any material weaknesses will not arise in the future due to our failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting.  In addition, although we have been successful historically in strengthening our controls and procedures, those controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or ensure the fair presentation of our financial statements included in our periodic reports filed with the SEC.Our business depends on our ability to attract, develop, motivate, and retain qualified employees.  Our success depends on hiring, developing, motivating, and retaining key employees, including executive, managerial, sales, professional, and other personnel.  We may have difficulty identifying and hiring qualified personnel.  In addition, we may have difficulty retaining such personnel once hired, and key people may leave and compete against us.  With respect to sales and customer service positions in particular, we greatly benefit from having employees who are familiar with the products and services we sell, and their applications, as well as with our customer and supplier relationships.  The loss of key employees or our failure to attract and retain other qualified workers could disrupt or adversely affect our business.  In addition, our operating results could be adversely affected by increased competition 10Table of Contentsfor employees, shortages of qualified workers, higher employee turnover (including through retirement as the workforce ages), or increased employee compensation or benefit costs.An interruption of operations at our headquarters or distribution centers, or in our means of transporting product, could adversely impact our business.  Our business depends on maintaining operating activity at our headquarters and distribution centers, and being able to receive and deliver product in a timely manner.  A serious, prolonged interruption due to power or telecommunications outage, security incident, terrorist attack, public health emergency, earthquake, extreme weather events, other natural disasters, fire, flood, transportation disruption, or other interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.There is no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock.  The timing, declaration, amount, and payment of dividends to our shareholders fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors and depend on many factors, including our financial condition and results of operations, as well as applicable law and business considerations that our Board of Directors considers relevant.  There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay a quarterly dividend.Additionally, if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our debt payment obligations, then our ability to pay dividends, if so determined by the Board of Directors, will be impaired and we may be required to attempt to restructure or refinance our debt, raise additional capital, or take other actions such as selling assets, reducing, or delaying capital expenditures, or reducing our dividend.  There can be no assurance, however, that any such actions could be effected on satisfactory terms, if at all, or would be permitted by the terms of our debt or our other credit and contractual arrangements.Our operations outside the United States increase our exposure to global economic and political conditions and currency exchange volatility.  Foreign operations contributed 13% of our sales in 2020.  This presence outside the U.S. increases risks associated with exposure to more volatile economic conditions, political instability, cultural and legal differences in conducting business (including corrupt practices), economic and trade policy actions, and currency exchange fluctuations.Our foreign operations' results are reported in the local currency and then translated into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements.  Fluctuations in currency exchange rates affect our operating results and financial position, as well as the comparability of results between financial periods.We may be adversely affected by changes in LIBOR reporting practices or the method by which LIBOR is determined.  As of June 30, 2020, we had approximately $764.3 million of aggregate consolidated indebtedness that was indexed to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”).  In addition, as of June 30, 2020, approximately $431.0 million of this variable rate debt was converted to a fixed rate through an interest rate swap.  The swap agreement was entered into in January 2019 and is indexed to LIBOR.  Central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, have commissioned working groups of market participants and official sector representatives with the goal of finding suitable replacements for LIBOR based on observable market transactions.  It is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative rates will occur over the course of the next few years.  The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it has commitments from panel banks to continue to contribute to LIBOR through the end of 2021, but that it will not use its powers to compel contributions beyond such date.  Accordingly, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the publication of such rates beyond 2021.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York and various other authorities have commenced the publication of reforms and actions relating to alternatives to U.S. dollar LIBOR.  Although the full impact of such reforms and actions, together with any transition away from LIBOR, including the potential or actual discontinuance of LIBOR publication, remains unclear, these changes may have a material adverse impact on the availability of financing, including LIBOR-based loans, and on our financing costs.We are subject to litigation and regulatory risk due to the nature of our business, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.  From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings that arise from our business.  These may, for example, relate to product liability claims, commercial disputes, personal injuries, or employment-related matters.  In addition, we could face claims over other matters, such as claims arising from our status as a public company or government contractor, our engagement in international trade, or otherwise relating to our compliance with a wide array of laws and regulations to which we are subject.  Our contracts with federal, state, and local governments subject us to various laws and regulations governing these contracts, increased costs of compliance, and the potential for government audits.  The defense and ultimate outcome of lawsuits or other legal proceedings or inquiries may result in higher operating expenses, the inability to participate in existing or future government contacts, or other adverse consequences, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.11Table of ContentsOur business is subject to risks, some for which we maintain third-party insurance and some for which we self-insure.  We may incur losses and be subject to liability claims that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.  We maintain insurance policies that provide limited coverage for some, but not all, of the potential risks and liabilities associated with our business.  The policies are subject to deductibles and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a self-insured basis.  For some risks, we may not obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented.  Because of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially, and in some instances, certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage.  As a result, we may not be able to renew existing insurance policies or procure other desirable insurance on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.  Even where insurance coverage applies, insurers may contest their obligations to make payments.  Our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by losses and liabilities from uninsured or underinsured events, as well as by delays in the payment of insurance proceeds, or the failure by insurers to make payments.In addition to the risks identified above, other risks to our future performance include, but are not limited to, the following:•changes in customer preferences for products and services of the nature, brands, quality, or cost sold by us;•changes in customer procurement policies and practices;•changes in the market prices for products and services relative to the costs of providing them;•changes in operating expenses;•organizational changes in the Company;•government regulation, legislation, or policies, including with respect to federal tax policy, international trade, data privacy and security, and government contracting;•the variability and timing of new business opportunities including acquisitions, customer relationships, and supplier authorizations;•the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions; and•changes in accounting policies and practices that could impact our financial reporting and increase compliance costs.12Table of Contents"
11,AIT,APPLIED INDUSTRIAL TECH INC,2019-08-16,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.In addition to other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.  The risks described below are not the only risks facing the Company.  Certain risks are identified below in Item 7 under the caption “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”  This information is incorporated here by reference. Additional risks not currently known to us, risks that could apply broadly to issuers, or risks that we currently deem immaterial, may also impact our business and operations.  Risks can also change over time.Our business depends heavily on the operating levels of our customers and the factors that affect them, including general economic conditions.  The markets for our products and services are subject to conditions or events that affect demand for goods and materials that our customers produce.  Consequently, demand for our products and services has been and will continue to be influenced by most of the same factors that affect demand for and production of customers' goods and materials.When customers or prospective customers reduce production levels because of lower demand, increased supply, higher costs, tight credit conditions, unfavorable currency exchange rates, adverse trade policies, foreign competition, other competitive disadvantage, offshoring of production, or other reasons, their need for our products and services diminishes.  Selling prices and terms of sale come under pressure, adversely affecting the profitability and the durability of customer relationships, and credit losses may increase.  Inventory management becomes more difficult in times of economic uncertainty.  Volatile economic and credit conditions also make it more difficult for us, as well as our customers and suppliers, to forecast and plan future business activities.Our business could be adversely affected if we do not successfully execute our initiatives to grow sales and earnings.  We have numerous initiatives underway to grow sales, enhance gross margins, manage costs, and otherwise improve our earnings and competitive position.  If we do not implement these initiatives effectively, or if for other reasons they are unsuccessful, our business could be adversely affected.Consolidation in our customers' and suppliers' industries could adversely affect our business and financial results.  Consolidation continues among our product suppliers and customers.  As customer industries consolidate or customers otherwise aggregate their purchasing power, a greater proportion of our sales could be derived from large volume contracts, which could adversely impact margins.  Consolidation among customers can trigger changes in their purchasing strategies, potentially shifting blocks of business among competing distributors and contributing to volatility in our sales and pressure on prices.  Similarly, continued consolidation among our suppliers could reduce our ability to negotiate favorable pricing and other commercial terms for our inventory purchases.  There can be no assurance we will be able to take advantage of consolidation trends.Loss of key supplier authorizations, lack of product availability, or changes in distribution programs could adversely affect our sales and earnings.  Our business depends on maintaining an immediately available supply of various products to meet customer demand.  Many of our relationships with key product suppliers are longstanding, but are terminable by either party.  The loss of key supplier authorizations, or a substantial decrease in the availability of their products, could put us at a competitive disadvantage and have a material adverse effect on our business.  Supply interruptions could arise from raw materials shortages, inadequate manufacturing capacity or utilization to meet demand, financial problems, trade issues, labor disputes, or weather conditions affecting suppliers' production, transportation disruptions, or other reasons beyond our control.In addition, as a distributor, we face the risk of key product suppliers changing their relationships with distributors generally, or us in particular, in a manner that adversely impacts us.  For example, key suppliers could change the following: the prices we must pay for their products relative to other distributors or relative to competing brands;  5Table of Contentsthe geographic or product line breadth of distributor authorizations; supplier purchasing incentive or other support programs; product purchase or stocking expectations; or the extent to which the suppliers seek to serve end-users directly.An increase in competition could decrease sales or earnings.  We operate in a highly competitive industry. The industry remains fragmented, but is consolidating.  Our principal competitors are specialist and general line distributors of bearings, power transmission products, fluid power components and systems, flow control solutions, industrial rubber products, linear motion components, tools, safety products, oilfield supplies, and other industrial and maintenance supplies.  These competitors include local, regional, national, and multinational operations, and can include catalog and e-commerce companies.  Competition is largely focused in the local service area and is generally based on product line breadth, product availability, service capabilities, and price.  Existing competitors have, and future competitors may have, greater financial or other resources than we do, broader or more appealing product or service offerings, greater market presence, stronger relationships with key suppliers or customers, or better name recognition.  If existing or future competitors seek to gain or to retain market share by aggressive pricing strategies and sales methods, or otherwise through competitive advantage, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected.  Our success will also be affected by our ability to continue to provide competitive offerings as customer preferences or demands evolve, for example with respect to our product and services portfolio or our e-commerce and inventory management solutions.  Technological evolution or other factors can render product offerings obsolete, potentially impairing our competitive position and our inventory values. The purchasing incentives we earn from product suppliers can be impacted if we reduce our purchases in response to declining customer demand.  Certain of our product suppliers have historically offered to their distributors, including us, incentives for purchasing their products.  In addition to market or customer account-specific incentives, certain suppliers pay incentives to the distributor for attaining specific purchase volumes during a program period.  In some cases, to earn incentives, we must achieve year-over-year growth in purchases with the supplier.  When demand for our products declines, we may be less inclined to add inventory to take advantage of certain incentive programs, thereby potentially adversely impacting our profitability.Trade policies can have an adverse impact on industries we sell into, potentially negatively affecting our net sales and profits.  Changes to trade policies can disrupt geographic and industry demand trends.  While Applied primarily serves markets in the United States, a significant portion of our domestic customer base exports or serves exporters.  U.S. government-imposed tariffs or taxes that penalize imports can be met with countermeasures by foreign governments, or can otherwise impact industrial production, and it becomes difficult to determine what the net effect of such actions is on Applied’s net sales and profits.  It is possible that such changes could adversely affect our financial results.Volatility in product, energy, and other costs can affect our profitability.  Product manufacturers may adjust the prices of products we distribute for many reasons, including changes in their costs for raw materials, components, energy, labor, and tariffs and taxes on imports.  In addition, a portion of our own distribution costs is composed of fuel for our sales and delivery vehicles, freight, and utility expenses for our facilities.  Our ability to pass along increases in our product and distribution costs in a timely manner to our customers depends on execution, market conditions, and contractual limitations.  Failing to pass along price increases timely in an inflationary environment, or not maintaining sales volume while increasing prices, could significantly reduce our profitability.While increases in the cost of products or energy could be damaging to us, decreases in those costs, particularly if severe, could also adversely impact us by creating deflation in selling prices, which could cause our gross profit margin to deteriorate.  Changes in energy or raw materials costs can also adversely affect customers; for example, declines in oil, gas, and coal prices may negatively impact customers operating in those industries and, consequently, our sales to those customers.Changes in customer or product mix and downward pressure on sales prices could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline.  Because we serve thousands of customers in many end markets, and offer millions of products, with varying profitability levels, changes in our customer or product mix could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline.  Downward pressure on sales prices could also cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline.  We can experience downward pressure on sales prices as a result of deflation, pressure from customers to reduce costs, or increased competition.Our ability to transact business is highly reliant on information systems.  A disruption or security breach could materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operation.  We depend on information systems to process customer orders, manage inventory and accounts receivable collections, purchase products, manage accounts payable processes, ship products to customers on a timely basis, maintain cost-effective operations, provide superior service to customers, and compile financial results.  A serious, prolonged disruption of 6Table of Contentsour information systems, due to manmade or natural causes, including power or telecommunications outage, or breach in security, could materially impair fundamental business processes and increase expenses, decrease sales, or otherwise reduce earnings.Because of our reliance on information systems, we may be vulnerable to the growing threat of damage or intrusion from computer viruses or other cyber-attacks on our systems.  Despite precautions taken to prevent or mitigate the risks of such incidents, an attack on our systems could not only cause business disruption, but could also result in the theft or disclosure of proprietary or confidential information, or a breach of customers, supplier, or employee information.  Such an incident could negatively impact our sales, damage our reputation, and cause us to incur unanticipated legal liability and costs.In recent years, we replaced multiple legacy information system applications with newer software platforms, to enhance our business information and transaction systems to support future growth.  We continue with and consider additional enterprise resource planning system conversions, on a smaller scale, in discrete business operations. Despite extensive planning, we could experience disruptions related to the implementation because of the projects' complexity.  The potential adverse consequences could include delays, loss of information, diminished management reporting capabilities, damage to our ability to process transactions timely, harm to our control environment, diminished employee productivity, and unanticipated increases in costs.  Further, our ability to achieve anticipated operational benefits from new platforms is not assured.Acquisitions are a key component of our anticipated growth.  We may not be able to identify or to complete future acquisitions, to integrate them effectively into our operations, or to realize their anticipated benefits.  Many industries we serve are mature.  As a result, acquisitions of businesses have been important to our growth.  While we wish to continue to acquire businesses, we may not be able to identify and to negotiate suitable acquisitions, to obtain financing for them on satisfactory terms, or otherwise to complete acquisitions.  In addition, existing and future competitors, and private equity firms, increasingly compete with us for acquisitions, which can increase prices and reduce the number of suitable opportunities; the acquisitions they make can also adversely impact our market position.We seek acquisition opportunities that complement and expand our operations.  However, substantial costs, delays, or other difficulties related to integrating acquisitions could adversely affect our business or financial results.  For example, we could face significant challenges in consolidating functions, integrating information systems, personnel, and operations, and implementing procedures and controls in a timely and efficient manner.Further, even if we successfully integrate the acquisitions with our operations, we may not be able to realize cost savings, sales, profit levels, or other benefits that we anticipate from these acquisitions, either as to amount or in the time frame we expect.  Our ability to realize anticipated benefits may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: our ability to achieve planned operating results, to reduce duplicative expenses and inventory effectively, and to consolidate facilities; economic and market factors; the incurrence of significant integration costs or charges in order to achieve those benefits; our ability to retain key product supplier authorizations, customer relationships, and employees; our ability to address competitive, distribution, and regulatory challenges arising from entering into new markets (geographic, product, service, end-industry, or otherwise), especially those in which we may have limited or no direct experience; and exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the acquired company.  In addition, acquisitions could place significant demand on administrative, operational, and financial resources.We incurred a substantial amount of debt to complete the acquisition of FCX Performance, Inc. To service our debt, we will require a significant amount of cash that may limit our ability to pay dividends, repurchase our shares, or complete other acquisitions or strategic initiatives.  On January 31, 2018, we acquired FCX Performance, Inc. (“FCX”), a distributor of specialty process flow control products and services, for an aggregate purchase price of $781.8 million.  In connection with the FCX acquisition, we entered into a new credit facility pursuant to which we incurred approximately $780.0 million in term loan indebtedness and approximately $250.0 million in revolving indebtedness capacity.  This indebtedness substantially increased our leverage and requires significant future principal and interest payments.  As of June 30, 2019, we had total debt obligations outstanding of $959.8 million.  Our ability to service our debt and fund our other liquidity needs will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future.  The additional leverage may (i) require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of debt service, reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund planned capital expenditures, pay dividends, repurchase our shares, complete other acquisitions or strategic initiatives, and other general corporate purposes; (ii) limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future (either at all or on satisfactory terms) to enable us to react to changes in our business or execute our growth strategies; and (iii) place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our industry that have lower levels of indebtedness.  Additionally, any failure to comply with covenants in the instruments governing our debt 7Table of Contentscould result in an event of default.  Any of the foregoing events or circumstances relating to our additional indebtedness may adversely affect our business, financial position, or results of operations and may cause our stock price to decline.Goodwill, long-lived, and other intangible assets recorded as a result of our acquisitions could become impaired.  We review goodwill, long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and identifiable amortizing intangible assets, for impairment whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying amounts are not recoverable.  Factors which may cause an impairment of long-lived assets include significant changes in the manner of use of these assets, negative industry or market trends, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, or a likely sale or disposal of the asset before the end of its estimated useful life.  In 2019 we recorded a $31.6 million non-cash impairment charge for intangible assets associated with the Company's upstream oil and gas industry operations in Canada.As of June 30, 2019, we had $662.0 million of goodwill and $368.9 million of other intangible assets, net.  We assess all existing goodwill at least annually for impairment on a reporting unit basis.  The techniques used in our qualitative assessment and goodwill impairment tests incorporate a number of estimates and assumptions that are subject to change.  Although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and reflect market conditions forecasted at the assessment date, any changes to these assumptions and estimates due to market conditions or otherwise may lead to an outcome where impairment charges would be required in future periods.Tight credit markets could impact our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms or increase the cost of future financing.  Although the credit market turmoil of a decade ago did not have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity or borrowing costs, the availability of funds tightened and credit spreads on corporate debt increased.  If credit market volatility were to return, obtaining additional or replacement financing could be more difficult and the cost of issuing new debt or replacing a credit facility could be higher than under our current facilities.  Tight credit conditions could limit our ability to finance acquisitions on terms acceptable to us.For more information relating to borrowing and interest rates, see the following sections below:  “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7 under the caption “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations;” Item 7A under the caption “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk;” and notes 6 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, included below in Item 8 under the caption “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”  That information is incorporated here by reference.Our ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting may be insufficient to allow us to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and this could cause our financial statements to become materially misleading and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.  We require effective internal control over financial reporting in order to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud.  Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud.  Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements.  If we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial statements and effectively prevent fraud, our financial statements could be materially misstated, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.If we are not able to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed.  Any material weakness could affect investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements.  As a result, our ability to obtain any additional financing, or additional financing on favorable terms, could be materially and adversely affected.  This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and the market value of our stock and require us to incur additional costs to improve our internal control systems and procedures.  In addition, perceptions of the Company among customers, suppliers, lenders, investors, securities analysts, and others could also be adversely affected.We cannot assure that any material weaknesses will not arise in the future due to our failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting.  In addition, although we have been successful historically in strengthening our controls and procedures, those controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or ensure the fair presentation of our financial statements included in our periodic reports filed with the SEC.Our business depends on our ability to attract, develop, motivate, and retain qualified employees.  Our success depends on hiring, developing, motivating, and retaining key employees, including executive, managerial, sales, professional, and other personnel.  We may have difficulty identifying and hiring qualified personnel.  In 8Table of Contentsaddition, we may have difficulty retaining such personnel once hired, and key people may leave and compete against us.  With respect to sales and customer service positions in particular, we greatly benefit from having employees who are familiar with the products and services we sell, and their applications, as well as with our customer and supplier relationships.  The loss of key employees or our failure to attract and retain other qualified workers could disrupt or adversely affect our business.  In addition, our operating results could be adversely affected by increased competition for employees, shortages of qualified workers, higher employee turnover (including through retirement as the workforce ages), or increased employee compensation or benefit costs.An interruption of operations at our headquarters or distribution centers, or in our means of transporting product, could adversely impact our business.  Our business depends on maintaining operating activity at our headquarters and distribution centers, and being able to receive and deliver product in a timely manner.  A serious, prolonged interruption due to power or telecommunications outage, terrorist attack, earthquake, extreme weather events, other natural disasters, fire, flood, or other interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.There is no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock.  The timing, declaration, amount, and payment of dividends to our shareholders fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors and depend on many factors, including our financial condition and results of operations, as well as applicable law and business considerations that our Board of Directors considers relevant.  There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay a quarterly dividend.Additionally, if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our debt payment obligations, then our ability to pay dividends, if so determined by the Board of Directors, will be impaired and we may be required to attempt to restructure or refinance our debt, raise additional capital, or take other actions such as selling assets, reducing, or delaying capital expenditures, or reducing our dividend.  There can be no assurance, however, that any such actions could be effected on satisfactory terms, if at all, or would be permitted by the terms of our debt or our other credit and contractual arrangements.Our operations outside the United States increase our exposure to global economic and political conditions and currency exchange volatility.  Foreign operations contributed 13% of our sales in 2019.  This presence outside the U.S. increases risks associated with exposure to more volatile economic conditions, political instability, cultural and legal differences in conducting business (including corrupt practices), economic and trade policy actions, and currency exchange fluctuations.Our foreign operations' results are reported in the local currency and then translated into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements.  Fluctuations in currency exchange rates affect our operating results and financial position, as well as the comparability of results between financial periods.We may be adversely affected by changes in LIBOR reporting practices or the method by which LIBOR is determined.  As of June 30, 2019, we had approximately $789 million of aggregate consolidated indebtedness that was indexed to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”).  In addition, as of June 30, 2019, approximately $463 million of this variable rate debt was converted to a fixed rate through an interest rate swap.  The swap agreement was entered into in January 2019 and is indexed to LIBOR. Central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, have commissioned working groups of market participants and official sector representatives with the goal of finding suitable replacements for LIBOR based on observable market transactions.  It is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative rates will occur over the course of the next few years.  The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it has commitments from panel banks to continue to contribute to LIBOR through the end of 2021, but that it will not use its powers to compel contributions beyond such date.  Accordingly, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the publication of such rates beyond 2021.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York and various other authorities have commenced the publication of reforms and actions relating to alternatives to U.S. dollar LIBOR.  Although the full impact of such reforms and actions, together with any transition away from LIBOR, including the potential or actual discontinuance of LIBOR publication, remains unclear, these changes may have a material adverse impact on the availability of financing, including LIBOR-based loans, and on our financing costs.We are subject to litigation and regulatory risk due to the nature of our business, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.  From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings that arise from our business.  These may, for example, relate to product liability claims, commercial disputes, personal injuries, or employment-related matters.  In addition, we could face claims over other matters, such as claims arising from our status as a public company or government contractor, or otherwise relating to our compliance with a wide array of laws and regulations to which we are subject.  The defense and ultimate outcome 9Table of Contentsof lawsuits or other legal proceedings or inquiries may result in higher operating expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.Our business is subject to risks, some for which we maintain third-party insurance and some for which we self-insure.  We may incur losses and be subject to liability claims that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.  We maintain insurance policies that provide limited coverage for some, but not all, of the potential risks and liabilities associated with our business.  The policies are subject to deductibles and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a self-insured basis.  For some risks, we may not obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented.  Because of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially, and in some instances, certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage.  As a result, we may not be able to renew existing insurance policies or procure other desirable insurance on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.  Even where insurance coverage applies, insurers may contest their obligations to make payments.  Our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by losses and liabilities from uninsured or underinsured events, as well as by delays in the payment of insurance proceeds, or the failure by insurers to make payments.In addition to the risks identified above, other risks to our future performance include, but are not limited to, the following:•changes in customer preferences for products and services of the nature, brands, quality, or cost sold by us;•changes in customer procurement policies and practices;•changes in the market prices for products and services relative to the costs of providing them;•changes in operating expenses;•organizational changes in the Company;•government regulation, legislation, or policies, including with respect to federal tax policy and international trade;•the variability and timing of new business opportunities including acquisitions, customer relationships, and supplier authorizations;•the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions; and•changes in accounting policies and practices that could impact our financial reporting and increase compliance costs.10Table of Contents"
3,AIT,APPLIED INDUSTRIAL TECH INC,2018-08-17,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.In addition to other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.  The risks described below are not the only risks facing our Company.  Certain risks are identified below in Item 7 under the caption “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”  This information is incorporated here by reference.  Additional risks not currently known to us, risks that could apply broadly to issuers, or risks that we currently deem immaterial, may also impact our business and operations.  Risks can also change over time.Our business depends heavily on the operating levels of our customers and the factors that affect them, including general economic conditions.  The markets for the products and services we sell are subject to conditions or events that affect demand for goods and materials that our customers produce.  Consequently, demand for our products and services has been and will continue to be influenced by most of the same factors that affect demand for and production of customers' goods and materials.When customers or prospective customers reduce production levels because of lower demand, increased supply, higher costs, tight credit conditions, unfavorable currency exchange rates, adverse trade policies, foreign competition, other competitive disadvantage, offshoring of production, or other reasons, their need for our products and services diminishes.  Selling prices and terms of sale come under pressure, adversely affecting the profitability and the durability of customer relationships, and credit losses may increase.  Inventory management becomes more difficult in times of economic uncertainty.  Volatile economic and credit conditions also make it more difficult for us, as well as our customers and suppliers, to forecast and plan future business activities.Our business could be adversely affected if we do not successfully execute our initiatives to grow sales and earnings.  We have underway numerous initiatives to grow sales, enhance gross margins, manage costs, and otherwise improve our earnings and competitive position. If we do not implement these initiatives effectively, or if for other reasons they are unsuccessful, our business could be adversely affected.Consolidation in our customers' and suppliers' industries could adversely affect our business and financial results. Consolidation continues among our product suppliers and customers.  As customer industries consolidate, a 5Table of Contentsgreater proportion of our sales could be derived from large volume contracts, which could adversely impact margins.  Consolidation among customers can trigger changes in their purchasing strategies, potentially shifting blocks of business among competing distributors and contributing to volatility in our sales and pressure on prices.  Similarly, continued consolidation among our suppliers could reduce our ability to negotiate favorable pricing and other commercial terms for our inventory purchases.  There can be no assurance we will be able to take advantage of consolidation trends.Loss of key supplier authorizations, lack of product availability, or changes in distribution programs could adversely affect our sales and earnings.  Our business depends on maintaining an immediately available supply of various products to meet customer demand.  Many of our relationships with key product suppliers are longstanding, but are terminable by either party.  The loss of key supplier authorizations, or a substantial decrease in the availability of their products, could put us at a competitive disadvantage and have a material adverse effect on our business.  Supply interruptions could arise from raw materials shortages, inadequate manufacturing capacity or utilization to meet demand, financial problems, trade issues, labor disputes, or weather conditions affecting suppliers' production, transportation disruptions, or other reasons beyond our control.In addition, as a distributor, we face the risk of key product suppliers changing their relationships with distributors generally, or us in particular, in a manner that adversely impacts us.  For example, key suppliers could change the following: the prices we must pay for their products relative to other distributors or relative to competing brands; the geographic or product line breadth of distributor authorizations; supplier purchasing incentive or other support programs; or product purchase or stocking expectations.An increase in competition could decrease sales or earnings. We operate in a highly competitive industry.  The industry remains fragmented, but is consolidating.  Our principal competitors are specialist and general line distributors of bearings, power transmission products, fluid power components and systems, flow control solutions, industrial rubber products, linear motion components, tools, safety products, oilfield supplies, and other industrial and maintenance supplies.  These competitors include local, regional, national, and multinational operations, and can include catalog and e-commerce companies.  Competition is largely focused in the local service area and is generally based on product line breadth, product availability, service capabilities, and price.  Existing competitors have, and future competitors may have, greater financial or other resources than we do, broader product or service offerings, greater market presence, stronger relationships with key suppliers or customers, or better name recognition.  If existing or future competitors seek to gain or to retain market share by aggressive pricing strategies and sales methods, or otherwise through competitive advantage, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected.  Our success will also be affected by our ability to continue to provide competitive offerings as customer preferences or demands evolve, for example with respect to our product and services portfolio or our e-commerce and inventory management solutions.The purchasing incentives we earn from product suppliers can be impacted if we reduce our purchases in response to declining customer demand. Certain of our product suppliers have historically offered to their distributors, including us, incentives for purchasing their products.  In addition to market or customer account-specific incentives, certain suppliers pay incentives to the distributor for attaining specific purchase volumes during a program period.  In some cases, to earn incentives, we must achieve year-over-year growth in purchases with the supplier.  When demand for our products declines, we may be less inclined to add inventory to take advantage of certain incentive programs, thereby potentially adversely impacting our profitability.Trade policies can have an adverse impact on industries we sell into, potentially negatively affecting our net sales and profits.  Changes to trade policies can disrupt geographic and industry demand trends.  While Applied primarily serves markets in the United States, a significant portion of our domestic customer base exports or serves exporters.  U.S. government-imposed tariffs or taxes that penalize imports can be met with countermeasures by foreign governments, and it becomes difficult to predict what the net effect of such actions will be on Applied’s net sales and profits.  It is possible that such changes could adversely affect our financial results.Volatility in product, energy, and other costs can affect our profitability.  Product manufacturers may adjust the prices of products we distribute for many reasons, including changes in their costs for raw materials, components, energy, labor, and tariffs and taxes on imports.  In addition, a portion of our own distribution costs is comprised of fuel for our sales and delivery vehicles, freight, and utility expenses for our facilities.  Our ability to pass along increases in our product and distribution costs in a timely manner to our customers depends on execution, market conditions, and contractual limitations.  Failing to pass along price increases timely in an inflationary environment, or not maintaining sales volume while increasing prices, could significantly reduce our profitability.While increases in the cost of products or energy could be damaging to us, decreases in those costs, particularly if severe, could also adversely impact us by creating deflation in selling prices, which could cause our gross profit 6Table of Contentsmargin to deteriorate.  Changes in energy or raw materials costs can also adversely affect customers; for example, declines in oil, gas, and coal prices may negatively impact customers operating in those industries and, consequently, our sales to those customers.Changes in customer or product mix and downward pressure on sales prices could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline.  Because we serve thousands of customers in many end markets, and offer millions of products, with varying profitability levels, changes in our customer or product mix could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline.  Downward pressure on sales prices could also cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline.  We can experience downward pressure on sales prices as a result of deflation, pressure from customers to reduce costs, or increased competition.Our ability to transact business is highly reliant on information systems.  A disruption or security breach could materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operation.  We depend on information systems to process customer orders, manage inventory and accounts receivable collections, purchase products, manage accounts payable processes, ship products to customers on a timely basis, maintain cost-effective operations, provide superior service to customers, and compile financial results.  A serious, prolonged disruption of our information systems, due to manmade or natural causes, including power or telecommunications outage, or breach in security, could materially impair fundamental business processes and increase expenses, decrease sales, or otherwise reduce earnings.Because of our reliance on information systems, we may be vulnerable to the growing threat of damage or intrusion from computer viruses or other cyber-attacks on our systems.  Despite precautions taken to prevent or mitigate the risks of such incidents, an attack on our systems could not only cause business disruption, but could also result in the theft or disclosure of proprietary or confidential information, or a breach of customers, supplier, or employee information.  Such an incident could negatively impact our sales, damage our reputation, and cause us to incur unanticipated legal liability and costs.In recent years, we replaced multiple legacy information system applications with newer software platforms, to enhance our business information and transaction systems to support future growth.  We continue with and consider additional enterprise resource planning system conversions, on a smaller scale, in discrete business operations.  Despite extensive planning, we could experience disruptions related to the implementation because of the projects' complexity.  The potential adverse consequences could include delays, loss of information, diminished management reporting capabilities, damage to our ability to process transactions timely, harm to our control environment, diminished employee productivity, and unanticipated increases in costs.  Further, our ability to achieve anticipated operational benefits from new platforms is not assured.Acquisitions are a key component of our anticipated growth.  We may not be able to identify or to complete future acquisitions, to integrate them effectively into our operations, or to realize their anticipated benefits. Many industries we serve are mature.  As a result, acquisitions of businesses have been important to our growth.  While we wish to continue to acquire businesses, we may not be able to identify and to negotiate suitable acquisitions, to obtain financing for them on satisfactory terms, or otherwise to complete acquisitions.  In addition, existing and future competitors, and private equity firms, increasingly compete with us for acquisitions, which can increase prices and reduce the number of suitable opportunities; the acquisitions they make can also adversely impact our market position.  We seek acquisition opportunities that complement and expand our operations.  However, substantial costs, delays, or other difficulties related to integrating acquisitions could adversely affect our business or financial results.  For example, we could face significant challenges in consolidating functions, integrating information systems, personnel, and operations, and implementing procedures and controls in a timely and efficient manner.Further, even if we successfully integrate the acquisitions with our operations, we may not be able to realize cost savings, sales, profit levels, or other benefits that we anticipate from these acquisitions, either as to amount or in the time frame we expect.  Our ability to realize anticipated benefits may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: our ability to achieve planned operating results, to reduce duplicative expenses and inventory effectively, and to consolidate facilities; economic and market factors; the incurrence of significant integration costs or charges in order to achieve those benefits; our ability to retain key product supplier authorizations, customer relationships, and employees; our ability to address competitive, distribution, and regulatory challenges arising from entering into new markets, especially those in which we may have limited or no direct experience; and exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the acquired company.  In addition, acquisitions could place significant demand on administrative, operational, and financial resources.7Table of ContentsWe may not realize the growth opportunities and cost synergies that are anticipated from our recent acquisition of FCX Performance, Inc.  On January 31, 2018, we acquired FCX Performance, Inc. (“FCX”), a distributor of specialty process flow control products and services, for an aggregate purchase price of $781.8 million.  The benefits that are expected to result from this sizable acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies as a result of the acquisition.  Our success in realizing these growth opportunities and cost synergies, and the timing of this realization, depends on a number of factors.  There is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating an acquisition as large as FCX.  While integration activities are well underway, the process of integrating operations could still cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, our activities or the activities of the FCX business.  Members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable time to the integration process, which decreases the time they will have to manage our other operations, service existing customers, and attract new business.  If senior management is not able to manage the integration process effectively, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer.  There can be no assurance that we will successfully or cost-effectively integrate FCX.  The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.Even if we are able to integrate FCX successfully, this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth opportunities and cost synergies we currently expect from the acquisition, and we cannot guarantee these benefits will be achieved within anticipated time frames or at all.  For example, we may not be able to eliminate duplicative costs.  Moreover, we may incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of FCX.  While it is anticipated that certain expenses will be incurred to achieve cost synergies, such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately and may exceed current estimates.  Accordingly, the benefits from the acquisition may be offset by costs incurred to integrate the business or delays in the integration process.  In addition, the overall integration may result in unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customers and other relationships, and loss of key employees, any of which may adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations and may cause our stock price to decline.We incurred a substantial amount of debt to complete the acquisition of FCX. To service our debt, we will require a significant amount of cash that may limit our ability to pay dividends, repurchase our shares, or complete other acquisitions or strategic initiatives.  In connection with the FCX acquisition, we entered into a new credit facility pursuant to which we incurred approximately $780.0 million in term loan indebtedness and approximately $250.0 million in revolving indebtedness.  This indebtedness substantially increased our leverage and requires substantial future principal and interest payments.  Our ability to service our debt and fund our other liquidity needs will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future.  This additional leverage may (i) require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of debt service, reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund planned capital expenditures, pay dividends, repurchase our shares, complete other acquisitions or strategic initiatives, and other general corporate purposes; (ii) limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future (either at all or on satisfactory terms) to enable us to react to changes in our business or execute our growth strategies; and (iii) place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our industry that have lower levels of indebtedness.  Additionally, any failure to comply with covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default.  Any of the foregoing events or circumstances relating to our additional indebtedness may adversely affect our business, financial position, or results of operations and may cause our stock price to decline.Goodwill and other intangible assets recorded as a result of our acquisitions could become impaired.  We review long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and identifiable amortizing intangible assets, for impairment whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying amounts are not recoverable.  If the fair value is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference.  Factors which may cause an impairment of long-lived assets include significant changes in the manner of use of these assets, negative industry or market trends, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, or a likely sale or disposal of the asset before the end of its estimated useful life.  In 2016 we recorded a $64.8 million non-cash impairment charge for goodwill associated with the service center based distribution reporting units in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.As of June 30, 2018, we had $646.6 million of goodwill and $435.9 million of other intangible assets, net.  We assess all existing goodwill at least annually for impairment on a reporting unit basis.  The techniques used in our qualitative assessment and goodwill impairment tests incorporate a number of estimates and assumptions that are subject to change.  Although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and reflect market conditions forecasted at the assessment date, any changes to these assumptions and estimates due to market conditions or otherwise may lead to an outcome where impairment charges would be required in future periods.8Table of ContentsTight credit markets could impact our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms or increase the cost of future financing. Although the credit market turmoil of a decade ago did not have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity or borrowing costs, the availability of funds tightened and credit spreads on corporate debt increased.  If credit market volatility were to return, obtaining additional or replacement financing could be more difficult and the cost of issuing new debt or replacing a credit facility could be higher than under our current facilities.  Tight credit conditions could limit our ability to finance acquisitions on terms acceptable to us.For more information relating to borrowing and interest rates, see the following sections below: “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7 under the caption “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations;” Item 7A under the caption “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk;” and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, included below in Item 8 under the caption “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”  That information is incorporated here by reference.Our ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting may be insufficient to allow us to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and this could cause our financial statements to become materially misleading and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.

Our success depends on hiring, developing, motivating, and retaining key employees, including executive, managerial, sales, professional, and other personnel.  We may have difficulty identifying and hiring qualified personnel.  In addition, we may have difficulty retaining such personnel once hired, and key people may leave and compete against us.  With respect to sales and customer service positions in particular, we greatly benefit from having employees who are familiar with the products we sell and their applications, as well as with our customer and supplier relationships.  The loss of key employees or our failure to attract and retain other qualified workers could disrupt or adversely affect our business.

The timing, declaration, amount, and payment of dividends to our shareholders fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors and depend on many factors, including our financial 9Table of Contentscondition and results of operations, as well as applicable law and business considerations that our Board of Directors considers relevant.  There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay a quarterly dividend.Additionally, if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our debt payment obligations, then our ability to pay dividends, if so determined by the Board of Directors, will be impaired and we may be required to attempt to restructure or refinance our debt, raise additional capital, or take other actions such as selling assets, reducing, or delaying capital expenditures, or reducing our dividend.  There can be no assurance, however, that any such actions could be effected on satisfactory terms, if at all, or would be permitted by the terms of our debt or our other credit and contractual arrangements.Our operations outside the United States increase our exposure to global economic and political conditions and currency exchange volatility.  Foreign operations contributed 14.9% of our sales in 2018.  This presence outside the U.S. increases risks associated with exposure to more volatile economic conditions, political instability, cultural and legal differences in conducting business (including corrupt practices), economic and trade policy actions, and currency exchange fluctuations.Our foreign operations' results are reported in the local currency and then translated into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements.  Fluctuations in currency exchange rates affect our operating results and financial position, as well as the comparability of results between financial periods.We are subject to litigation and regulatory risk due to the nature of our business, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.  From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings that arise from our business.  These may, for example, relate to product liability claims, commercial disputes, personal injuries, or employment-related matters.  In addition, we could face claims over other matters, such as claims arising from our status as a public company or government contractor, or otherwise relating to our compliance with a wide array of laws and regulations to which we are subject.  The defense and ultimate outcome of lawsuits or other legal proceedings or inquiries may result in higher operating expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.Our business is subject to risks, some for which we maintain third-party insurance and some for which we self-insure.  We may incur losses and be subject to liability claims that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.  We maintain insurance policies that provide limited coverage for some, but not all, of the potential risks and liabilities associated with our business.  The policies are subject to deductibles and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a self-insured basis.  For some risks, we may not obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented.  Because of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially, and in some instances, certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage.  As a result, we may not be able to renew existing insurance policies or procure other desirable insurance on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.  Even where insurance coverage applies, insurers may contest their obligations to make payments.  Our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by losses and liabilities from uninsured or underinsured events, as well as by delays in the payment of insurance proceeds, or the failure by insurers to make payments.In addition to the risks identified above, other risks to our future performance include, but are not limited to, the following:•changes in customer preferences for products and services of the nature, brands, quality, or cost sold by us;•changes in customer procurement policies and practices;•changes in the market prices for products and services relative to the costs of providing them;•changes in operating expenses;•organizational changes within the Company;•government regulation, legislation, or policies, including with respect to federal tax policy and international trade, such as recent tariffs and proposed tariffs on imports, and countermeasures by foreign governments;•the variability and timing of new business opportunities including acquisitions, customer relationships, and supplier authorizations;•the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions;•volatility of our stock price and the resulting impact on our consolidated financial statements; and changes in accounting policies and practices that could impact our financial reporting and increase compliance costs.10Table of Contents"
15,AIT,APPLIED INDUSTRIAL TECH INC,2017-08-18,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.In addition to other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.  The risks described below are not the only risks facing our Company.  Certain risks are identified below in Item 7 under the caption “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”  This information is incorporated here by reference.  Additional risks not currently known to us, risks that could apply broadly to issuers, or risks that we currently deem immaterial, may also impact our business and operations.  Risks can also change over time.Our business depends heavily on the operating levels of our customers and the factors that affect them, including general economic conditions.  The markets for the products and services we sell are subject to conditions or events that affect demand for goods and materials that our customers produce.  Consequently, demand for our products and services has been and will continue to be influenced by most of the same factors that affect demand for and production of customers' goods and materials.When customers or prospective customers reduce production levels because of lower demand, increased supply, higher costs, tight credit conditions, unfavorable currency exchange rates, adverse trade policies, foreign competition, other competitive disadvantage, offshoring of production, or other reasons, their need for our products and services diminishes.  Selling prices and terms of sale come under pressure, adversely affecting the profitability and the durability of customer relationships, and credit losses may increase.  Inventory management becomes more difficult in times of economic uncertainty.  Volatile economic and credit conditions also make it more difficult for us, as well as our customers and suppliers, to forecast and plan future business activities.Our business could be adversely affected if we do not successfully execute our initiatives to grow sales and earnings.  We have underway numerous initiatives to grow sales, enhance gross margins, manage costs, and otherwise improve our earnings. If we do not implement these initiatives effectively, or if for other reasons they are unsuccessful, our business could be adversely affected. Consolidation in our customers' and suppliers' industries could adversely affect our business and financial results. Consolidation continues among our product suppliers and customers.  As customers industries consolidate, a greater proportion of our sales could be derived from higher volume contracts, which could adversely impact 5Table of Contentsmargins.  Consolidation among customers can trigger changes in their purchasing strategies, potentially moving large blocks of business among competing distributors and contributing to volatility in our sales and pressure on prices.  Similarly, continued consolidation among our suppliers could reduce our ability to negotiate favorable pricing and other commercial terms for our inventory purchases.  There can be no assurance we will be able to take advantage of consolidation trends.Loss of key supplier authorizations, lack of product availability, or changes in distribution programs could adversely affect our sales and earnings.  Our business depends on maintaining an immediately available supply of various products to meet customer demand.  Many of our relationships with key product suppliers are longstanding, but are terminable by either party.  The loss of key supplier authorizations, or a substantial decrease in the availability of their products, could put us at a competitive disadvantage and have a material adverse effect on our business.  Supply interruptions could arise from raw materials shortages, inadequate manufacturing capacity or utilization to meet demand, financial problems, trade issues, labor disputes, or weather conditions affecting suppliers' production, transportation disruptions, or other reasons beyond our control.In addition, as a distributor, we face the risk of key product suppliers changing their relationships with distributors generally, or us in particular, in a manner that adversely impacts us.  For example, key suppliers could change the following: the prices we must pay for their products relative to other distributors or relative to competing products; the geographic or product line breadth of distributor authorizations; supplier purchasing incentive or other support programs; or product purchase or stocking expectations.An increase in competition could decrease sales or earnings. We operate in a highly competitive industry.  The industry remains fragmented, but is consolidating.  Our principal competitors are specialist and general line distributors of bearings, power transmission components, fluid power components and systems, industrial rubber products, linear motion components, tools, safety products, oilfield supplies, and other industrial and maintenance supplies.  These competitors include local, regional, national, and multinational operations, and can include catalog and e-commerce companies.  Competition is largely focused in the local service area and is generally based on product line breadth, product availability, service capabilities, and price.  Existing competitors have, and future competitors may have, greater financial or other resources than we do, broader product or service offerings, greater market presence, or better name recognition.  If existing or future competitors seek to gain or to retain market share by aggressive pricing strategies and sales methods, or otherwise through competitive advantage, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected.  Our success will also be affected by our ability to continue to provide competitive offerings as customer preferences or demands evolve, for example with respect to our product and services portfolio or our e-commerce and inventory management solutions.The purchasing incentives we earn from product suppliers can be impacted if we reduce our purchases in response to declining customer demand. Certain of our product suppliers have historically offered to their distributors, including us, incentives for purchasing their products.  In addition to market or customer account-specific incentives, certain suppliers pay incentives to the distributor for attaining specific purchase volumes during a program period.  In some cases, to earn incentives, we must achieve year-over-year growth in purchases with the supplier.  When demand for our products declines, we may be less inclined to add inventory to take advantage of certain incentive programs, thereby potentially adversely impacting our profitability.Changes in customer or product mix and downward pressure on sales prices could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline.  Because we serve thousands of customers in many end markets, and offer millions of products, with varying profitability levels, changes in our customer or product mix could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline.  Downward pressure on sales prices could also cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline.  We can experience downward pressure on sales prices as a result of deflation, pressure from customers to reduce costs, or increased competition.Our ability to transact business is highly reliant on information systems.  A disruption or security breach could materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operation.  We depend on information systems to process customer orders, manage inventory and accounts receivable collections, purchase products, manage accounts payable processes, ship products to customers on a timely basis, maintain cost-effective operations, provide superior service to customers, and compile financial results.  A serious, prolonged disruption of our information systems, due to manmade or natural causes, including power or telecommunications outage, or breach in security, could materially impair fundamental business processes and increase expenses, decrease sales, or otherwise reduce earnings.Because of our reliance on information systems, we may be vulnerable to the growing threat of damage or intrusion from computer viruses or other cyber-attacks on our systems.  Despite precautions taken to prevent or mitigate the risks of such incidents, an attack on our systems could not only cause business disruption, but could also result in the 6Table of Contentstheft or disclosure of proprietary or confidential information, or a breach of customers, supplier, or employee information.  Such an incident could negatively impact our sales, damage our reputation, and cause us to incur unanticipated legal liability and costs.In recent years, we replaced multiple legacy applications with an SAP software platform, to enhance our business information and transaction systems to support future growth.  We continue with and consider additional enterprise resource planning system conversions, on a smaller scale, in discrete business operations.  Despite extensive planning, we could experience disruptions related to the implementation because of the projects' complexity.  The potential adverse consequences could include delays, loss of information, diminished management reporting capabilities, damage to our ability to process transactions, harm to our control environment, diminished employee productivity and unanticipated increases in costs.  Further, our ability to achieve anticipated operational benefits from new platforms is not assured.Volatility in product and energy costs can affect our profitability.  Changes in costs of raw materials and energy can lead product manufacturers to adjust the prices of products we distribute.  In addition, a portion of our own distribution costs is comprised of fuel for our sales and delivery vehicles, freight, and utility expenses for our facilities.  Our ability to pass along increases in our product and distribution costs to our customers depends on market conditions.  Raising our prices could result in decreased sales volume, which could significantly reduce our profitability.  While increases in the cost of energy or products could be damaging to us, decreases in those costs, particularly if severe, could also adversely impact us by creating deflation in selling prices, which could cause our gross profit margin to deteriorate.  Changes in energy or raw materials costs can also adversely affect customers; for example, declines in oil, gas, and coal prices may negatively impact customers operating in those industries and, consequently, our sales to those customers.Acquisitions are a key component of our anticipated growth.  We may not be able to identify or to complete future acquisitions, to integrate them effectively into our operations, or to realize their anticipated benefits. Many industries we serve are mature.  As a result, acquisitions of businesses have been important to our growth.  While we wish to continue to acquire businesses, we may not be able to identify and to negotiate suitable acquisitions, to obtain financing for them on satisfactory terms, or otherwise to complete acquisitions.  In addition, existing or future competitors, or private equity firms, may increasingly seek to compete with us for acquisitions, which could increase prices and reduce the number of suitable opportunities.We seek acquisition opportunities that complement and expand our operations.  However, substantial costs, delays, or other difficulties related to integrating acquisitions could adversely affect our business or financial results.  We could face significant challenges in consolidating functions, integrating information systems, personnel, and operations, and implementing procedures and controls in a timely and efficient manner.Further, even if we successfully integrate the acquisitions with our operations, we may not be able to realize cost savings, sales, profit levels, or other benefits that we anticipate from these acquisitions, either as to amount or in the time frame we expect.  Our ability to realize anticipated benefits may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: our ability to achieve planned operating results, to reduce duplicative expenses and inventory effectively, and to consolidate facilities; economic and market factors; the incurrence of significant integration costs or charges in order to achieve those benefits; our ability to retain key product supplier authorizations, customer relationships, and employees; and our ability to address competitive, distribution, and regulatory challenges arising from entering into new markets, especially those in which we may have limited or no direct experience.  In addition, acquisitions could place significant demand on administrative, operational, and financial resources.Goodwill and other intangible assets recorded as a result of our acquisitions could become impaired.  We review long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and identifiable amortizing intangible assets, for impairment whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying amounts are not recoverable.  If the fair value is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference.  Factors which may cause an impairment of long-lived assets include significant changes in the manner of use of these assets, negative industry or market trends, a significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, or a likely sale or disposal of the asset before the end of its estimated useful life.  In 2016 we recorded a $64.8 million non-cash impairment charge for goodwill associated with the service center-based distribution reporting units in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.As of June 30, 2017, we had remaining $206.1 million of goodwill and $163.6 million of other intangible assets, net.  We assess all existing goodwill at least annually for impairment on a reporting unit basis.  The techniques used in our qualitative assessment and goodwill impairment tests incorporate a number of estimates and assumptions that are subject to change.  Although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and reflect market 7Table of Contentsconditions forecasted at the assessment date, any changes to these assumptions and estimates due to market conditions or otherwise may lead to an outcome where impairment charges would be required in future periods.Tight credit markets could impact our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms or increase the cost of future financing. Although the credit market turmoil of the financial crisis almost a decade ago did not have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity or borrowing costs, the availability of funds tightened and credit spreads on corporate debt increased.  If credit market volatility were to return, then obtaining additional or replacement financing could be more difficult and the cost of issuing new debt or replacing a credit facility could be higher than under our current facilities.  Tight credit conditions could limit our ability to finance acquisitions on terms acceptable to us.For more information relating to borrowing and interest rates, see the following sections below: “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7 under the caption “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations;” Item 7A under the caption “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk;” and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, included below in Item 8 under the caption “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”  That information is incorporated here by reference.Our ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting may be insufficient to allow us to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and this could cause our financial statements to become materially misleading and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.  We require effective internal control over financial reporting in order to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud.  Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud.  Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements.  If we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial statements and effectively prevent fraud, our financial statements could become materially misleading, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.If we are not able to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed.  Any material weakness could affect investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements.  As a result, our ability to obtain any additional financing, or additional financing on favorable terms, could be materially and adversely affected.  This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and the market value of our stock and require us to incur additional costs to improve our internal control systems and procedures.  In addition, perceptions of the Company among customers, suppliers, lenders, investors, securities analysts, and others could also be adversely affected.We cannot assure that any material weaknesses will not arise in the future due to our failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting.  In addition, although we have been successful historically in strengthening our controls and procedures, those controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or ensure the fair presentation of our financial statements included in our periodic reports filed with the SEC.Our business depends on our ability to attract, develop, motivate, and retain qualified employees.  Our success depends on hiring, developing, motivating, and retaining key employees, including executive, managerial, sales, professional, and other personnel.  We may have difficulty identifying and hiring qualified personnel.  In addition, we may have difficulty retaining such personnel once hired, and key people may leave and compete against us.  With respect to sales and customer service positions in particular, we greatly benefit from having employees who are familiar with the products we sell and their applications, as well as with our customer and supplier relationships.  The loss of key employees or our failure to attract and retain other qualified workers could disrupt or adversely affect our business.  In addition, our operating results could be adversely affected by increased competition for employees, shortages of qualified workers, higher employee turnover (including through retirement as the workforce ages), or increased employee compensation or benefit costs.An interruption of operations at our headquarters or distribution centers, or in our means of transporting product, could adversely impact our business. Our business depends on maintaining operating activity at our headquarters and distribution centers, and being able to receive and deliver product in a timely manner.  A serious, prolonged interruption due to power or telecommunications outage, terrorist attack, earthquake, extreme weather events, other natural disasters, fire, flood, or other interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.8Table of ContentsThere is no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock, and our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends.  The timing, declaration, amount, and payment of dividends to our shareholders fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors and depend on many factors, including our financial condition and results of operations, as well as applicable law and business considerations that our Board of Directors considers relevant.

There can be no assurance, however, that any such actions could be effected on satisfactory terms, if at all, or would be permitted by the terms of our debt or our other credit and contractual arrangements.Our operations outside the United States increase our exposure to global economic and political conditions and currency exchange volatility.  Foreign operations contributed 15.9% of our sales in 2017.  This presence outside the U.S. increases risks associated with exposure to more volatile economic conditions, political instability, cultural and legal differences in conducting business, (including corrupt practices), economic and trade policy actions, and currency exchange fluctuations.Our foreign operations' results are reported in the local currency and then translated into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements.  Fluctuations in currency exchange rates affect our operating results and financial position, as well as the comparability of results between financial periods.We are subject to litigation and regulatory risk due to the nature of our business, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.  From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings that arise from our business.

Additional risks not currently known to us, risks that could apply broadly to issuers, or risks that we currently deem immaterial, may also impact our business and operations.  Risks can also change over time.Our business depends heavily on the operating levels of our customers and the economic factors that affect them.  The markets for the products and services we sell are subject to conditions or events that affect demand for goods and materials that our customers produce.  Consequently, demand for our products and services has been and will continue to be influenced by most of the same economic factors that affect demand for and production of customers' goods and materials.When customers or prospective customers reduce production levels because of lower demand, increased supply, higher costs, tight credit conditions, unfavorable currency exchange rates, foreign competition, other competitive disadvantage, offshoring of production, or other reasons, their need for our products and services diminishes.  Selling prices and terms of sale come under pressure, adversely affecting the profitability and the durability of customer relationships, and credit losses may increase.  Inventory management becomes more difficult in times of 5Table of Contentseconomic uncertainty.  Volatile economic and credit conditions also make it more difficult for us, as well as our customers and suppliers, to forecast and plan future business activities.Consolidation in our customers' and suppliers' industries could adversely affect our business and financial results. Consolidation continues to occur among our product suppliers and customers.  As customers industries consolidate, a greater proportion of our sales could be derived from higher volume contracts, which could adversely impact margins.  Consolidation among customers can trigger changes in their purchasing strategies, potentially moving large blocks of business among competing distributors and contributing to volatility in our sales and pressure on prices.  Similarly, continued consolidation among our suppliers could reduce our ability to negotiate favorable pricing and other commercial terms for our inventory purchases.  There can be no assurance we will be able to take advantage of consolidation trends.Loss of key supplier authorizations, lack of product availability, or changes in distribution programs could adversely affect our sales and earnings. Our business depends on maintaining an immediately available supply of various products to meet customer demand.  Many of our relationships with key product suppliers are longstanding, but are terminable by either party.  The loss of key supplier authorizations, or a substantial decrease in the availability of their products, could put us at a competitive disadvantage and have a material adverse effect on our business.  Supply interruptions could arise from raw materials shortages, inadequate manufacturing capacity or utilization to meet demand, financial problems, trade issues, labor disputes, or weather conditions affecting suppliers' production, transportation disruptions, or other reasons beyond our control.In addition, as a distributor, we face the risk of key product suppliers changing their relationships with distributors generally, or Applied in particular, in a manner that adversely impacts us.  For example, key suppliers could change the following: the prices we must pay for their products relative to other distributors or relative to competing products; the geographic or product line breadth of distributor authorizations; supplier purchasing incentive or other support programs; or product purchase or stocking expectations.An increase in competition could decrease sales or earnings. We operate in a highly competitive industry.  The industry remains fragmented, but is consolidating.  Our competitors include local, regional, national, and multinational distributors of industrial machinery parts, equipment, and supplies.  Competition is largely focused in the local service area and is generally based on product line breadth, product availability, service capabilities, and price.  Existing competitors have, and future competitors may have, greater financial or other resources than we do, broader product or service offerings, greater market presence, or better name recognition.  If existing or future competitors seek to gain or to retain market share by aggressive pricing strategies and sales methods, or otherwise through competitive advantage, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected.  Our success will also be affected by our ability to continue to provide competitive offerings as customer preferences or demands evolve, for example with respect to our product portfolio or our e-commerce and inventory management solutions.The purchasing incentives we earn from product suppliers can be impacted if we reduce our purchases in response to declining customer demand. Certain of our product suppliers have historically offered to their distributors, including us, incentives for purchasing their products.  In addition to market or customer account-specific incentives, certain suppliers pay incentives to the distributor for attaining specific purchase volumes during the program period.  In some cases, in order to earn incentives, we must achieve year-over-year growth in purchases with the supplier.  When demand for our products declines, we may be less inclined to add inventory to take advantage of certain incentive programs, thereby potentially adversely impacting our profitability.Changes in customer or product mix and downward pressure on sales prices could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline.  Because we serve thousands of customers in many end markets, and offer millions of products, with varying profitability levels, changes in our customer or product mix could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline.  Downward pressure on sales prices could also cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline.  We can experience downward pressure on sales prices as a result of deflation, pressure from customers to reduce costs, or increased competition.Our ability to transact business is highly reliant on information systems.  A disruption or security breach could materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operation. We depend on information systems to process customer orders, manage inventory and accounts receivable collections, purchase products, manage accounts payable processes, ship products to customers on a timely basis, maintain cost-effective operations, provide superior service to customers, and accumulate financial results.  A serious, prolonged disruption of our information systems, due to manmade or natural causes, or breach in security, could materially impair fundamental business processes and increase expenses, decrease sales, or otherwise reduce earnings.6Table of ContentsBecause of our reliance on information systems, we may be vulnerable to the growing threat of damage or intrusion from computer viruses or other cyber-attacks on our systems.  Despite precautions taken to prevent or mitigate the risks of such incidents, an attack on our systems could not only cause business disruption, but could also result in the theft or disclosure of proprietary or confidential information, or a breach of customers, supplier, or employee information.  Such an incident could negatively impact our sales, damage our reputation, and cause us to incur unanticipated legal liability and costs.In recent years, we replaced multiple legacy applications with an SAP software platform, to enhance our business information and transaction systems to support future growth.

The potential adverse consequences could include delays, loss of information, diminished management reporting capabilities, damage to our ability to process transactions, harm to our control environment, diminished employee productivity and unanticipated increases in costs.  Further, our ability to achieve anticipated operational benefits from new platforms is not assured. Volatility in product and energy costs can affect our profitability.  Changes in costs of raw materials and energy can lead product manufacturers to adjust the prices of products we distribute.  In addition, a portion of our own distribution costs is comprised of fuel for our sales and delivery vehicles, freight, and utility expenses for our facilities.  Our ability to pass along increases in our product and distribution costs to our customers depends on market conditions.  Raising our prices could result in decreased sales volume, which could significantly reduce our profitability.  While increases in the cost of energy or products could be damaging to us, decreases in those costs, particularly if severe, could also adversely impact us by creating deflation in selling prices, which could cause our gross profit margin to deteriorate.  Changes in energy or raw materials costs can also adversely affect customers; for example, declines in oil and gas prices negatively impacted customers operating in those industries and, consequently, our sales to those customers.Acquisitions are a key component of our anticipated growth.  We may not be able to identify or to complete future acquisitions, to integrate them effectively into our operations, or to realize their anticipated benefits. Many industries we serve are mature.  As a result, acquisitions of businesses have been important to our growth.

However, substantial costs, delays, or other difficulties related to integrating acquisitions could adversely affect our business or financial results.  We could face significant challenges in consolidating functions, integrating information systems, personnel, and operations, and implementing  procedures and controls in a timely and efficient manner.Further, even if we successfully integrate the acquisitions with our operations, we may not be able to realize cost savings, sales, profit levels, or other benefits that we anticipate from these acquisitions, either as to amount or in the time frame we expect.  Our ability to realize anticipated benefits may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: our ability to achieve planned operating results, to reduce duplicative expenses and inventory effectively, and to consolidate facilities; economic and market factors; the incurrence of significant integration costs or charges in order to achieve those benefits; our ability to retain key product supplier authorizations, customer relationships, and employees; and our ability to address competitive, distribution, and regulatory challenges arising from entering into new markets, especially those in which we may have limited or no direct experience.  In addition, acquisitions could place significant demand on administrative, operational, and financial resources.Goodwill and other intangible assets recorded as a result of our acquisitions could become impaired.      We review long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and identifiable amortizing intangible assets, for impairment whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying amounts are not recoverable.  If the fair value is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference.  Factors which may cause an impairment of long-lived assets include significant changes in the manner of use of these assets, negative industry or market trends, a significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, or a likely sale or disposal of the asset before the end of its estimated useful life.  In 2016 we recorded a $64.8 million non-cash impairment charge for goodwill associated with the service center-based distribution reporting units in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.As of June 30, 2016, we had remaining $202.7 million of goodwill and $191.2 million of other intangible assets, net.  We assess all existing goodwill at least annually for impairment on a reporting unit basis.  The techniques used 7Table of Contentsin our qualitative assessment and goodwill impairment tests incorporate a number of estimates and assumptions that are subject to change.  Although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and reflect market conditions forecasted at the assessment date, any changes to these assumptions and estimates due to market conditions or otherwise may lead to an outcome where impairment charges would be required in future periods.Tight credit markets could impact our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms or increase the cost of future financing. Although the credit market turmoil of several years ago did not have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity or borrowing costs, the availability of funds tightened and credit spreads on corporate debt increased.  If credit market volatility were to return, then obtaining additional or replacement financing could be more difficult and the cost of issuing new debt or replacing a credit facility could be higher than under our current facilities.  Tight credit conditions could limit our ability to finance acquisitions on terms acceptable to us.For more information relating to borrowing and interest rates, see the following sections below: “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7 under the caption “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations;” Item 7A under the caption “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk;” and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, included below in Item 8 under the caption “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”  That information is incorporated here by reference.Our ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting may be insufficient to allow us to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and this could cause our financial statements to become materially misleading and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. We require effective internal control over financial reporting in order to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud.  Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud.  Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements.  If we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial statements and effectively prevent fraud, our financial statements could become materially misleading, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. If we are not able to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed.  Any material weakness could affect investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements.  As a result, our ability to obtain any additional financing, or additional financing on favorable terms, could be materially and adversely affected.  This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and the market value of our stock and require us to incur additional costs to improve our internal control systems and procedures.  In addition, perceptions of the Company among customers, suppliers, lenders, investors, securities analysts, and others could also be adversely affected.We can give no assurances that any material weaknesses will not arise in the future due to our failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting.  In addition, although we have been successful historically in strengthening our controls and procedures, those controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or ensure the fair presentation of our financial statements included in our periodic reports filed with the SEC.There is no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock, and our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends. The timing, declaration, amount, and payment of dividends to our shareholders fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors and depend on many factors, including our financial condition and results of operations, as well as applicable law and business considerations that our Board of Directors considers relevant.  There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay a quarterly dividend.Additionally, if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our debt payment obligations, then our ability to pay dividends, if so determined by the Board of Directors, will be impaired and we may be required to attempt to restructure or refinance our debt, raise additional capital, or take other actions such as selling assets, reducing, or delaying capital expenditures, or reducing our dividend.  There can be no assurance, however, that any such actions could be effected on satisfactory terms, if at all, or would be permitted by the terms of our debt or our other credit and contractual arrangements. Our growth outside the United States increases our exposure to global economic and political conditions and currency exchange volatility.  Foreign operations contributed 16.0% of our sales in 2016.  If we continue to grow outside the U.S., risks associated with exposure to more volatile economic conditions, political instability, 8Table of Contentscultural and legal differences in conducting business, (including corrupt practices), and currency exchange fluctuations will increase.Our foreign operations' results are reported in the local currency and then translated into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements.  Fluctuations in currency exchange rates affect our operating results and financial position and affect the comparability of results between financial periods.Our business depends on our ability to attract, develop, motivate, and retain qualified employees.  Our success depends on hiring, developing, motivating, and retaining key employees, including executive, managerial, sales, professional, and other personnel.  We may have difficulty identifying and hiring qualified personnel.  In addition, we may have difficulty retaining such personnel once hired, and key people may leave and compete against us.  With respect to sales and customer service positions in particular, we greatly benefit from having employees who are familiar with the products we sell and their applications, as well as with our customer and supplier relationships.  The loss of key employees or our failure to attract and retain other qualified workers could disrupt or adversely affect our business.  In addition, our operating results could be adversely affected by increased competition for employees, shortages of qualified workers, higher employee turnover (including through retirement as the workforce ages), or increased employee compensation or benefit costs.An interruption of operations at our headquarters or distribution centers, or in our means of transporting product, could adversely impact our business. Our business depends on maintaining operating activity at our headquarters and distribution centers, and being able to receive and deliver product in a timely manner.  A serious, prolonged interruption due to power or telecommunications outage, terrorist attack, earthquake, extreme weather events, other natural disasters, fire, flood, or other interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.We are subject to litigation and regulatory risk due to the nature of our business, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.  From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings that arise from our business.  These may, for example, relate to product liability claims, commercial disputes, personal injuries, or employment-related matters.  In addition, we could face claims over other matters, such as claims arising from our status as a public company or government contractor, or otherwise relating to our compliance with a wide array of laws and regulations to which we are subject.  The defense and ultimate outcome of lawsuits or other legal proceedings or inquiries may result in higher operating expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.Our business is subject to risks, some for which we maintain third-party insurance and some for which we self-insure.  We may incur losses and be subject to liability claims that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.  We maintain insurance policies that provide limited coverage for some, but not all, of the potential risks and liabilities associated with our business.  The policies are subject to deductibles and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a self-insured basis.  For some risks, we may not obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented.  Because of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially, and in some instances, certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage.  As a result, we may not be able to renew existing insurance policies or procure other desirable insurance on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.  Even where insurance coverage applies, insurers may contest their obligations to make payments.  Our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by losses and liabilities from uninsured or under-insured events, as well as by delays in the payment of insurance proceeds, or the failure by insurers to make payments. In addition to the risks identified above, other risks to our future performance include, but are not limited to, the following:changes in customer preferences for products and services of the nature, brands, quality,   or cost sold by us;changes in customer procurement policies and practices;changes in the market prices for products and services relative to the costs of providing them;changes in operating expenses;organizational changes within the Company;adverse regulation and legislation, both enacted and under consideration, including with respect to   federal tax policy (e.g., affecting the use of the LIFO inventory accounting method and the taxation of   foreign-sourced income);the variability and timing of new business opportunities including acquisitions, customer relationships, and supplier authorizations;9Table of Contentsthe incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions;volatility of our stock price and the resulting impact on our consolidated financial statements; andchanges in accounting policies and practices that could impact our financial reporting and increase   compliance costs"
1,AIT,APPLIED INDUSTRIAL TECH INC,2015-08-26,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.In addition to other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.  The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company.  Certain risks are identified below in Item 7 under the caption “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”  This information is incorporated here by reference.  Additional risks not currently known to us, risks that could apply broadly to issuers, or risks that we currently deem immaterial, may also impact our business and operations.Our business depends heavily on the operating levels of our customers and the economic factors that affect them.  The markets for the products and services we sell are subject to conditions or events that affect demand for goods and materials that our customers produce.  Consequently, demand for our products and services has been and will continue to be influenced by most of the same economic factors that affect demand for and production of customers' goods and materials.5Table of ContentsWhen customers or prospective customers reduce production levels because of lower demand, increased supply, higher costs, tight credit conditions, unfavorable currency exchange rates, foreign competition, other competitive disadvantage, offshoring of production or other reasons, their need for our products and services diminishes.  Selling prices and terms of sale come under pressure, adversely affecting the profitability and the durability of customer relationships, and credit losses may increase.  Inventory management becomes more difficult in times of economic uncertainty.  Volatile economic and credit conditions also make it more difficult for us, as well as our customers and suppliers, to forecast and plan future business activities.Consolidation in our customers' and suppliers' industries could adversely affect our business and financial results. In recent years, we have witnessed consolidation among our product suppliers and customers.  As customers industries consolidate, a greater proportion of our sales could be derived from higher volume contracts, which could adversely impact margins.  Consolidation among customers can trigger changes in their purchasing strategies, potentially moving large blocks of business among competing distributors and contributing to volatility in our sales and pressure on prices.  Similarly, continued consolidation among our suppliers could reduce our ability to negotiate favorable pricing and other commercial terms for our inventory purchases.  There can be no assurance we will be able to adequately take advantage of the consolidation trend.Loss of key supplier authorizations, lack of product availability, or changes in supplier distribution programs could adversely affect our sales and earnings. Our business depends on maintaining an immediately available supply of various products to meet customer demand.  Many of our relationships with key product suppliers are longstanding, but are terminable by either party.  The loss of key supplier authorizations, or a substantial decrease in the availability of their products, could put us at a competitive disadvantage and have a material adverse effect on our business.  Supply interruptions could arise from raw materials shortages, inadequate manufacturing capacity or utilization to meet demand, financial problems, labor disputes or weather conditions affecting suppliers' production, transportation disruptions, or other reasons beyond our control.In addition, as a distributor, we face the risk of key product suppliers changing their relationships with distributors generally, or Applied in particular, in a manner that adversely impacts us.  For example, key suppliers could change the following: the prices we must pay for their products relative to other distributors or relative to competing products; the geographic or product line breadth of distributor authorizations; supplier purchasing incentive or other support programs; or product purchase or stocking expectations.An increase in competition could decrease sales or earnings. We operate in a highly competitive industry.  Our competitors include local, regional, national, and multinational distributors of industrial machinery parts, equipment, and supplies.  Competition is largely focused in the local service area and is generally based on product line breadth, product availability, service capabilities, and price.  Some existing competitors have, and potential market entrants may have, greater financial or other resources than we do, broader product or service offerings, greater market presence, or better name recognition.  If existing or future competitors seek to gain or to retain market share by aggressive pricing strategies and sales methods, we may need to lower our prices for products or services, or increase our spending, thereby adversely affecting financial results.  Our success will also be affected by our ability to continue to provide competitive offerings as customer preferences or demands evolve, for example with respect to our product portfolio or our e-commerce and inventory management solutions.The purchasing incentives we earn from product suppliers can be impacted if we reduce our purchases in response to declining customer demand. Certain of our product suppliers have historically offered to their distributors, including us, incentives for purchasing their products.  In addition to market or customer account-specific incentives, certain suppliers pay incentives to the distributor for attaining specific purchase volumes during the program period.  In some cases, in order to earn incentives, we must achieve year-over-year growth in purchases with the supplier.  When demand for our products declines, we may be less willing to add inventory to take advantage of certain incentive programs, thereby potentially adversely impacting our profitability.Changes in customer or product mix and downward pressure on sales prices could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline.  Because we serve thousands of customers in many end markets, and offer millions of products, with varying profitability levels, changes in our customer or product mix could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline.  Downward pressure on sales prices could also cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline.  We can experience downward pressure on sales prices as a result of deflation, pressure from customers to reduce costs, or increased competition.Our ability to transact business is highly reliant on information systems.  A disruption or security breach could materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operation. We depend on information systems to process customer orders, manage inventory and accounts receivable collections, purchase products, manage accounts payable processes, ship products to customers on a timely basis, maintain cost-effective operations, provide 6Table of Contentssuperior service to customers, and accumulate financial results.  A serious, prolonged disruption of our information systems, due to manmade or natural causes, or breach in security, could materially impair fundamental business processes and increase expenses, decrease sales, or otherwise reduce earnings.Because of our reliance on information systems, we may be vulnerable to the growing threat of damage or intrusion from computer viruses or other cyber-attacks on our systems.  Despite precautions taken to prevent or mitigate the risks of such incidents, an attack on our systems could not only cause business disruption, but could also result in the theft or disclosure of proprietary or confidential information, or a breach of customers, supplier, or employee information.  Such an incident could negatively impact our sales, damage our reputation, and cause us to incur unanticipated legal liability and costs.We recently replaced multiple legacy applications in our service center-based distribution business with an SAP software platform, to enhance our business information and transaction systems to support future growth.  Our ability to achieve anticipated operational benefits from the new platform is not assured.Volatility in product and energy costs can affect our profitability. Changes in costs of raw materials and energy can lead product manufacturers to adjust the prices of products we distribute.  In addition, a portion of our own distribution costs is comprised of fuel for our sales and delivery vehicles, freight, and utility expenses for our facilities.  Our ability to pass along increases in our product and distribution costs to our customers depends on market conditions.  Raising our prices could result in decreased sales volume, which could significantly reduce our profitability.  While increases in the cost of energy or products could be damaging to us, decreases in those costs, particularly if severe, could also adversely impact us by creating deflation in selling prices, which could cause our gross profit margin to deteriorate.  Changes in energy or raw materials costs can also adversely affect customers; for example, recent declines in oil and gas prices have negatively impacted customers operating in those industries and, consequently, our sales to those customers.Acquisitions are a key component of our anticipated growth.  We may not be able to identify or to complete future acquisitions, to integrate them effectively into our operations, or to realize their anticipated benefits. Many industries we serve are mature.  As a result, acquisitions of businesses have been important to our growth in recent years.  While we wish to continue to acquire businesses, we may not be able to identify and to negotiate suitable acquisitions, to obtain financing for them on satisfactory terms, or otherwise to complete acquisitions.  In addition, existing or future competitors may increasingly seek to compete with us for acquisitions, which could increase prices and reduce the number of suitable opportunities.We seek acquisition opportunities that complement and expand our operations.  However, substantial costs, delays, or other difficulties related to integrating acquisitions into our operations could adversely affect our business or financial results.  We could face significant challenges in consolidating functions and integrating procedures, information systems, personnel, and operations in a timely and efficient manner.Further, even if we successfully integrate the acquisitions with our operations, we may not be able to realize cost savings, sales, profit levels, or other benefits that we anticipate from these acquisitions, either as to amount or in the time frame we expect.  Our ability to realize anticipated benefits may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: our ability to achieve planned operating results, to reduce duplicative expenses and inventory effectively, and to consolidate facilities; economic and market factors; the incurrence of significant integration costs or charges in order to achieve those benefits; our ability to retain key product supplier authorizations, customer relationships, and employees; and our ability to address competitive, distribution, and regulatory challenges arising from entering into new markets, especially those in which we may have limited or no direct experience.  In addition, acquisitions could place significant demand on administrative, operational, and financial resources.Goodwill and other intangible assets recorded as a result of our acquisitions could become impaired.  We review long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and identifiable amortizing intangible assets, for impairment whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying amounts are not recoverable.  If the fair value is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference.  Factors which may cause an impairment of long-lived assets include significant changes in the manner of use of these assets, negative industry or market trends, a significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, or a likely sale or disposal of the asset before the end of its estimated useful life.As of June 30, 2015, we had $254.4 million of goodwill.  We assess all existing goodwill at least annually for impairment on a reporting unit basis.  The techniques used in our qualitative assessment and goodwill impairment tests incorporate a number of estimates and assumptions that are subject to change.  Although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and reflect market conditions forecast at the assessment date, any 7Table of Contentschanges to these assumptions and estimates due to market conditions or otherwise may lead to an outcome where impairment charges would be required in future periods.Tight credit markets could impact our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms or increase the cost of future financing. Although the credit market turmoil of several years ago did not have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity or borrowing costs, the availability of funds tightened and credit spreads on corporate debt increased.  If credit market volatility were to return, then obtaining additional or replacement financing could be more difficult and the cost of issuing new debt or replacing a credit facility could be higher than under our current facilities.  Tight credit conditions could limit our ability to finance acquisitions on terms acceptable to us.For more information relating to borrowing and interest rates, see the following sections below: “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7 under the caption “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations;” Item 7A under the caption “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk;” and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, included below in Item 8 under the caption “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”  That information is incorporated here by reference.Our ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting may be insufficient to allow us to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and this could cause our financial statements to become materially misleading and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.  We require effective internal control over financial reporting in order to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud.

As a result, our ability to obtain any additional financing, or additional financing on favorable terms, could be materially and adversely affected.  This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and the market value of our stock and require us to incur additional costs to improve our internal control systems and procedures.  In addition, perceptions of the company among customers, suppliers, lenders, investors, securities analysts, and others could also be adversely affected.We can give no assurances that any material weaknesses will not arise in the future due to our failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting.  In addition, although we have been successful historically in strengthening our controls and procedures, those controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or ensure the fair presentation of our financial statements included in our periodic reports filed with the SEC.There is no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock, and our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends.  The timing, declaration, amount, and payment of dividends to our shareholders fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors and depend on many factors, including our financial condition and results of operations, as well as applicable law and business considerations that our Board of Directors considers relevant.

There can be no assurance, however, that any such actions could be effected on satisfactory terms, if at all, or would be permitted by the terms of our debt or our other credit and contractual arrangements. Our growth outside the United States increases our exposure to global economic and political conditions and currency exchange volatility. Foreign operations contributed 18.7% of our sales in 2015.  If we continue to grow outside the U.S., the risks associated with exposure to more volatile economic conditions, political instability, cultural and legal differences in conducting business, and currency exchange fluctuations will increase.8Table of ContentsOur foreign operations' results are reported in the local currency and then translated into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements.  Fluctuations in currency exchange rates affect our operating results and financial position and affect the comparability of results between financial periods.Our business depends on our ability to attract, develop, motivate, and retain qualified employees.

RISK FACTORS.In addition to other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.  The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company.  Certain risks are identified below in Item 7 under the caption “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”  This information is incorporated here by reference.  Additional risks not currently known to us, risks that could apply broadly to issuers, or risks that we currently deem immaterial, may also impact our business and operations.Our business depends heavily on the operating levels of our customers and the economic factors that affect them.  Many of the primary markets for the products and services we sell are subject to cyclical fluctuations that affect demand for goods and materials that our customers produce.  Consequently, demand for our products and services has been and will continue to be influenced by most of the same economic factors that affect demand for and production of customers' goods and materials.When customers or prospective customers reduce production levels because of lower demand or tight credit conditions, their need for our products and services diminishes.  Selling prices and terms of sale come under pressure, adversely affecting the profitability and the durability of customer relationships, and credit losses increase too. Volatile economic and credit conditions also make it more difficult for distributors, as well as customers and suppliers, to forecast and plan future business activities.Consolidation in our customers' and suppliers' industries could adversely affect our business and financial results. In recent years, we have witnessed consolidation among our product suppliers and customers. As customer industries consolidate, a greater proportion of our sales could be derived from higher volume contracts, which could adversely impact the amount and volatility of our earnings. Consolidation among customers can trigger changes in their purchasing strategies, potentially moving large blocks of business among competing industrial distributors and contributing to volatility in our sales and pressure on prices. Similarly, continued consolidation among our suppliers could reduce our ability to negotiate favorable pricing and other commercial terms for our inventory purchases.Loss of key supplier authorizations, lack of product availability, or changes in supplier distribution programs could adversely affect our sales and earnings.

When demand for our products declines, we may be less willing to add inventory to take advantage of certain incentive programs, thereby potentially adversely impacting our profitability.Our ability to transact business is highly reliant on our information systems.  We face additional risks in this regard as we implement a new integrated information technology platform for our business. We depend on information systems to process customer orders, manage inventory and accounts receivable collections, purchase products, manage accounts payable processes, ship products to customers on a timely basis, maintain cost-effective operations, provide superior service to customers, and accumulate financial results.  A serious, prolonged disruption of our information systems or breach in security could materially impair fundamental business processes and increase expenses, decrease sales, or otherwise reduce earnings.We are completing the process of replacing multiple legacy applications with an SAP software platform, to enhance our business information and transaction systems to support future growth.  The implementation has occurred over several years in planned phases, primarily based on geographic region; as of June 30, 2014, a substantial majority of our service center operations in the U.S. and Canada were using SAP.  We have also begun the transformation of our financial and accounting systems including fixed assets, general ledger and consolidation systems.  These implementations are expected to continue through fiscal 2015.  Despite extensive planning, we could experience disruptions in our business operations related to the implementation because of the project's complexity.   The potential material adverse consequences could include delays, loss of information, diminished management reporting capabilities, damage to our ability to process transactions, harm to our control environment, diminished employee productivity, and unanticipated increases in costs. Further, our ability to achieve anticipated operational benefits from the new platform is not assured.Volatility in product and energy costs can affect our profitability. Cost increases in commodity resources, such as steel and energy, can lead product manufacturers to increase the prices of products we distribute.  In addition, a portion of our own distribution costs is comprised of fuel for our sales and delivery vehicles, freight, and utility expenses for our facilities.  Our ability to pass along to customers the increases in our product and distribution costs depends on market conditions.  Raising our prices could result in decreased sales volume, which could significantly reduce our profitability.  When costs fall, market prices can fall too, again potentially affecting profitability.Acquisitions are a key component of our anticipated growth.  We may not be able to identify or to complete future acquisitions, to integrate them effectively into our operations, or to realize their anticipated benefits. Many industries we serve are mature.  As a result, acquisitions of other businesses have been important to our growth in recent years.  While we wish to continue to acquire businesses, we may not be able to identify and to negotiate suitable acquisitions, to obtain financing for them on satisfactory terms, or otherwise to complete acquisitions.   In addition, existing or future competitors may increasingly seek to compete with us for acquisitions, which could have the effect of increasing the price and reducing the number of suitable opportunities.We seek acquisition opportunities that complement and expand our operations.  However, substantial costs, delays, or other difficulties related to integrating acquisitions into our operations could adversely affect our business or financial results.  We could face significant challenges in consolidating functions and integrating procedures, information systems, personnel, and operations in a timely and efficient manner.Further, even if we successfully integrate the acquisitions with our operations, we may not be able to realize the cost savings, sales, profit levels, or other benefits that we anticipate from these acquisitions, either as to amount or in the time frame we expect.  Our ability to realize anticipated benefits may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: our ability to achieve planned operating results, to reduce duplicative expenses and inventory effectively, and to consolidate facilities; the incurrence of significant integration costs or charges in order to achieve those benefits; and our ability to retain key product supplier authorizations, customer relationships, and employees. In addition, acquisitions could place significant demand on administrative, operational, and financial resources.Tight credit markets could impact our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms or increase the cost of future financing. Although the credit market turmoil of several years ago did not have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity or borrowing costs, the availability of funds tightened and credit spreads on corporate debt increased.  If credit market volatility were to return, then obtaining additional or replacement financing could be more difficult and the cost of issuing new debt or replacing a credit facility could be higher than under our current facilities.  Tight credit conditions could limit our ability to finance acquisitions on terms acceptable to us.7Table of ContentsFor more information relating to borrowing and interest rates, see the following sections below: “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7 under the caption “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations;” Item 7A under the caption “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk;” and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, included below in Item 8 under the caption “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”  That information is incorporated here by reference.Our growth outside the United States increases our exposure to global economic and political conditions. Foreign operations contributed 17.4% of our sales in 2014.  If we continue to grow outside the U.S., the risks associated with exposure to more volatile economic conditions, political instability, cultural and legal differences in conducting business, and currency fluctuations will increase.Our business depends on our ability to attract, develop, motivate, and retain qualified sales and customer service personnel and other skilled managers and professionals. There are significant costs associated with recruiting, training, and developing skilled employees.  With respect to sales and customer service positions, we greatly benefit from having employees who are familiar with the products we sell and their applications, as well as with our customer and supplier relationships.  We could be adversely affected by a shortage of, or increased competition for, available skilled workers, or by the loss of a significant number of our sales and customer service personnel or other managers or professionals, including through retirement as the workforce ages.An interruption of operations at our headquarters or distribution centers could adversely impact our business. Our business depends on maintaining operations at our headquarters and distribution centers.  A serious, prolonged interruption due to power outage, telecommunications outage, terrorist attack, earthquake, extreme weather events, other natural disasters, fire, flood, or other interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.We are subject to litigation and regulatory risk due to the nature of our business, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.  From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings that arise from our business.  These may, for example, relate to product liability claims, commercial disputes, personal injuries, or employment-related matters.  In addition, we could face claims over other matters, such as claims arising from our status as a public company or government contractor, or otherwise relating to our compliance with a wide array of laws and regulations to which we are subject.  The defense and ultimate outcome of lawsuits or other legal proceedings or inquiries may result in higher operating expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on   our business, financial condition, or results of operations.In addition to the risks identified above, other risks to our future performance include, but are not limited to,  the following:changes in customer preferences for products and services of the nature, brands, quality,   or cost sold by Applied;changes in customer procurement policies and practices;changes in the market prices for products and services relative to the costs of providing them;changes in operating expenses;organizational changes within the company;adverse regulation and legislation, both enacted and under consideration, including with respect to   federal tax policy (e.g., affecting the use of the LIFO inventory accounting method and the taxation of   foreign-sourced income);the variability and timing of new business opportunities including acquisitions, alliances,   customer relationships, and supplier authorizations;the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions;volatility of our stock price and the resulting impact on our consolidated financial statements; andchanges in accounting policies and practices that could impact our financial reporting and increase   compliance costs"

RISK FACTORS.In addition to other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Certain risks are identified in “Management's Discussion and Analysis” in Applied's 2013 annual report to shareholders and that information is incorporated here by reference. Additional risks not currently known to us, risks that could apply broadly to issuers, or risks that we currently deem immaterial, may also impact our business and operations.     Our business depends heavily on the operating levels of our customers and the economic factors that affect them. Many of the primary markets for the products and services we sell are subject to cyclical fluctuations that affect demand for goods and materials that our customers produce. Consequently, demand for our products and services has been and will continue to be influenced by most of the same economic factors that affect demand for and production of customers' goods and materials. When customers or prospective customers reduce production levels because of lower demand or tight credit conditions, their need for our products and services diminishes. Selling prices and terms of sale come under pressure, adversely affecting the profitability and the durability of customer relationships, and credit losses increase too. Volatile economic and credit conditions also make it more difficult for distributors, as well as customers and suppliers, to forecast and plan future business activities.8Table of ContentsIn addition, our industry confronts a longer-term secular trend of manufacturing customers moving production to lower-cost countries to reduce costs. Our ability to continue to serve such customers may be impaired and the size of our overall opportunity in the markets we serve could be adversely affected.Consolidation in our customers' and suppliers' industries could adversely affect our business and financial results. In recent years, we have witnessed consolidation among our product suppliers and customers. As customer industries consolidate, a greater proportion of our sales could be derived from higher volume contracts, which could adversely impact the amount and volatility of our earnings. Consolidation among customers can trigger changes in their purchasing strategies, potentially moving large blocks of business among competing industrial distributors and contributing to volatility in our sales and pressure on prices. Similarly, continued consolidation among our suppliers could reduce our ability to negotiate favorable pricing and other commercial terms for our inventory purchases.     Loss of key supplier authorizations, lack of product availability, or changes in supplier distribution programs could adversely affect our sales and earnings. Our business depends on maintaining an immediately available supply of various products to meet customer demand. Many of our relationships with key product suppliers are longstanding, but are terminable by either party. The loss of key supplier authorizations, or a substantial decrease in the availability of their products, could put us at a competitive disadvantage and have a material adverse effect on our business. Supply interruptions could arise from raw materials shortages, inadequate manufacturing capacity or utilization to meet demand, financial problems, labor disputes or weather conditions affecting suppliers' production, transportation disruptions, or other reasons beyond our control. In addition, as a distributor, we face the risk of key product suppliers changing their relationships with distributors generally, or Applied in particular, in a manner that adversely impacts us. For example, key suppliers could change the following: the prices we must pay for their products relative to other distributors or relative to competing products; the geographic or product line breadth of distributor authorizations; supplier purchasing incentive or other support programs; or product purchase or stocking expectations.     An increase in competition could decrease sales or earnings. We operate in a highly competitive industry. Our competitors include local, regional, national, and multinational distributors of industrial machinery parts, equipment, and supplies. Competition is largely focused in the local service area and is generally based on product line breadth, product availability, service capabilities, and price. Some existing competitors have, and potential market entrants may have, greater financial or other resources than we do, or broader product or service offerings. If existing or future competitors seek to gain or to retain market share by reducing prices, we may need to lower our prices for products or services, thereby adversely affecting financial results.     The purchasing incentives we earn from product suppliers can be impacted if we reduce our purchases in response to declining customer demand. Certain of our product suppliers have historically offered to their distributors, including us, incentives for purchasing their products. In addition to market or customer account-specific incentives, certain suppliers pay incentives to the distributor for attaining specific purchase volumes during the program period. In some cases, in order to earn incentives, we must achieve year-over-year growth in purchases with the supplier. When demand for our products declines, we may be less willing to add inventory to take advantage of certain incentive programs, thereby potentially adversely impacting our profitability.      Our ability to transact business is highly reliant on our information systems. We face additional risks in this regard as we implement a new integrated information technology platform for our business. We depend on information systems to process customer orders, manage inventory and accounts receivable collections, purchase products, manage accounts payable processes, ship products to customers on a timely basis, maintain cost-effective operations, provide superior service to customers, and accumulate financial results. A serious, prolonged disruption of our information systems or breach in security could materially impair fundamental business processes and increase expenses, decrease sales, or otherwise reduce earnings.We are in the process of replacing multiple legacy applications with an SAP software platform, to enhance our business information and transaction systems to support future growth. The implementation is occurring over several years in planned phases, primarily based on geographic region; as of June 30, 2013, portions of our 9Table of Contentsoperations in the U.S. and Canada were on SAP. The process is technically intensive, requiring design, testing, modifications, training, and project coordination. Despite extensive planning, we could experience disruptions in our business operations related to the implementation because of the project's complexity. The potential material adverse consequences could include delays, loss of information, diminished management reporting capabilities, damage to our ability to process transactions, harm to our control environment (including during the transition period of operating on two systems), diminished employee productivity, and unanticipated increases in costs. Further, our ability to achieve anticipated operational benefits from the new platform is not assured.     Volatility in product and energy costs can affect our profitability. In the last decade, cost increases in commodity resources, such as steel and energy, led product manufacturers to increase the prices of products we distribute. In addition, a portion of our own distribution costs is comprised of fuel for our sales and delivery vehicles, freight, and utility expenses for our facilities. These costs have fluctuated significantly in recent years. Our ability to pass along to customers the increases in our costs depends on market conditions. Raising our prices could result in decreased sales volume, which could significantly reduce our profitability. When costs fall, market prices can fall too, again potentially affecting profitability.     Future acquisitions are a key component of our anticipated growth. We may not be able to identify or to complete future acquisitions, to integrate them effectively into our operations, or to realize their anticipated benefits. Many industries we serve are mature. As a result, acquisitions of other businesses have been important to our growth in recent years. While we wish to continue to acquire businesses, we may not be able to identify and to negotiate suitable acquisitions, to obtain financing for them on satisfactory terms, or otherwise to complete acquisitions.

In addition, future acquisitions could place significant demand on administrative, operational, and financial resources.     Tight credit markets could impact our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms or increase the cost of future financing.

All of these costs have fluctuated significantly in recent years. Our ability to passalong to customers the increases in our costs depends on market conditions. Raising our pricescould result in decreased sales volume, which could significantly reduce our profitability. Whencosts fall, market prices can fall too, again potentially affecting profitability.     Future acquisitions are a key component of our anticipated growth. We may not be able toidentify or to complete future acquisitions, to integrate them effectively into our operations, orto realize their anticipated benefits. Many industries we serve are mature. As a result, ourgrowth in recent years has resulted substantially from the acquisition of other businesses. Whilewe wish to continue to acquire businesses, we may not be able to identify and to negotiate suitableacquisitions, to obtain financing for them on satisfactory terms, or otherwise to completeacquisitions. In addition, existing or future competitors may increasingly seek to compete with usfor acquisitions, which could have the effect of increasing the price and reducing the number ofsuitable opportunities.     We seek acquisition opportunities that complement and expand our operations. However,substantial costs, delays, or other difficulties related to integrating acquisitions into ouroperations could adversely affect our business or financial results. We could face significantchallenges in consolidating functions and integrating procedures, information systems, personnel,and operations in a timely and efficient manner.     Further, even if we successfully integrate the acquisitions with our operations, we may not beable to realize the cost savings, sales increases, or other benefits that we anticipate from12 these acquisitions, either as to amount or in the time frame we expect. Our ability to realizeanticipated benefits may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: our abilityto reduce duplicative expenses and inventory effectively, and to consolidate facilities; theincurrence of significant integration costs or charges in order to achieve those benefits; and ourability to retain key product supplier authorizations, customer relationships, and employees. Inaddition, future acquisitions could place significant demand on administrative, operational, andfinancial resources.     Tight credit markets could impact our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms orincrease the cost of future financing. Although the recent credit market turmoil did not have asignificant adverse impact on our liquidity or borrowing costs, the availability of funds tightenedand credit spreads on corporate debt increased. Obtaining additional or replacement financing maybe more difficult and the cost of issuing new debt or replacing a credit facility would likely behigher than under our current facilities. Tight credit conditions could limit our ability tofinance acquisitions on terms acceptable to us.

Foreign operations contributed 15% of our sales in 2011. If we continue to growoutside the U.S., the risks associated with exposure to more volatile economic conditions,political instability, cultural and legal differences in conducting business, and currencyfluctuations will increase. In particular, our results are affected by fluctuations in currencyexchange rates for the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso.     Our business depends on our ability to retain and to attract qualified sales and customerservice personnel. There are significant costs associated with hiring and training sales andcustomer service professionals. We greatly benefit from having employees who are familiar with theproducts we sell and their applications, as well as with our customer and supplier relationships.We could be adversely affected by a shortage of available skilled workers or the loss of asignificant number of our sales or customer service professionals, including through retirement asthe workforce ages.     An interruption of operations at our headquarters or distribution centers could adverselyimpact our business. Our business depends on maintaining operations at our headquarters anddistribution centers. A serious, prolonged interruption due to power outage, telecommunicationsoutage, terrorist attack, earthquake, hurricane, fire, flood or other natural disaster, or otherinterruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.     We are subject to litigation risk due to the nature of our business, which may have a materialadverse effect on our business. From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legalproceedings that arise from business transactions. These may, for example, relate to productliability claims, commercial disputes, or employment matters. In addition, we could face13 claims over other matters, such as claims arising from our status as a government contractor or corporateor securities law matters. The defense and ultimate outcome of lawsuits or other legal proceedingsmay result in higher operating expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations.     In addition to the risks identified above, other risks to our future performance include, butare not limited to, the following:  changes in customer preferences for products and services of the nature, brands,quality, or cost sold by Applied;   changes in customer procurement policies and practices;   changes in the market prices for products and services relative to the costs ofproviding them;   changes in operating expenses;   organizational changes within the company;   adverse regulation and legislation, both enacted and under consideration, includingwith respect to health care and federal tax policy (e.g., affecting the use of the LIFOinventory accounting method and the taxation of foreign-sourced income);   the variability and timing of new business opportunities including acquisitions,alliances, customer relationships, and supplier authorizations;   the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions;   volatility of our stock price and the resulting impact on our consolidated financialstatements; and   changes in accounting policies and practices that could impact our financialreporting and increase compliance costs"

RISK FACTORS.     In addition to other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider thefollowing factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition, or results ofoperations. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Certain risksare identified in Managements Discussion and Analysis on pages 5  11 in Applieds 2010 annualreport to shareholders, and that information is incorporated here by reference. Additional risksnot currently known to us, risks that could apply broadly to issuers, or risks that we currentlydeem immaterial, may also impact our business and operations.     Our business depends heavily on the operating levels of our customers and the economic factorsthat affect them. Many of the primary markets for the products and services we sell are subject tocyclical fluctuations that affect demand for goods and materials that our customers produce.Consequently, demand for our products and services has been and will continue to be influenced bymost of the same economic factors that affect demand for and production of customers goods andmaterials.     When, as occurred in the recent economic downturn, customers or prospective customers reduceproduction levels because of lower demand or tight credit conditions, their need for our productsand services diminishes. Selling prices and terms of sale come under pressure, adversely affectingthe profitability and the durability of customer relationships. Credit losses increase too.Volatile economic and credit conditions also make it more difficult for distributors, as well ascustomers and suppliers, to forecast and plan future business activities.     In addition, our industry confronts the longer-term secular trend of manufacturing customersmoving production overseas to reduce costs. Our ability to continue to serve such10Table of Contentscustomers may beimpaired and the size of our overall market opportunity in North America could be adverselyaffected.     Consolidation occurring in our customers and suppliers industries could adversely affect ourbusiness and financial results. In recent years, we have witnessed increased consolidation amongour product suppliers and customers. As customer industries consolidate, a greater proportion ofour sales could be derived from higher volume contracts, which could adversely impact the amountand volatility of our earnings. Consolidation among customers can trigger changes in theirpurchasing strategies, potentially moving large blocks of business among competing industrialdistributors and contributing to volatility in our sales. In addition, consolidation increases therisk of larger customers seeking to purchase industrial products directly from manufacturers ratherthan through distributors. Similarly, continued consolidation among our suppliers could reduce ourability to negotiate favorable pricing and other commercial terms for our inventory purchases.     Loss of key supplier authorizations, lack of product availability, or changes in supplierdistribution programs could adversely affect our sales and earnings. Our business depends onmaintaining an immediately available supply of various products to meet customer demand. Many ofour relationships with key product suppliers are longstanding, but are terminable by either party.The loss of key supplier authorizations, or a substantial decrease in the availability of theirproducts, could put us at a competitive disadvantage and have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness. Supply interruptions could arise from raw materials shortages, inadequate manufacturingcapacity or utilization to meet demand, financial problems, labor disputes or weather conditionsaffecting suppliers production, transportation disruptions, or other reasons beyond our control.Furthermore, we cannot be certain that particular products will be available to us, or available inquantities sufficient to meet customer demand, especially if demand outpaces supply in an economicrecovery.     In addition, as a distributor, we face the risk of key product suppliers changing theirrelationships with distributors generally, or Applied in particular, in a manner that adverselyimpacts us. For example, key suppliers could change any of the following: the prices we must payfor their products relative to other distributors or relative to competing products; the geographicor product line breadth of distributor authorizations; supplier support programs; or productpurchase or stocking expectations.     An increase in competition could decrease sales or earnings. We operate in a highlycompetitive industry. Our competitors include local, regional, national, and multinationaldistributors of industrial machinery parts, equipment, and supplies. Competition is largelyfocused in the local service area and is generally based on product line breadth, productavailability, service capabilities, and price. Some existing competitors have, and potentialmarket entrants may have, greater financial or other resources than we do. If existing or futurecompetitors seek to gain or to retain market share by reducing prices, we may need to lowerour prices for products or services, thereby adversely affecting financial results.11Table of Contents     The purchasing incentives we earn from product suppliers can be impacted if we reduce ourpurchases in response to declining customer demand. Certain of our product suppliers havehistorically offered to their distributors, including us, incentives for purchasing their products.The programs often pay incentives to the distributor for attaining specific purchase volumesduring the program period. In some cases, in order to earn incentives, we must achieveyear-over-year growth in purchases with the supplier. When customer demand for our productsdeclines, we may be less willing to add inventory to take advantage of certain incentive programs,thereby potentially adversely impacting our profitability.     Volatility in product and energy costs can affect our profitability. In recent years, costincreases in commodity materials, such as steel and energy, led product manufacturers to increasethe prices of products we distribute. In addition, a portion of our own distribution costs iscomprised of fuel for our sales and delivery vehicles, freight, and utility expenses for ourfacilities.

Whencustomers or prospective customers reduce production levels in response to lower demand for theirproducts, they have less need for our products and services. Also, during periods of economicslowdown, our credit losses could increase. In addition,because some customers are moving operations overseas in order to reduce manufacturing costs,our ability to continue to serve those customers may be impaired and the size of our overall marketopportunity in North America may be diminished. 12Table of ContentsConsolidation occurring in our customers and suppliers industries could adversely affect ourbusiness and financial results. In recent years, we have witnessed increased consolidation amongour product suppliers and customers. As customer industries consolidate, a greater proportion ofour sales could be derived from larger, national contracts, which could adversely impact the amountand volatility of our earnings. In addition, consolidation increases the risk of larger customersseeking to purchase industrial products directly from manufacturers rather than throughdistributors. Similarly, continued consolidation among our suppliers could reduce our ability tonegotiate favorable pricing and other commercial terms for our inventory purchases.OTHER RISKSIn addition to the risks identified above, other risks we face include, but are not limitedto, the following:  changes in customer preferences for products and services of the nature, brands,quality, or cost sold by Applied;  changes in the market prices for products and services relative to the cost ofproviding them;  changes in customer procurement policies and practices;  changes in product manufacturer sales policies and practices;  changes in operating expenses;  the variability and timing of new business opportunities including acquisitions,alliances, customer relationships, and supplier authorizations;  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions;  our ability to access capital markets as needed;  volatility of our stock price and the resulting impact on our consolidated financialstatements;  changes in accounting policies and practices;  organizational changes within the company; and  adverse regulation and legislation"

RISK FACTORS.     In addition to other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider thefollowing factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition, or results ofoperations. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risksnot currently known to us, risks that could apply to any issuer, or risks that we currently deemimmaterial, may also impact our business and operations.RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS     Loss of key supplier authorizations, lack of product availability, or changes in supplierdistribution programs could adversely affect our sales and earnings. Our business depends onmaintaining an immediately available supply of various products sufficient to meet customer demand.Of our overall dollar volume of product purchases in fiscal 2007, almost half was purchased fromour top 10 suppliers. Many of our relationships with key product suppliers are longstanding, butare terminable by either party. The loss of key supplier authorizations, or a substantial decreasein the availability of their products, could have a material adverse effect on our business.Supply interruptions could arise from shortages of raw materials, labor disputes or weatherconditions affecting suppliers production, transportation disruptions, or other reasons beyond ourcontrol. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that particular products will be available to us, oravailable in quantities sufficient to meet customer demand. Limitations on our access to productscould put us at a competitive disadvantage.     In addition, as a distributor, we face the risk of key product suppliers changing theirrelationships with distributors generally, or Applied in particular, in a manner that adverselyimpacts us. For example, key suppliers could change any of the following: the prices we must payfor their products relative to other distributors or relative to competing products; the geographicor product line breadth of distributor authorizations; supplier support programs; or productpurchase or stocking expectations.     An increase in competition could decrease sales or earnings. We operate in a highlycompetitive industry. Our competitors include local, regional, national, and multinational10Table of Contentsdistributors of industrial machinery parts, equipment, and supplies. Competition is largelyfocused in the local service area and is generally based on product line breadth, productavailability, service capabilities, and price. Some existing competitors have, and new marketentrants may have, greater financial resources than we do. If existing or future competitors seekto gain or to retain market share by reducing prices, we may need to lower our prices for productsor services, thereby adversely affecting financial results.     Increases in product and energy costs could reduce our profitability. Recent price increasesin commodity materials, such as steel, have resulted in product manufacturers increasing the pricesof products we distribute. In addition, a portion of our distribution costs is comprised of fueland freight costs, which have increased significantly in recent years. Our ability to pass onincreases in our costs depends on market conditions. Raising our prices could result in decreasedsales volume, which could significantly reduce our profitability.     A disruption of our information systems could increase expenses, decrease sales, or otherwisereduce earnings. Our ability to transact business has become increasingly reliant on ourinformation systems. We depend on information systems to process customer orders, manage inventoryand accounts receivable collections, purchase products, ship products to customers on a timelybasis, maintain cost-effective operations, and provide superior service to customers. A serious,prolonged disruption of our information systems could materially impair fundamental businessprocesses.     Our business depends on our ability to retain and attract qualified sales and customer servicepersonnel. There are significant costs associated with hiring and training sales and customerservice professionals. We greatly benefit from having employees who are familiar with the productswe sell and their applications, as well as with our customer and supplier relationships. We couldbe adversely affected by a shortage of available skilled workers or the loss of a significantnumber of our sales or customer service professionals, including through retirement as theworkforce ages.     Future acquisitions are a key component of our anticipated growth. We may not be able toidentify or complete future acquisitions, integrate them effectively into our operations, orrealize their anticipated benefits. Many industries we serve are mature. As a result, our growthin recent years has resulted substantially from the acquisition of other businesses. While we wishto continue to acquire businesses, we may not be able to identify and negotiate suitableacquisitions, obtain financing for them on satisfactory terms, or otherwise complete acquisitions.In addition, existing or future competitors, including financial buyers, may increasingly seek tocompete with us for acquisitions, which could have the effect of increasing the price and reducingthe number of suitable opportunities.     We seek acquisition opportunities that complement and expand our operations. However,substantial costs, delays, or other difficulties related to integrating acquisitions into ouroperations could adversely affect our business or financial results. We could face significant11Table of Contentschallenges in consolidating functions and integrating procedures, information technology,personnel, and operations in a timely and efficient manner.     Further, even if we integrate successfully our operations with our acquisitions, we may not beable to realize the cost savings, sales increases, or other benefits that we anticipate from theseacquisitions, either as to amount or in the time frame we expect. Our ability to realizeanticipated benefits may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: our abilityto reduce duplicative expenses and inventory effectively, and to consolidate facilities; theincurrence of significant integration costs or charges in order to achieve those benefits; and ourability to retain key product supplier authorizations and customer relationships. In addition,future acquisitions could place significant demand on administrative, operational, and financialresources.     An interruption of operations at our headquarters or distribution centers could adverselyimpact our business. Our business depends on maintaining operations at our headquarters anddistribution centers. A serious, prolonged interruption due to power outage, telecommunicationsoutage, terrorist attack, earthquake, hurricane, fire, flood or other natural disaster, or otherinterruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.     Our growth outside the United States increases our exposure to global economic and politicalconditions. Our foreign operations contributed 11.7% of our sales in 2007. If we continue to growoutside the U.S., the risks associated with exposure to more volatile economic conditions,political instability, cultural and legal differences in conducting business, and currencyfluctuations will increase.     We are subject to litigation risk due to the nature of our business, which may have a materialadverse effect on our business. From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legalproceedings that arise from business transactions. These may, for example, relate to productliability claims, commercial disputes, or employment matters. In addition, we could face claimsover other matters, such as claims arising from our status as a government contractor or corporateor securities law matters. The defense and ultimate outcome of lawsuits or other legal proceedingsmay result in higher operating expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations.RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY     Our business depends heavily on the operating levels of our customers and the economic factorsthat affect them. Some of the primary markets for the products and services we sell are subject tocyclical fluctuations that affect demand for goods that our customers produce. Consequently, thedemand for our services and products has been and will continue to be influenced by most of thesame economic factors that affect the demand for and production of customers goods.

For example, keysuppliers could change the prices we must pay for their products relative toother distributors or relative to competing products, geographic or product linebreadth of distributor authorizations, purchase incentive programs, productpurchase or stocking expectations, or other aspects of our relationships.     AN INCREASE IN COMPETITION COULD DECREASE SALES OR EARNINGS. We operate ina highly competitive industry. We compete primarily with multinational,national, regional, and local distributors of industrial machinery parts,equipment, and supplies. Competition is largely focused in the local servicearea and is generally based on product line breadth, product availability,service capabilities, and price. Some existing competitors have, and new marketentrants may have, greater financial resources than we do. To the extentexisting or future competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducingprices, we may be required to lower our prices for products or services, therebyadversely affecting financial results.                                       10     INCREASES IN PRODUCT AND ENERGY COSTS COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY.Recent price increases in commodity materials, such as steel, have resulted inindustrial product manufacturers increasing the prices of products wedistribute.

Ourability to pass on increases in our costs depends on market conditions. Raisingour prices could result in decreased sales volume, which could significantlyreduce our profitability.     A DISRUPTION OF OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS COULD INCREASE EXPENSES, DECREASESALES, OR OTHERWISE REDUCE EARNINGS. Our ability to transact business has becomeincreasingly reliant on our information systems. We depend on informationsystems to process customer orders, manage inventory and accounts receivablecollections, purchase products, ship products to our customers on a timelybasis, maintain cost-effective operations, and provide superior service to ourcustomers. A serious, prolonged disruption of our information systems couldmaterially impair fundamental business processes.

We could beadversely affected by a shortage of available skilled workers or the loss of asignificant number of our sales or customer service professionals, includingthrough retirement as the workforce ages.     FUTURE ACQUISITIONS ARE A KEY COMPONENT OF OUR ANTICIPATED GROWTH. WE MAYNOT BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY OR COMPLETE FUTURE ACQUISITIONS, INTEGRATE THEMEFFECTIVELY INTO OUR OPERATIONS, OR REALIZE THEIR ANTICIPATED BENEFITS. Manyindustries we serve are mature. As a result, our growth in recent years hasresulted in substantial part from the acquisition of other businesses. While wewish to continue to acquire businesses, we may not be able to identify andnegotiate suitable acquisitions, obtain financing for them on satisfactoryterms, or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future. In addition, existingor future competitors, including financial buyers, may increasingly seek tocompete with us for acquisitions, which could have the effect of increasing theprice and reducing the number of suitable opportunities.     We seek acquisition opportunities that complement and expand ouroperations. However, substantial costs, delays, or other difficulties related tointegrating acquisitions into our operations could adversely affect our businessor financial results. We could face significant challenges in consolidatingfunctions and integrating procedures, information technology, personnel, andoperations in a timely and efficient manner.     Further, even if we integrate successfully our operations with ouracquisitions, we may not be able to realize the cost savings, sales increases,or other benefits that we anticipate from these acquisitions, either as toamount or in the time frame we expect. Our ability to realize anticipatedbenefits may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: ourability to reduce duplicative expenses and inventory effectively, and toconsolidate facilities; the                                       11incurrence of significant integration costs or charges in order to achieve thosebenefits; and our ability to retain key product supplier authorizations andcustomer relationships. In addition, future acquisitions could place significantdemand on administrative, operational, and financial resources.     AN INTERRUPTION OF OPERATIONS AT OUR HEADQUARTERS OR DISTRIBUTION CENTERSCOULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS. Our business is highly dependent onmaintaining operations at our headquarters and distribution centers. A serious,prolonged interruption of operations due to power outages, terrorist attack,earthquake, hurricane, fire, flood or other natural disaster, or otherinterruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and financialresults.     OUR GROWTH OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES INCREASES OUR EXPOSURE TO GLOBALECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS. Our foreign operations contributed 11.3% ofour sales in 2006. If we continue to grow outside the U.S., the risks associatedwith exposure to more volatile economic conditions, political instability,cultural and legal differences in conducting business, and currency fluctuationswill increase.     WE ARE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION RISK DUE TO THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS, WHICHMAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. From time to time, we areinvolved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings that arise from businesstransactions. These may, for example, relate to product liability claims,commercial disputes, or employment matters. In addition, we could face claimsover other matters, such as claims arising from our status as a governmentcontractor or corporate or securities law matters. The defense and ultimateoutcome of lawsuits or other legal proceedings may result in higher operatingexpenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition, or results of operations.RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY     OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS HEAVILY UPON THE OPERATING LEVELS OF OUR CUSTOMERS ANDTHE ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT AFFECT THEM. Some of the primary markets for theproducts and services we sell are subject to cyclical fluctuations that affectdemand for goods that our customers produce. Consequently, the demand for ourservices and products has been and will continue to be influenced by most of thesame economic factors that affect the demand for and production of customers'goods. When customers or prospective customers reduce their production levels inresponse to lower demand for their products, they have less need for ourproducts and services. Also during periods of economic slowdown, our creditlosses could increase. In addition, because some customers are moving portionsof operations overseas in order to reduce manufacturing costs, our ability tocontinue to serve those customers may be impaired and the size of our overallmarket opportunity in North America may be diminished.     THE CONSOLIDATION OCCURRING IN OUR CUSTOMERS' AND SUPPLIERS' INDUSTRIESCOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. In recent years, wehave witnessed increased consolidation among our product suppliers andcustomers. As customer industries consolidate, a greater proportion of our salescould be derived from larger, national contracts, which could                                       12adversely impact the amount and volatility of our earnings.
