Investors should carefully consider the risks set forth below and all other information contained in this report and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as market conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, wars or conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic or business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business and financial results.Business RisksRaw material and other cost inflation as well as product shortages could adversely affect our business and financial results.We manufacture certain parts and components of our products and therefore require raw materials from suppliers, which could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. Our prices and lead times for raw materials and other components necessary for production have fluctuated in the past year, including increased raw production costs, increased wage rates, and extended lead times. Significant increases could adversely affect our profit margins and results of operations. Changes in trade policies; shortages due to the residual effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, other pandemics, or any other reason; and the imposition of duties and tariffs and potential retaliatory countermeasures could adversely impact the price or availability of raw materials. In addition, labor shortages or an increase in the cost of labor could adversely affect our profit margins and results of operations. Due to competitive pressures or other factors, we may not be able to pass along increased raw material and component part costs to our customers in the form of price increases or our ability to do so could be delayed, which could adversely impact our business and financial results.The costs of certain raw materials, components, transportation and energy necessary for our operations and the production and distribution of our products have increased significantly. While we have implemented certain cost containment measures and selective price increases, as well as taken other actions to offset these inflationary pressures in our supply chain, we may not be able to offset all of the increases in our operational costs, which could adversely impact our business and financial results.Demand for our products may be adversely affected by numerous factors, some of which we cannot predict or control. This could adversely affect our business and financial results.Numerous factors may affect the demand for our products, including:•Deterioration of economic conditions in major markets served•Residual economic and operational impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, or the impact of other pandemics•Economic and operational impact of the war between Russia and Ukraine or other wars•Consolidation in the marketplace allowing competitors to be more efficient and more price competitive•Competitors entering the marketplace•Decreasing product life cycles•Changes in customer preferences•Ability to achieve strong operational performance, including the manufacture and sale of high-quality products and the ability to meet customer delivery expectationsIf any of these factors occur, the demand for our products could suffer, and this could adversely impact our business and financial results.8Table of ContentsFailure to compete effectively or to successfully execute our strategy may have a negative impact on our business and financial results.We actively compete with companies that produce and market the same or similar products, and in some instances, with companies that sell different products that are designed for the same target markets. Competition may force us to reduce prices or incur additional costs to remain competitive in an environment in which business models, including the development and use of artificial intelligence technologies, are changing rapidly. We compete on the basis of several factors, including customer support, product innovation, product offering, product quality, price, expertise, digital capabilities, production capabilities, and for multinational customers, our global footprint. Present or future competitors may develop and introduce new and enhanced products, offer products based on alternative technologies and processes, accept lower profit, have greater financial, technical or other resources, or have lower production costs or other pricing advantages. Any of these could put us at a disadvantage by threatening our share of sales or reducing our profit margins, which could adversely impact our business and financial results.Additionally, throughout our global business, distributors and customers may not accept our price increases or may seek lower cost sourcing opportunities, which could result in a loss of business that may adversely impact our business and financial results.Our strategy is to expand into higher-growth adjacent product categories and markets with technologically advanced new products, as well as to grow our sales generated through the digital channel. While traditional direct marketing channels such as catalogs are an important means of advertising and selling our products, an increasing number of customers are purchasing products on the internet. Our strategy to increase sales through the digital channel is an investment in our internet sales capabilities. There is a risk that we may not continue to successfully implement this strategy, or if successfully implemented, we may not realize its expected benefits due to increased competition and pricing pressure brought about by the internet. Our failure to successfully implement our strategy could adversely impact our business and financial results.Failure to develop or acquire technologically advanced products that meet customer demands, including price expectations, could adversely impact our business and financial results.We develop technologically advanced new products to promote our organic growth and profitability. Technology is changing rapidly and our competitors are innovating quickly. If we do not keep pace with developing technologically advanced products, we risk product commoditization, deterioration of the value of our brand, and reduced ability to effectively compete. We must continue to develop innovative products, as well as acquire and retain the necessary intellectual property rights in these products. If we fail to innovate, or we launch products with quality problems, or if customers do not accept our products, then our business and financial results could be adversely affected.The failure to properly identify, integrate and grow acquired companies, and to manage contingent liabilities from divested businesses could adversely affect our business and financial results.Our historical growth has included acquisitions and our future growth strategy includes acquisitions. We completed the acquisitions of Code, Magicard and Nordic ID in fiscal 2021 for a total purchase price of $244.0 million. Acquisitions place significant demands on management, operational, and financial resources. Recent and future acquisitions will require integration of operations, sales and marketing, information technology, finance, and administrative operations, which could decrease the time available to focus on our other growth strategies. We cannot assure that we will be able to successfully integrate acquisitions, that these acquisitions will operate profitably, or that we will be able to achieve the desired sales growth or operational success. Our sales, results of operations, cash flow, and liquidity could be adversely affected if we do not successfully integrate acquired businesses, including realizing synergies, or if our other businesses suffer due to the increased focus on the acquired businesses.We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that we determine do not align with our strategic plan, or that are not achieving the desired return on investment. Divestitures pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business. When we decide to sell a business or specific assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms or within our anticipated timeframe, and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell a business, the sale is typically subject to pre-closing conditions which may not be satisfied. In addition, the impact of the divestiture on our revenue and net income may be larger than projected, which could distract management, and disputes may arise with buyers. We have retained responsibility for and have agreed to indemnify buyers against certain contingent liabilities related to several businesses that we have sold. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse impact on our financial results, but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue.9Table of ContentsThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our operations and business.The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the global economy and adversely impacted our businesses, including demand for our products across multiple end-markets as well as our supply chain and operations. Any future resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic, or other health epidemics, may have an impact on our business, operations and financial results depending on factors that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of any health epidemic, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, the extent to which vaccines or other medical treatments are developed and made available to and accepted by the public, and the impact of these and other factors on our stakeholders.Global Operating RisksOur failure or the failure of third-party service providers to protect our sites, networks and systems against security breaches, to protect our confidential information, or to facilitate our digital strategy, could adversely affect our business and financial results. Our business systems collect, transmit and store data about our customers, vendors and others, including credit card information and personally identifiable information. We also employ third-party service providers that store, process and transmit proprietary, personal and confidential information on our behalf. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties in an effort to securely transmit confidential and sensitive information, including credit card numbers. Our security measures, and those of our third-party service providers, may not detect or prevent all attempts to hack our systems, denial-of-service attacks, viruses, malicious software, break-ins, phishing attacks, social engineering, security breaches or other similar disruptions that may jeopardize the security of information stored in or transmitted by our sites, networks and systems or that we or our third-party service providers otherwise maintain. We engage third-party service providers to assist with certain of our website and digital platform upgrades, which may result in a decline in sales when initially deployed, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.We and our service providers may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent all types of attacks, and techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or to sabotage systems change frequently and may not be known until launched against us or our third-party service providers. In addition, security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships. Although we maintain privacy, data breach and network security liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate or will cover liabilities actually incurred, or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Any compromise or breach of our security measures, or those of our third-party service providers, could adversely impact our ability to conduct business, violate applicable privacy, data security and other laws, and cause significant legal and financial exposure, adverse publicity, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.We depend on key employees and the loss of these individuals could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.Our financial results could be adversely affected by increased competition for employees, difficulty in recruiting employees, higher employee turnover or increased compensation and benefit costs. Our employees are important to our success and we are dependent on our ability to retain the services of our employees in key roles. We have built our business on a set of core values, and we attempt to hire and retain employees who are committed to these values and our culture of providing exceptional service to our customers. In order to compete and to continue to grow, we must attract, retain and motivate our employees. We need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical and industry experience to operate our business successfully. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals, or if our costs to do so increase significantly, or if internal realignment of responsibilities are not executed properly, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.We are a global company headquartered in the United States. We are subject to extensive regulations by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and self-regulatory entities at various levels of the governing bodies. Failure to comply with laws and regulations could adversely affect our business and financial results.Approximately 50% of our sales are derived outside of the United States. Our operations are subject to the risks of doing business domestically and globally, including the following:•Delays or disruptions in product deliveries and payments in connection with international manufacturing and sales.•Regulations resulting from political and economic instability and disruptions.•Imposition of new or changes in existing duties, tariffs and trade agreements, which could have a direct or indirect impact on our ability to manufacture products, on our customers' demand for our products, or on our suppliers' ability to deliver raw materials.10Table of Contents•Import, export and economic sanction laws.•Current and changing governmental policies, regulatory, and business environments.•Disadvantages from competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.•Local labor regulations.•Regulations relating to climate change, air emissions, wastewater discharges, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes.•Regulations relating to product content, health, safety and the protection of the environment.•Imposition of trade or travel restrictions as a result of any continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, or as a result of other pandemics or global health crises.•Specific country regulations where our products are manufactured or sold.•Regulations relating to compliance with data protection and privacy laws throughout our global business.•Laws and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government, including audit requirements of government contracts related to procurement integrity, export control, employment practices, and the accuracy of records and recording of costs.Further, these laws and regulations are constantly evolving and it is difficult to accurately predict the effect they may have upon our business and financial results.We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims rules, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. Any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and related lawsuits by shareholders and others, damage our reputation, and adversely impact our business and financial results.We are subject to litigation that could adversely impact our business, financial results, and reputation.We are a party to litigation that arises in the normal course of our business operations, including product liability and recall (strict liability and negligence) claims, patent and trademark matters, contract disputes and environmental, employment and other litigation matters. We face an inherent risk that our competitors will allege that aspects of our products infringe their intellectual property or that our intellectual property is invalid, such that we could be prevented from manufacturing and selling our products or prevented from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products. We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other damage. To date, we have not incurred material costs related to these types of claims. However, while we currently maintain insurance coverage for certain types of claims that we believe is adequate, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms or that this insurance will provide sufficient coverage against potential liabilities that may arise. Any claims brought against us, with or without merit, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and reputation as a result of potential adverse outcomes. The expenses associated with defending such claims and the diversion of our management’s resources and time may have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.Global climate change and related emphasis on ESG matters by various stakeholders could negatively affect our businessIncreased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more regional and/or federal requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas emissions.  There continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty.  Further, our customers and the markets we serve may impose emissions or other environmental standards through regulation, market-based emissions policies or consumer preference that we may not be able to timely meet due to the required level of capital investment or technological advancement. Additionally, the enhanced stakeholder focus on ESG issues relating to our business requires the continuous monitoring of various and evolving standards and the associated reporting requirements.  A failure to adequately meet stakeholder expectations may result in the loss of business, diluted market valuation, an inability to attract customers or an inability to attract and retain top talent.11Table of ContentsFinancial and Security Ownership RisksThe global nature of our business exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations that could adversely affect our business and financial results.Approximately 50% of our sales are derived outside the United States. Sales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S. dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, and may adversely affect our financial results. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in currencies other than U.S. dollars into other countries. Decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials, products, and services purchased overseas. Our sales and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, and further strengthening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects, which occurred during fiscal years 2020 and 2022. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries may invoice customers in a currency other than its functional currency or may be invoiced by suppliers in a currency other than its functional currency, which could result in unfavorable translation effects on our business and financial results.Failure to execute our strategies could result in impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, which may negatively impact income and profitability. We have goodwill of $592.6 million and other intangible assets of $62.1 million as of July 31, 2023, which represents 47.1% of our total assets, and we have recognized impairment charges in the past. We evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present, based upon the fair value of each respective asset. The valuations prepared for the required impairment test include management's estimates of sales, profitability, cash flow generation, capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditures, and other assumptions. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to achieve sales projections or cost savings, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected changes in the use of the assets, and divestitures may adversely impact the assumptions used in the valuations. If the estimated fair value of our goodwill or other intangible assets change in future periods, we may be required to record an impairment charge, which would reduce net income in such period. Indicators of other-than-temporary impairment were present in our equity investment in React Mobile, Inc., an employee safety software and hardware company, and we recognized an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $5.0 million in fiscal 2021. Changes in tax legislation or tax rates could adversely affect results of operations and financial statements. Additionally, audits by taxing authorities could result in tax payments for prior periods.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many non-U.S. jurisdictions. As such, our income is subject to risk due to changing tax laws and tax rates around the world. Our tax filings are subject to audit by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. If these audits result in payments or assessments that differ from our reserves, our future net income may be adversely impacted.We review the probability of the realization of our deferred tax assets quarterly based on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. As part of this review, we utilize historical results, projected future operating results, eligible carry-forward periods, tax planning opportunities, and other relevant considerations. Changes in profitability and financial outlook in both the U.S. and/or foreign jurisdictions, or changes in our geographic footprint may require modifications in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. At any point in time, there are a number of tax proposals at various stages of legislation throughout the globe. While it is impossible for us to predict whether some or all of these proposals will be enacted, many will likely have an impact on our business and financial results.Substantially all of our voting stock is controlled by two shareholders, while our public investors hold non-voting stock. The interests of the voting and non-voting shareholders could differ, potentially resulting in decisions that affect the value of the non-voting shares.Substantially all of our voting stock is controlled by Elizabeth P. Bruno, one of our directors, and William H. Brady III, both of whom are descendants of the Company's founder. All of our publicly traded shares are non-voting. Therefore, the voting shareholders have control in most matters requiring approval or acquiescence by shareholders, including the composition of our Board of Directors and many corporate actions, and their interests may not align with those of the non-voting shareholders. Such concentration of ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a purchase offer that our public shareholders may find favorable and it may adversely affect the trading price for our non-voting common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies whose voting stock is controlled by a limited number of shareholders. Additionally, certain private investors, mutual funds and index sponsors have implemented rules restricting ownership, or excluding from indices, companies with non-voting publicly traded shares. For example, the Company was removed from the Russell 2000 Index in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 for not meeting the minimum voting rights hurdle.12Table of Contents"

Investors should carefully consider the risks set forth below and all other information contained in this report and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as market conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, wars or conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic or business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business and financial results.Business RisksRaw material and other cost inflation as well as product shortages could adversely affect our business and financial results.We manufacture certain parts and components of our products and therefore require raw materials from suppliers, which could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. Prices and lead times for raw materials and other components necessary for production have fluctuated in the past, including increased raw production costs, increased wage rates, and extended lead times. Significant increases could adversely affect our profit margins and results of operations. Changes in trade policies; shortages due to the COVID-19 pandemic, other pandemics, or any other reason; the imposition of duties and tariffs and potential retaliatory countermeasures could adversely impact the price or availability of raw materials. In addition, labor shortages or an increase in the cost of labor could adversely affect our profit margins and results of operations. Due to competitive pressures or other factors, the Company may not be able to pass along increased raw material and component part costs to its customers in the form of price increases or our ability to do so could be delayed, which could adversely impact our business and financial results.The costs of certain raw materials, components, transportation and energy necessary for our operations and the production and distribution of our products have increased significantly. While we have implemented certain cost containment measures and selective price increases, as well as taken other actions to offset these inflationary pressures in our supply chain, we may not be able to offset all of the increases in our operational costs, which could adversely impact our business and financial results.The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and continues to pose risks to our operations and business.The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the global economy and adversely impacted our businesses, including demand for our products across multiple end-markets as well as our supply chain and operations. While we have experienced sequentially improving activity in most markets and geographies, the public health situation, global response measures and corresponding impacts on various markets remain fluid and uncertain and may lead to sudden changes in trajectory and outlook. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our business most recently related to supply chain disruptions, labor constraints, inflation, and government-mandated lockdowns. The duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial results depends on factors that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of COVID-19, the emergence of new variants of the virus, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, the extent to which vaccines or other medical treatments are developed and made available to and accepted by the public, and the impact of these and other factors on our stakeholders.Some actions that we have taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic include enabling remote working arrangements, which may create increased vulnerability to cybersecurity incidents, including breaches of information systems security, which could damage our reputation and commercial relationships, disrupt operations, increase costs or decrease revenues, and expose us to claims from customers, suppliers, financial institutions, regulators, payment card associations, employees and others. While we attempt to maintain sufficient inventory levels in order to meet rapidly shifting customer demand patterns and supplier lead time requirements, we cannot be certain we will be able to accurately predict demand or lead times, which may cause us to be unable to service customer demand or expose us to risks of product shortages, or result in excess inventory, which could lead to additional inventory carrying costs and inventory obsolescence.The conditions caused by COVID-19 have affected, and may continue to affect, the overall demand environment for our products. The level of demand for certain product components has resulted in, and may continue to result in, lengthened lead times and higher input costs, including freight. Additionally, our financial results may be adversely impacted by challenges in the macroeconomic environment, including rapid cost inflation.Although our current accounting estimates contemplate current and expected future conditions, as applicable, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could differ from our expectations, which could materially affect our results of 8Table of Contentsoperations and financial position. In particular, a number of estimates have been and will continue to be affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The severity, magnitude and duration, as well as the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, are uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict. As a result, our accounting estimates and assumptions may change over time in response to COVID-19. Such changes could result in future impairments of goodwill, intangible assets, long-lived assets, incremental credit losses on accounts receivable, excess and obsolete inventories, or a decrease in the carrying amount of our deferred tax assets. Any of these events could amplify the other risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2022 and could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.Demand for our products may be adversely affected by numerous factors, some of which we cannot predict or control. This could adversely affect our business and financial results.Numerous factors may affect the demand for our products, including:•Deterioration of economic conditions in major markets served.•Ongoing economic and operational impact of the COVID-19 or other pandemics.•Economic and operational impact of the war between Russia and Ukraine or other wars.•Consolidation in the marketplace allowing competitors to be more efficient and more price competitive.•Competitors entering the marketplace.•Decreasing product life cycles.•Changes in customer preferences.•Ability to achieve strong operational performance, including the manufacture and sale of high-quality products and the ability to meet customer delivery expectations.If any of these factors occur, the demand for our products could suffer, and this could adversely impact our business and financial results.Failure to compete effectively or to successfully execute our strategy may have a negative impact on our business and financial results.We actively compete with companies that produce and market the same or similar products, and in some instances, with companies that sell different products that are designed for the same end user. Competition may force us to reduce prices or incur additional costs to remain competitive in an environment in which business models are changing rapidly.

Any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and related lawsuits by shareholders and others, damage our reputation, and adversely impact our business and financial results.We are subject to litigation that could adversely impact our business, financial results, and reputation.We are a party to litigation that arises in the normal course of our business operations, including product liability and recall (strict liability and negligence) claims, patent and trademark matters, contract disputes and environmental, employment and other litigation matters. We face an inherent risk that our competitors will allege that aspects of our products infringe their intellectual property or that our intellectual property is invalid, such that we could be prevented from manufacturing and selling our products or prevented from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products. We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other damage. To date, we have not incurred material costs related to these types of claims. However, while we currently maintain insurance coverage for certain types of claims that we believe is adequate, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms or that this insurance will provide sufficient coverage against potential liabilities that may arise. Any claims brought against us, with or without merit, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and reputation as a result of potential adverse outcomes. The expenses associated with defending such claims and the diversion of our management’s resources and time may have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.11Table of ContentsFinancial and Security Ownership RisksThe global nature of our business exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations that could adversely affect our business and financial results.Approximately 50% of our sales are derived outside the United States. Sales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S. dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, and may adversely affect our financial results. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in currencies other than U.S. dollars into other countries. Decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials, products, and services purchased overseas. Our sales and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, and further strengthening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects, which occurred during fiscal years 2020 and 2022. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries may invoice customers in a currency other than its functional currency or may be invoiced by suppliers in a currency other than its functional currency, which could result in unfavorable translation effects on our business and financial results.Failure to execute our strategies could result in impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, which may negatively impact income and profitability. We have goodwill of $586.8 million and other intangible assets of $74.0 million as of July 31, 2022, which represents 48.3% of our total assets, and we have recognized impairment charges in the past. We evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present, based upon the fair value of each respective asset. The valuations prepared for the required impairment test include management's estimates of sales, profitability, cash flow generation, capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditures, and other assumptions. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to achieve sales projections or cost savings, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected changes in the use of the assets, and divestitures may adversely impact the assumptions used in the valuations. If the estimated fair value of our goodwill or other intangible assets change in future periods, we may be required to record an impairment charge, which would reduce net income in such period. Indicators of other-than-temporary impairment were present in our equity investment in React Mobile, Inc., an employee safety software and hardware company, and we recognized an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $5.0 million in fiscal 2021. Changes in tax legislation or tax rates could adversely affect results of operations and financial statements. Additionally, audits by taxing authorities could result in tax payments for prior periods.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many non-U.S. jurisdictions. As such, our income is subject to risk due to changing tax laws and tax rates around the world. Our tax filings are subject to audit by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. If these audits result in payments or assessments that differ from our reserves, our future net income may be adversely impacted.We review the probability of the realization of our deferred tax assets quarterly based on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. As part of this review, we utilize historical results, projected future operating results, eligible carry-forward periods, tax planning opportunities, and other relevant considerations. Changes in profitability and financial outlook in both the U.S. and/or foreign jurisdictions, or changes in our geographic footprint may require modifications in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. At any point in time, there are a number of tax proposals at various stages of legislation throughout the globe. While it is impossible for us to predict whether some or all of these proposals will be enacted, many will likely have an impact on our business and financial results.Substantially all of our voting stock is controlled by two shareholders, while our public investors hold non-voting stock. The interests of the voting and non-voting shareholders could differ, potentially resulting in decisions that affect the value of the non-voting shares.Substantially all of our voting stock is controlled by Elizabeth P. Bruno, one of our directors, and William H. Brady III, both of whom are descendants of the Company's founder. All of our publicly traded shares are non-voting. Therefore, the voting shareholders have control in most matters requiring approval or acquiescence by shareholders, including the composition of our Board of Directors and many corporate actions, and their interests may not align with those of the non-voting shareholders. Such concentration of ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a purchase offer that our public shareholders may find favorable and it may adversely affect the trading price for our non-voting common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies whose voting stock is controlled by a limited number of shareholders. Additionally, certain private investors, mutual funds and index sponsors have implemented rules restricting ownership, or excluding from indices, companies with non-voting publicly traded shares.12Table of Contents"
8,BRC,BRADY CORP,2021-09-02,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
Investors should carefully consider the risks set forth below and all other information contained in this report and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as market conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, wars or conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic or business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business and financial results.COVID-19 RisksThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted worldwide economic conditions and could have a material adverse effect on our operations and business.The COVID-19 pandemic initially impacted our operations in the third quarter of the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020 and may continue to affect our business, particularly should government authorities impose mandatory closures, work-from-home orders or social distancing protocols, seek voluntary facility closures or impose other restrictions. Should such actions be taken, it could materially adversely affect our ability to adequately staff and maintain our operations and impact our financial results. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic also include restrictions on our employees’ ability to visit customers as well as disruptions or temporary closures of our facilities. Some actions that we have taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic include enabling remote working arrangements, which may create increased vulnerability to cybersecurity incidents, including breaches of information systems security, which could damage our reputation and commercial relationships, disrupt operations, increase costs or decrease revenues, and expose us to claims from customers, suppliers, financial institutions, regulators, payment card associations, employees and others. While we attempt to maintain sufficient inventory levels in order to meet rapidly shifting customer demand patterns and supplier lead time requirements, we cannot be certain we will be able to accurately predict demand or lead times, which may cause us to be unable to service customer demand or expose us to risks of product shortages, or result in excess inventory, which could lead to additional inventory carrying costs and inventory obsolescence.The duration and ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations and financial condition, including liquidity, capital and financing resources, will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments. Such factors and developments may include the geographic spread, severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including whether there are periods of increased COVID-19 cases, disruption to our operations resulting from employee illnesses, the development, availability and administration of effective treatment or vaccines, the extent and duration of the impact on the U.S. and global economy, including the pace and extent of recovery when the pandemic subsides, and the actions that have been or may be taken by various governmental authorities in response to the outbreak, including current and future health and safety measures, such as mandatory facility closures of non-essential businesses, stay-at-home orders or similar restrictions, social distancing mandates and travel bans, and import and export restrictions, which could disrupt our relationship with customers. If we are unable to respond to and manage the impact of these events, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.Although our current accounting estimates contemplate current and expected future conditions, as applicable, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could differ from our expectations, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial position. In particular, a number of estimates have been and will continue to be affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The severity, magnitude and duration, as well as the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, are uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict. As a result, our accounting estimates and assumptions may change over time in response to COVID-19. Such changes could result in future impairments of goodwill, intangible assets, long-lived assets, incremental credit losses on accounts receivable, excess and obsolete inventories, or a decrease in the carrying amount of our deferred tax assets. Any of these events could amplify the other risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021 and could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.Demand for our products may be adversely affected by numerous factors, some of which we cannot predict or control. This could adversely affect our business and financial results.Numerous factors may affect the demand for our products, including:•Deterioration of economic conditions in major markets served.•Ongoing economic and operational impact of the COVID-19 or other pandemics.8Table of Contents•Consolidation in the marketplace allowing competitors to be more efficient and more price competitive.•Competitors entering the marketplace.•Decreasing product life cycles.•Changes in customer preferences.•Ability to achieve strong operational performance, including the manufacture and sale of high-quality products and the ability to meet customer delivery expectations.If any of these factors occur, the demand for our products could suffer, and this could adversely impact our business and financial results.Business RisksFailure to compete effectively or to successfully execute our strategy may have a negative impact on our business and financial results.We actively compete with companies that produce and market the same or similar products, and in some instances, with companies that sell different products that are designed for the same end user. Competition may force us to reduce prices or incur additional costs to remain competitive in an environment in which business models are changing rapidly. We compete on the basis of several factors, including customer support, product innovation, product offering, product quality, price, expertise, digital capabilities, production capabilities, and for multinational customers, our global footprint. Present or future competitors may develop and introduce new and enhanced products, offer products based on alternative technologies and processes, accept lower profit, have greater financial, technical or other resources, or have lower production costs or other pricing advantages. Any of these could put us at a disadvantage by threatening our share of sales or reducing our profit margins, which could adversely impact our business and financial results.Additionally, throughout our global business, distributors and customers may seek lower cost sourcing opportunities, which could result in a loss of business that may adversely impact our business and financial results.Our strategy is to expand into higher-growth adjacent product categories and markets with technologically advanced new products, as well as to grow our sales generated through the digital channel. While traditional direct marketing channels such as catalogs are an important means of selling our products, an increasing number of customers are purchasing products on the internet. Our strategy to increase sales through the digital channel is an investment in our internet sales capabilities. There is a risk that we may not continue to successfully implement this strategy, or if successfully implemented, we may not realize its expected benefits due to the continued levels of increased competition and pricing pressure brought about by the internet. Our failure to successfully implement our strategy could adversely impact our business and financial results.Failure to develop or acquire technologically advanced products that meet customer demands, including price expectations, could adversely impact our business and financial results.Development of technologically advanced new products is targeted as a driver of our organic growth and profitability. Technology is changing rapidly and our competitors are innovating quickly. If we do not keep pace with developing technologically advanced products, we risk product commoditization, deterioration of the value of our brand, and reduced ability to effectively compete. We must continue to develop innovative products, as well as acquire and retain the necessary intellectual property rights in these products. If we fail to innovate, or we launch products with quality problems, or if customers do not accept our products, then our business and financial results could be adversely affected.The failure to properly identify, integrate and grow acquired companies, and to manage contingent liabilities from divested businesses could adversely affect our business and financial results.Our historical growth has included acquisitions and our future growth strategy includes acquisitions. We completed the acquisitions of Code, Magicard and Nordic ID in fiscal 2021 for a total purchase price of $244.0 million. Acquisitions place significant demands on management, operational, and financial resources. Recent and future acquisitions will require integration of operations, sales and marketing, information technology, finance, and administrative operations, which could decrease the time available to focus on our other growth strategies. We cannot assure that we will be able to successfully integrate acquisitions, that these acquisitions will operate profitably, or that we will be able to achieve the desired sales growth or operational success. Our sales, results of operations, cash flow, and liquidity could be adversely affected if we do not successfully integrate the newly acquired businesses, including realizing synergies, or if our other businesses suffer due to the increased focus on the acquired businesses.We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that we determine do not align with our strategic plan, or that are not achieving the desired return on investment. Divestitures pose risks and challenges that 9Table of Contentscould negatively impact our business. When we decide to sell a business or specific assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms or within our anticipated timeframe, and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell a business, the sale is typically subject to pre-closing conditions which may not be satisfied. In addition, the impact of the divestiture on our revenue and net income may be larger than projected, which could distract management, and disputes may arise with buyers. We have retained responsibility for and have agreed to indemnify buyers against certain contingent liabilities related to several businesses that we have sold. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse impact on our financial results, but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue.Raw material and other cost increases and product shortages could adversely affect our business and financial results.We manufacture certain parts and components of our products and therefore require raw materials from suppliers, which could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. Prices and lead times for raw materials and other components necessary for production have fluctuated in the past, including increased raw production costs, increased wage rates, and extended lead times during the year ended July 31, 2021. Significant increases could adversely affect our profit margins and results of operations. Changes in trade policies; shortages due to the COVID-19, other pandemics, or any other reason; the imposition of duties and tariffs and potential retaliatory countermeasures could adversely impact the price or availability of raw materials. In addition, labor shortages or an increase in the cost of labor could adversely affect our profit margins and results of operations. Due to competitive pressures or other factors, the Company may not be able to pass along increased raw material and component part costs to its customers in the form of price increases or its ability to do so could be delayed, which could adversely impact our business and financial results.Global Operating RisksOur failure or the failure of third-party service providers to protect our sites, networks and systems against security breaches, to protect our confidential information, or to facilitate our digital strategy, could adversely affect our business and financial results. Our business systems collect, transmit and store data about our customers, vendors and others, including credit card information and personally identifiable information. We also employ third-party service providers that store, process and transmit proprietary, personal and confidential information on our behalf. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties in an effort to securely transmit confidential and sensitive information, including credit card numbers. Our security measures, and those of our third-party service providers, may not detect or prevent all attempts to hack our systems, denial-of-service attacks, viruses, malicious software, break-ins, phishing attacks, social engineering, security breaches or other similar disruptions that may jeopardize the security of information stored in or transmitted by our sites, networks and systems or that we or our third-party service providers otherwise maintain. We engage third-party service providers to assist with certain of our website and digital platform upgrades, which may result in a decline in sales when initially deployed, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.We and our service providers may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent all types of attacks, and techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or to sabotage systems change frequently and may not be known until launched against us or our third-party service providers. In addition, security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships. Although we maintain privacy, data breach and network security liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate or will cover liabilities actually incurred, or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Any compromise or breach of our security measures, or those of our third-party service providers, could adversely impact our ability to conduct business, violate applicable privacy, data security and other laws, and cause significant legal and financial exposure, adverse publicity, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.We depend on key employees and the loss of these individuals could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.Our financial results could be adversely affected by increased competition for employees, difficulty in recruiting employees, higher employee turnover or increased compensation and benefit costs. Our employees are important to our success and we are dependent on our ability to retain the services of our employees in key roles. We have built our business on a set of core values, and we attempt to hire and retain employees who are committed to these values and our culture of providing exceptional service to our customers. In order to compete and to continue to grow, we must attract, retain and motivate our employees. We need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical and industry experience to operate our business successfully. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our costs to do so increase significantly, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.10Table of ContentsWe are a global company headquartered in the United States. We are subject to extensive regulations by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and self-regulatory entities at various levels of the governing bodies. Failure to comply with laws and regulations could adversely affect our business and financial results.Nearly 50% of our sales are derived outside of the United States. Our operations are subject to the risks of doing business domestically and globally, including the following:•Delays or disruptions in product deliveries and payments in connection with international manufacturing and sales.•Regulations resulting from political and economic instability and disruptions.•Imposition of new or changes in existing duties, tariffs and trade agreements, which could have a direct or indirect impact on our ability to manufacture products, on our customers' demand for our products, or on our suppliers' ability to deliver raw materials.•Import, export and economic sanction laws.•Current and changing governmental policies, regulatory, and business environments.•Disadvantages from competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.•Local labor regulations.•Regulations relating to climate change, air emissions, wastewater discharges, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes.•Regulations relating to product content, health, safety and the protection of the environment.•Imposition of trade or travel restrictions as a result of the COVID-19 or other pandemics.•Specific country regulations where our products are manufactured or sold.•Regulations relating to compliance with data protection and privacy laws throughout our global business.•Laws and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government, including audit requirements of government contracts related to procurement integrity, export control, employment practices, and the accuracy of records and recording of costs.Further, these laws and regulations are constantly evolving and it is difficult to accurately predict the effect they may have upon our business and financial results.We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims rules, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. Any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and related lawsuits by shareholders and others, damage our reputation, and adversely impact our business and financial results.We are subject to litigation, including product liability claims that could adversely impact our business, financial results, and reputation.We are a party to litigation that arises in the normal course of our business operations, including product liability and recall (strict liability and negligence) claims, patent and trademark matters, contract disputes and environmental, employment and other litigation matters. We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other damage. In addition, we face an inherent risk that our competitors will allege that aspects of our products infringe their intellectual property or that our intellectual property is invalid, such that we could be prevented from manufacturing and selling our products or prevented from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products. To date, we have not incurred material costs related to these types of claims. However, while we currently maintain insurance coverage for certain types of claims that we believe is adequate, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms or that this insurance will provide sufficient coverage against potential liabilities that may arise. Any claims brought against us, with or without merit, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and reputation as a result of potential adverse outcomes. The expenses associated with defending such claims and the diversion of our management’s resources and time may have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.11Table of ContentsFinancial and Security Ownership RisksThe global nature of our business exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations that could adversely affect our business and financial results.Nearly 50% of our sales are derived outside the United States. Sales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S. dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, and may adversely affect our financial results. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in currencies other than U.S. dollars into other countries. Decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials, products, and services purchased overseas. Our sales and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects, which occurred during fiscal years 2019 and 2020. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries may invoice customers in a currency other than its functional currency or may be invoiced by suppliers in a currency other than its functional currency, which could result in unfavorable translation effects on our business and financial results.Failure to execute our strategies could result in impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, which may negatively impact income and profitability. We have goodwill of $614.1 million and other intangible assets of $92.3 million as of July 31, 2021, which represents 51.3% of our total assets, and we have recognized impairment charges in the past. We evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present, based upon the fair value of each respective asset. The valuations prepared for the required impairment test include management's estimates of sales, profitability, cash flow generation, capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditures, and other assumptions. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to achieve sales projections or cost savings, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected changes in the use of the assets, and divestitures may adversely impact the assumptions used in the valuations. If the estimated fair value of our goodwill or other intangible assets change in future periods, we may be required to record an impairment charge, which would reduce net income in such period. Indicators of other-than-temporary impairment were present in our equity investment in React Mobile, Inc., an employee safety software and hardware company, and we recognized an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $5.0 million in fiscal 2021. Changes in tax legislation or tax rates could adversely affect results of operations and financial statements. Additionally, audits by taxing authorities could result in tax payments for prior periods.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many non-U.S. jurisdictions. As such, our income is subject to risk due to changing tax laws and tax rates around the world. Our tax filings are subject to audit by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. If these audits result in payments or assessments that differ from our reserves, our future net income may be adversely impacted.We review the probability of the realization of our deferred tax assets quarterly based on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. As part of this review, we utilize historical results, projected future operating results, eligible carry-forward periods, tax planning opportunities, and other relevant considerations. Changes in profitability and financial outlook in both the U.S. and/or foreign jurisdictions, or changes in our geographic footprint may require modifications in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. At any point in time, there are a number of tax proposals at various stages of legislation throughout the globe. While it is impossible for us to predict whether some or all of these proposals will be enacted, many will likely have an impact on our business and financial results.Substantially all of our voting stock is controlled by two shareholders, while our public investors hold non-voting stock. The interests of the voting and non-voting shareholders could differ, potentially resulting in decisions that affect the value of the non-voting shares.Substantially all of our voting stock is controlled by Elizabeth P.

2,BRC,BRADY CORP,2020-09-16,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
Investors should carefully consider the risks set forth below and all other information contained in this report and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as market conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in 6Table of Contentsinterest rates, terrorism, wars or conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic or business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business and financial results.Business RisksOur results of operations have been and may in the future be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic or other pandemics, and the duration and extent to which it will impact our business and financial results remains uncertain.The global spread of COVID-19 has resulted in significant economic disruption, has negatively impacted our financial results, and significantly increased future uncertainty. The extent to which our business and financial results are further impacted will depend on numerous evolving factors which are uncertain and cannot be predicted, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals’ actions taken in response; the effect on our customers and customers’ demand for our services and products; the decrease in healthcare services provided; the effect on our suppliers and disruptions to the global supply chain; our ability to sell and manufacture our products; disruptions to our operations resulting from the illness of any of our employees; restrictions or disruptions to transportation, including reduced availability of ground or air transport; the ability of our customers to pay for our products; and any closures of our facilities, our suppliers’ facilities, and our customers’ facilities. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted and will result in additional expenses, lost or delayed revenue, and we have been experiencing disruptions to our business and additional expenses as we implement modifications to employee travel, work locations and cancellation of events, among other modifications. In addition, the deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may impact the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity and energy prices, and interest rates. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business and financial results due to any economic recession or depression that has occurred, and due to any major public health crises that may occur in the future.Although our current accounting estimates contemplate current and expected future conditions, as applicable, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could differ from our expectations, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial position. In particular, a number of estimates have been and will continue to be affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The severity, magnitude and duration, as well as the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, are uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict. As a result, our accounting estimates and assumptions may change over time in response to COVID-19. Such changes could result in future impairments of goodwill, intangible assets, long-lived assets, incremental credit losses on accounts receivable, excess and obsolete inventory, or a decrease in the carrying amount of our deferred tax assets. Any of these events could amplify the other risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020 and could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.Demand for our products may be adversely affected by numerous factors, some of which we cannot predict or control. This could adversely affect our business and financial results.Numerous factors may affect the demand for our products, including:•Deterioration of economic conditions in major markets served.•Ongoing economic and operational impact of the COVID-19 or other pandemics.•Consolidation in the marketplace allowing competitors to be more efficient and more price competitive.•Competitors entering the marketplace.•Decreasing product life cycles.•Changes in customer preferences.•Ability to achieve operational excellence.If any of these factors occur, the demand for our products could suffer, and this could adversely impact our business and financial results.Failure to compete effectively or to successfully execute our strategy may have a negative impact on our business and financial results.We actively compete with companies that produce and market the same or similar products, and in some instances, with companies that sell different products that are designed for the same end user. Competition may force us to reduce prices or incur additional costs to remain competitive in an environment in which business models are changing rapidly. We compete on the basis of several factors, including customer support, product innovation, product offering, product quality, price, expertise, digital capabilities, production capabilities, and for multinational customers, our global footprint. Present or future competitors may develop and introduce new and enhanced products, offer products based on alternative technologies and processes, accept 7Table of Contentslower profit, have greater financial, technical or other resources, or have lower production costs or other pricing advantages. Any of these could put us at a disadvantage by threatening our share of sales or reducing our profit margins, which could adversely impact our business and financial results.Additionally, throughout our global business, distributors and customers may seek lower cost sourcing opportunities, which could result in a loss of business that may adversely impact our business and financial results.Our strategy is to expand into higher-growth adjacent product categories and markets with technologically advanced new products, as well as to grow our sales generated through the digital channel. While traditional direct marketing channels such as catalogs are an important means of selling our products, an increasing number of customers are purchasing products on the internet. Our strategy to increase sales through the digital channel is an investment in our internet sales capabilities. There is a risk that we may not continue to successfully implement this strategy, or if successfully implemented, not realize its expected benefits due to the continued levels of increased competition and pricing pressure brought about by the internet. Our failure to successfully implement our strategy could adversely impact our business and financial results.Failure to develop technologically advanced products that meet customer demands, including price expectations, could adversely impact our business and financial results.Development of technologically advanced new products is targeted as a driver of our organic growth and profitability. Technology is changing rapidly and our competitors are innovating quickly. If we do not keep pace with developing technologically advanced products, we risk product commoditization, deterioration of the value of our brand, and reduced ability to effectively compete. We must continue to develop innovative products, as well as acquire and retain the necessary intellectual property rights in these products. If we fail to innovate, or we launch products with quality problems, or if customers do not accept our products, then our business and financial results could be adversely affected.Raw material and other cost increases could adversely affect our business and financial results.We manufacture certain parts and components of our products and therefore require raw materials from suppliers, which could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. Prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated in the past and significant increases could adversely affect our profit margins and results of operations. Changes in trade policies, shortages due to the COVID-19 or other pandemics, the imposition of duties and tariffs and potential retaliatory countermeasures could adversely impact the price or availability of raw materials. In addition, labor shortages or an increase in the cost of labor could adversely affect our profit margins and results of operations. Due to pricing pressure or other factors, the Company may not be able to pass along increased raw material and component part costs to its customers in the form of price increases or its ability to do so could be delayed, which could adversely impact our business and financial results.Our failure or the failure of third-party service providers to protect our sites, networks and systems against security breaches, to protect our confidential information, or to facilitate our digital strategy, could adversely affect our business and financial results. Our business systems collect, transmit and store data about our customers, vendors and others, including credit card information and personally identifiable information. We also employ third-party service providers that store, process and transmit proprietary, personal and confidential information on our behalf. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties in an effort to securely transmit confidential and sensitive information, including credit card numbers. Our security measures, and those of our third-party service providers, may not detect or prevent all attempts to hack our systems, denial-of-service attacks, viruses, malicious software, break-ins, phishing attacks, social engineering, security breaches or other similar disruptions that may jeopardize the security of information stored in or transmitted by our sites, networks and systems or that we or our third-party service providers otherwise maintain. We engage third-party service providers to assist with certain of our website and digital platform upgrades, which may result in a decline in sales when initially deployed, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.We and our service providers may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent all types of attacks, and techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or to sabotage systems change frequently and may not be known until launched against us or our third-party service providers. In addition, security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships. Although we maintain privacy, data breach and network security liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate or will cover liabilities actually incurred, or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Any compromise or breach of our security measures, or those of our third-party service providers, could adversely impact our ability to conduct business, violate applicable privacy, data security and other 8Table of Contentslaws, and cause significant legal and financial exposure, adverse publicity, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.We are a global company headquartered in the United States. We are subject to extensive regulations by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and self-regulatory entities at various levels of the governing bodies. Failure to comply with laws and regulations could adversely affect our business and financial results.Approximately 45% of our sales are derived outside of the United States. Our operations are subject to the risks of doing business domestically and globally, including the following:•Delays or disruptions in product deliveries and payments in connection with international manufacturing and sales.•Regulations resulting from political and economic instability and disruptions.•Imposition of new, or change in existing, duties, tariffs and trade agreements, which could have a direct or indirect impact on our ability to manufacture products, on our customers' demand for our products, or on our suppliers' ability to deliver raw materials.•Import, export and economic sanction laws.•Current and changing governmental policies, regulatory, and business environments.•Disadvantages from competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.•Local labor regulations.•Regulations relating to climate change, air emissions, wastewater discharges, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes.•Regulations relating to product content, health, safety and the protection of the environment.•Imposition of trade or travel restrictions as a result of the COVID-19 or other pandemics.•Specific country regulations where our products are manufactured or sold.•Regulations relating to compliance with data protection and privacy laws throughout our global business.•Laws and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government, including audit requirements of government contracts related to procurement integrity, export control, employment practices, and the accuracy of records and recording of costs.Further, these laws and regulations are constantly evolving and it is difficult to accurately predict the effect they may have upon our business and financial results.We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims rules, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. Any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and related lawsuits by shareholders and others, damage our reputation, and adversely impact our business and financial results. We depend on key employees and the loss of these individuals could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our key executives, managers and other skilled employees. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain our key executives, managers and employees. The departure of key personnel without adequate replacement could disrupt our business operations. Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical and industry experience to operate our business successfully. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our costs to do so increase significantly, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. Divestitures, contingent liabilities from divested businesses and the failure to properly identify, integrate and grow acquired companies could adversely affect our business and financial results. We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that we determine do not align with our strategic plan, or that are not achieving the desired return on investment. Divestitures pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business. When we decide to sell a business or specific assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms or within our anticipated time-frame, and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell a business, the sale is typically subject to pre-closing conditions which may not be satisfied. In addition, the impact of the divestiture on our revenue and net income may be larger than projected, which could distract management, and disputes may arise with buyers. We have retained responsibility for and have agreed to indemnify buyers against certain contingent liabilities related to several 9Table of Contentsbusinesses that we have sold. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse impact on our financial results, but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue.Our historical growth has included acquisitions, and our future growth strategy may include acquisitions. If our future growth strategy includes a focus on acquisitions, we may not be able to identify acquisition targets or successfully complete acquisitions due to the absence of quality companies in our target markets, economic conditions, or price expectations from sellers. Acquisitions place significant demands on management, operational, and financial resources. Future acquisitions will require integration of operations, sales and marketing, information technology, and administrative operations, which could decrease the time available to focus on our other growth strategies. We cannot assure that we will be able to successfully integrate acquisitions, that these acquisitions will operate profitably, or that we will be able to achieve the desired sales growth or operational success. Our business and financial results could be adversely affected if we do not successfully integrate the newly acquired businesses, or if our other businesses suffer due to the increased focus on the acquired businesses.We are subject to litigation, including product liability claims that could adversely impact our business, financial results, and reputation.We are a party to litigation that arises in the normal course of our business operations, including product liability and recall (strict liability and negligence) claims, patent and trademark matters, contract disputes and environmental, employment and other litigation matters. We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other damage. In addition, we face an inherent risk that our competitors will allege that aspects of our products infringe their intellectual property or that our intellectual property is invalid, such that we could be prevented from manufacturing and selling our products or prevented from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products. To date, we have not incurred material costs related to these types of claims. However, while we currently maintain insurance coverage for certain types of claims that we believe is adequate, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms or that this insurance will provide sufficient coverage against potential liabilities that may arise. Any claims brought against us, with or without merit, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and reputation as a result of potential adverse outcomes. The expenses associated with defending such claims and the diversion of our management’s resources and time may have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.Financial/Ownership RisksThe global nature of our business exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations that could adversely affect our business and financial results.Approximately 45% of our sales are derived outside the United States. Sales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S. dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, and may adversely affect our financial results. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in currencies other than U.S. dollars into other countries. Decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials, products, and services purchased overseas. Our sales and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects, which occurred during fiscal years 2019 and 2020. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries may invoice customers in a currency other than its functional currency or may be invoiced by suppliers in a currency other than its functional currency, which could result in unfavorable translation effects on our business and financial results.Failure to execute our strategies could result in impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, which may negatively impact income and profitability. We have goodwill of $416.0 million and other intangible assets of $22.3 million as of July 31, 2020, which represents 38.4% of our total assets, and we have recognized impairment charges in the past. We evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present, based upon the fair value of each respective asset. The valuations prepared for the required impairment test include management's estimates of sales, profitability, cash flow generation, capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditures, and other assumptions. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to achieve sales projections or cost savings, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected changes in the use of the assets, and divestitures may adversely impact the assumptions used in the valuations. If the estimated fair value of our goodwill or other intangible assets change in future periods, we may be required to record an impairment charge, which would reduce net income in such period.10Table of ContentsChanges in tax legislation or tax rates could adversely affect results of operations and financial statements. Additionally, audits by taxing authorities could result in tax payments for prior periods.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many non-U.S. jurisdictions. As such, our income is subject to risk due to changing tax laws and tax rates around the world. Our tax filings are subject to audit by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. If these audits result in payments or assessments that differ from our reserves, our future net income may be adversely impacted.We review the probability of the realization of our deferred tax assets quarterly based on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. As part of this review, we utilize historical results, projected future operating results, eligible carry-forward periods, tax planning opportunities, and other relevant considerations. Changes in profitability and financial outlook in both the U.S. and/or foreign jurisdictions, or changes in our geographic footprint may require modifications in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. At any point in time, there are a number of tax proposals at various stages of legislation throughout the globe. While it is impossible for us to predict whether some or all of these proposals will be enacted, many will likely have an impact on our business and financial results.Substantially all of our voting stock is controlled by two shareholders, while our public investors hold non-voting stock. The interests of the voting and non-voting shareholders could differ, potentially resulting in decisions that affect the value of the non-voting shares.Substantially all of our voting stock is controlled by Elizabeth P. Bruno, one of our Directors, and William H. Brady III, both of whom are descendants of the Company's founder. All of our publicly traded shares are non-voting. Therefore, the voting shareholders have control in most matters requiring approval or acquiescence by shareholders, including the composition of our Board of Directors and many corporate actions, and their interests may not align with those of the non-voting shareholders. Such concentration of ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a purchase offer that our public shareholders may find favorable and it may adversely affect the trading price for our non-voting common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies whose voting stock is controlled by a limited number of shareholders. Additionally, certain mutual funds and index sponsors have implemented rules restricting ownership, or excluding from indices, companies with non-voting publicly traded shares"

Investors should carefully consider the risks set forth below and all other information contained in this report and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as market conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, wars or conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic or business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business and financial results.Business RisksFailure to compete effectively or to successfully execute our strategy may have a negative impact on our business and financial results.We actively compete with companies that produce and market the same or similar products, and in some instances, with companies that sell different products that are designed for the same end user. Competition may force us to reduce prices or incur additional costs to remain competitive in an environment in which business models are changing rapidly. We compete on the basis of several factors, including customer support, product innovation, product offering, product quality, price, expertise, digital capabilities, production capabilities, and for multinational customers, our global footprint. Present or future competitors may develop and introduce new and enhanced products, offer products based on alternative technologies and processes, accept lower profit, have greater financial, technical or other resources, or have lower production costs or other pricing advantages. Any of these could put us at a disadvantage by threatening our share of sales or reducing our profit margins, which could adversely impact our business and financial results. Additionally, throughout our global business, distributors and customers may seek lower cost sourcing opportunities, which could result in a loss of business that may adversely impact our business and financial results.Our strategy is to expand into higher-growth adjacent product categories and markets with technologically advanced new products, as well as to grow our sales generated through the digital channel. While traditional direct marketing channels such as catalogs are an important means of selling our products, an increasing number of customers are purchasing products on the internet. Our strategy to increase sales through the digital channel is an investment in our internet sales capabilities. There is a risk that we may not continue to successfully implement this strategy, or if successfully implemented, not realize its expected benefits due to the continued levels of increased competition and pricing pressure brought about by the internet. Our failure to successfully implement our strategy could adversely impact our business and financial results.Failure to develop technologically advanced products that meet customer demands, including price expectations, could adversely impact our business and financial results.Development of technologically advanced new products is targeted as a driver of our organic growth and profitability.

This could adversely affect our business and financial results.Numerous factors may affect the demand for our products, including:•Economic conditions of major markets served.•Consolidation in the marketplace allowing competitors to be more efficient and more price competitive.•Competitors entering the marketplace.•Decreasing product life cycles.•Changes in customer preferences.•Ability to achieve operational excellence.If any of these factors occur, the demand for our products could suffer, and this could adversely impact our business and financial results.Raw material and other cost increases could adversely affect our business and financial results.We manufacture certain parts and components of our products and therefore require raw materials from suppliers, which could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing.

If these audits result in payments or assessments that differ from our reserves, our future net income may be adversely impacted.On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”). The changes included in the Tax Reform Act are broad and complex, and regulations have been issued to address implementation of the Tax Reform Act which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. Additionally, longstanding international tax norms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are evolving as a result of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting reporting requirements recommended by the G7, G20 and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. As these and other tax laws and related regulations change, our financial results could be materially impacted.We review the probability of the realization of our deferred tax assets quarterly based on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. As part of this review, we utilize historical results, projected future operating results, eligible carry-forward periods, tax planning opportunities, and other relevant considerations. Changes in profitability and financial outlook in both the U.S. and/or foreign jurisdictions, or changes in our geographic footprint may require modifications in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. During the year ended July 31, 2018, we recorded a valuation allowance of $21.4 million against our foreign tax credit carryforwards primarily due to the passage of the Tax Reform Act, which changed our ability to utilize foreign tax credits in future periods. At any point in time, there are a number of tax proposals at various stages of legislation throughout the globe. While it is impossible for us to predict whether some or all of these proposals will be enacted, many will likely have an impact on our business and financial results.9Table of ContentsFailure to execute our strategies could result in impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, which may negatively impact income and profitability.

Our security measures, and those of our third-party service providers, may not detect or prevent all attempts to hack our systems, denial-of-service attacks, viruses, malicious software, break-ins, phishing attacks, social engineering, security breaches or other attacks and similar disruptions that may jeopardize the security of information stored in or transmitted by our sites, networks and systems or that we or our third-party service providers otherwise maintain. We and our service providers may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent all types of attacks, and techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and may not be known until launched against us or our third-party service providers. In addition, security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships. Although we maintain privacy, data breach and network security liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate or cover liabilities actually incurred, or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Any compromise or breach of our security measures, or those of our third-party service providers, could adversely impact our ability to conduct business, violate applicable privacy, data security and other laws, and cause significant legal and financial exposure, adverse publicity, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.Demand for our products may be adversely affected by numerous factors, some of which we cannot predict or control. This could adversely affect our business and financial results.Numerous factors may affect the demand for our products, including:•Future economic conditions of major markets served.•Consolidation in the marketplace allowing competitors and customers to be more efficient and more price competitive.•Future competitors entering the marketplace.•Decreasing product life cycles.•Changes in customer preferences.•Ability to achieve operational excellence.If any of these factors occur, the demand for our products could suffer, and this could adversely impact our business and financial results.The loss of large customers or a significant reduction in sales to large customers could adversely affect our business and financial results.While we have a broad customer base and no individual customer represents 10% or more of total sales, we conduct business with several large customers and distribution companies. Our dependence on these customers makes relationships with them important. We cannot guarantee that these relationships will be retained in the future. Because these large customers account for a significant portion of sales, they may possess a greater capacity to negotiate reduced prices. If we are unable to provide products to our customers at the quality and prices acceptable to them, some of our customers may shift their business to competitors or may substitute another manufacturer's products. If one of our large customers consolidates, is acquired, or loses market share, the result of that event may have an adverse impact on our business. The loss of or reduction of business from one or more of these large customers could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.7Table of ContentsWe are a global company headquartered in the United States. We are subject to extensive regulations by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and self-regulatory entities at various levels of the governing bodies. Failure to comply with laws and regulations could adversely affect our business and financial results.Our operations are subject to the risks of doing business domestically and globally, including the following:•Delays or disruptions in product deliveries and payments in connection with international manufacturing and sales.•Regulations resulting from political and economic instability and disruptions.•Imposition of new, or change in existing, duties, tariffs and trade agreements.•Import, export and economic sanction laws.•Current and changing governmental policies, regulatory, and business environments.•Disadvantages from competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.•Local labor regulations.•Regulations relating to climate change, air emissions, wastewater discharges, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes.•Regulations relating to product content, health, safety and the protection of the environment.•Specific country regulations where our products are manufactured or sold.•Regulations relating to compliance with data protection and privacy laws throughout our global business.•Laws and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government, including audit requirements of government contracts related to procurement integrity, export control, employment practices, and the accuracy of records and recording of costs.Further, these laws and regulations are constantly evolving and it is difficult to accurately predict the effect they may have upon our business and financial results.We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims rules, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. Any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and related lawsuits by shareholders and others, damage our reputation, and adversely impact our business and financial results. We depend on key employees and the loss of these individuals could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our key executives, managers and other skilled employees. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain our key executives, managers and employees. The departure of key personnel without adequate replacement could disrupt our business operations. Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical and industry experience to operate our business successfully. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our costs to do so increase significantly, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. Divestitures, contingent liabilities from divested businesses and the failure to properly identify, integrate and grow acquired companies could adversely affect our business and financial results. We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that we determine do not align with our strategic plan, or that are not achieving the desired return on investment. Divestitures pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business. When we decide to sell a business or assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms and within our anticipated time-frame, and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell a business, the sale is typically subject to pre-closing conditions which may not be satisfied. In addition, the impact of the divestiture on our revenue and net earnings may be larger than projected, which could distract management, and disputes may arise with buyers. We have retained responsibility for and have agreed to indemnify buyers against certain contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses that we have sold. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse impact on our financial results, but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue.Our historical growth has included acquisitions, and our future growth strategy may include acquisitions. If our future growth strategy includes a focus on acquisitions, we may not be able to identify acquisition targets or successfully complete acquisitions due to the absence of quality companies in our target markets, economic conditions, or price expectations from sellers. Acquisitions place significant demands on management, operational, and financial resources. Future acquisitions will require integration of operations, sales and marketing, information technology, and administrative operations, which could decrease the time available to focus on our other growth strategies. We cannot assure that we will be able to successfully integrate acquisitions, that these 8Table of Contentsacquisitions will operate profitably, or that we will be able to achieve the desired sales growth or operational success. Our business and financial results could be adversely affected if we do not successfully integrate the newly acquired businesses, or if our other businesses suffer due to the increased focus on the acquired businesses.We are subject to litigation, including product liability claims that could adversely impact our business, financial results, and reputation.We are a party to litigation that arises in the normal course of our business operations, including product warranty, product liability and recall (strict liability and negligence) claims, patent and trademark matters, contract disputes and environmental, employment and other litigation matters. We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability and warranty claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other damage. In addition, we face an inherent risk that our competitors will allege that aspects of our products infringe their intellectual property or that our intellectual property is invalid, such that we could be prevented from manufacturing and selling our products or prevented from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products. To date, we have not incurred material costs related to these types of claims. However, while we currently maintain insurance coverage in amounts that we believe are adequate, we cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms or that this insurance will provide sufficient coverage against potential liabilities that may arise. Any claims brought against us, with or without merit, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and reputation as a result of potential adverse outcomes. The expenses associated with defending such claims and the diversion of our management’s resources and time may have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.Failure to execute facility consolidations or maintain acceptable operational service metrics may adversely impact our business and financial results.We continually assess our global footprint and expect to implement additional measures to reduce our cost structure, simplify our business, and standardize our processes, and these actions could result in unplanned operating costs and business disruptions in the future. In addition, the Company is reliant upon certain suppliers for certain raw or finished products. If we experience service disruptions with these suppliers, or if we fail to successfully address these inefficiencies, their effects could adversely impact our business and financial results.Financial/Ownership RisksThe global nature of our business exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations that could adversely affect our business and financial results.Approximately 50% of our sales are derived outside the United States. Sales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S. dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, and may adversely affect our financial results. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in currencies other than U.S. dollars into other countries. Decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials, products, and services purchased overseas. Our sales and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, and the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects, which occurred during fiscal years 2016 and 2017. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries may invoice customers in a currency other than its functional currency or may be invoiced by suppliers in a currency other than its functional currency, which could result in unfavorable translation effects on our business and financial results.Changes in tax legislation or tax rates could adversely affect results of operations and financial statements. Additionally, audits by taxing authorities could result in tax payments for prior periods.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many non-U.S. jurisdictions. As such, our earnings are subject to risk due to changing tax laws and tax rates around the world. Our tax filings are subject to audit by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. If these audits result in payments or assessments that differ from our reserves, our future net earnings may be adversely impacted.On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”). The changes included in the Tax Reform Act are broad and complex. The final transition impacts of the Tax Reform Act may differ from the provisional estimates provided due to changes in interpretations, any legislative action to address questions that arise, any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations, or any updates or changes to estimates we have utilized to calculate the transition impacts. Additionally, longstanding international tax norms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are evolving as a result of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting reporting requirements recommended by the G8, G20 and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. As these and other tax laws and related regulations change, our financial results could be materially impacted. Given 9Table of Contentsthe unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency, it is difficult to assess the overall effect of such potential tax changes on our earnings and cash flow, but such changes could adversely impact our financial results.We review the probability of the realization of our deferred tax assets quarterly based on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. As part of this review, we utilize historical results, projected future operating results, eligible carry-forward periods, tax planning opportunities, and other relevant considerations. Adverse changes in profitability and financial outlook in both the U.S. and/or foreign jurisdictions, or changes in our geographic footprint may require changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. During the year ended July 31, 2018, we recorded a valuation allowance of $21.4 million against our foreign tax credit carryforwards primarily due to the passage of the Tax Reform Act, which modifies our ability to utilize foreign tax credits in future periods. At any point in time, there are a number of tax proposals at various stages of legislation throughout the globe. While it is impossible for us to predict whether some or all of these proposals will be enacted, it likely would have an impact on our results of operations and our consolidated financial statements.Failure to execute our strategies could result in impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, which may negatively impact earnings and profitability. We have goodwill of $419.8 million and other intangible assets of $42.6 million as of July 31, 2018, which represents 43.7% of our total assets. We evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present, based upon the fair value of each respective asset. These valuations include management's estimates of sales, profitability, cash flow generation, capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditures, and other assumptions. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to achieve sales projections or cost savings, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets or in entity structure, and divestitures may adversely impact the assumptions used in the valuations. If the estimated fair value of our goodwill or other intangible assets change in future periods, we may be required to record an impairment charge, which would reduce the earnings in such period.Substantially all of our voting stock is controlled by members of the Brady family, while our public investors hold non-voting stock. The interests of the voting and non-voting shareholders could differ, potentially resulting in decisions that unfavorably affect the value of the non-voting shares.Substantially all of our voting stock is controlled by Elizabeth P. Bruno, one of our Directors, and William H. Brady III, both of whom are descendants of the Company's founder. All of our publicly traded shares are non-voting. Therefore, Ms. Bruno and Mr. Brady have control in most matters requiring approval or acquiescence by shareholders, including the composition of our Board of Directors and many corporate actions. Such concentration of ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a purchase offer that our public shareholders may find favorable, which in turn could adversely affect the market price of our common stock or prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium over our stock price. Certain mutual funds and index sponsors have implemented rules restricting ownership, or excluding from indices, companies with non-voting publicly traded shares. Furthermore, this concentration of voting share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our non-voting common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies whose voting stock is controlled by a limited number of shareholders.Failure to meet certain financial covenants required by our debt agreements may adversely affect our business and financial results.As of July 31, 2018, we had $52.6 million in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, based on the availability under our credit facilities as of July 31, 2018, we had the ability to borrow an additional $297.0 million under our revolving credit agreement. Our current revolving credit agreement and long-term debt obligations also impose certain restrictions on us. Refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations within Item 7 for more information regarding our credit agreement and long-term debt obligations. If we breach any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then, subject to applicable cure periods, the outstanding indebtedness and any other indebtedness with cross-default provisions could be declared immediately due and payable, which could adversely affect our financial results"
1,BRC,BRADY CORP,2017-09-13,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
Investors should carefully consider the risks set forth below and all other information contained in this report and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as market conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, wars or conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic or business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business and financial results.Business RisksFailure to compete effectively or to successfully execute our strategy may have a negative impact on our business and financial results.We actively compete with companies that produce and market the same or similar products, and in some instances, with companies that sell different products that are designed for the same end user. Competition may force us to reduce prices or incur additional costs to remain competitive in an environment in which business models are changing rapidly. We compete on the basis of price, customer support, product innovation, product offering, product quality, expertise, digital capabilities, production capabilities, and for multinational customers, our global footprint. Present or future competitors may develop and introduce new and enhanced products, offer products based on alternative technologies and processes, accept lower profit, have greater financial, technical or other resources, or have lower production costs or other pricing advantages. Any of these could put us at a disadvantage by threatening our share of sales or reducing our profit margins, which could adversely impact our business and financial results. 6Table of ContentsAdditionally, throughout our global business, distributors and customers may seek lower cost sourcing opportunities, which could result in a loss of business that may adversely impact our business and financial results.Our strategy is to expand into higher-growth adjacent product categories and markets with technologically advanced new products, as well as to grow our sales generated through the digital channel. While traditional direct marketing channels such as catalogs are an important means of selling our products, an increasing number of customers are purchasing products on the internet. Our strategy to increase sales through the digital channel is an investment in our internet sales capabilities. There is a risk that we may not continue to successfully implement this strategy, or if successfully implemented, not realize its expected benefits due to the continued levels of increased competition and pricing pressure brought about by the internet. Our failure to successfully implement our strategy could adversely impact our business and financial results.Failure to develop technologically advanced products that meet customer demands, including price expectations, could adversely impact our business and financial results.Development of technologically advanced new products is targeted as a driver of our organic growth and profitability. Technology is changing rapidly and our competitors are innovating quickly. If we do not keep pace with developing technologically advanced products, we risk product commoditization, deterioration of the value of our brand, and reduced ability to effectively compete. We must continue to develop innovative products, as well as acquire and retain the necessary intellectual property rights in these products. If we fail to make innovations, or we launch products with quality problems, or if customers do not accept our products, then our business and financial results could be adversely affected.Our failure or the failure of third-party service providers to protect our sites, networks and systems against security breaches, or otherwise to protect our confidential information, could adversely affect our business and financial results. Our business systems collect, maintain, transmit and store data about our customers, vendors and others, including credit card information and personally identifiable information, as well as other confidential and proprietary information. We also employ third-party service providers that store, process and transmit proprietary, personal and confidential information on our behalf. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties in an effort to securely transmit confidential and sensitive information, including credit card numbers. Our security measures, and those of our third-party service providers, may not detect or prevent all attempts to hack our systems, denial-of-service attacks, viruses, malicious software, break-ins, phishing attacks, social engineering, security breaches or other attacks and similar disruptions that may jeopardize the security of information stored in or transmitted by our sites, networks and systems or that we or our third-party service providers otherwise maintain. We and our service providers may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent all types of attacks, and techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and may not be known until launched against us or our third-party service providers. In addition, security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships. Although we maintain privacy, data breach and network security liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate or cover liabilities actually incurred, or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Any compromise or breach of our security measures, or those of our third-party service providers, could adversely impact our ability to conduct business, violate applicable privacy, data security and other laws, and cause significant legal and financial exposure, adverse publicity, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.Demand for our products may be adversely affected by numerous factors, some of which we cannot predict or control. This could adversely affect our business and financial results.Numerous factors may affect the demand for our products, including:•Future economic conditions of major markets served.•Consolidation in the marketplace allowing competitors and customers to be more efficient and more price competitive.•Future competitors entering the marketplace.•Decreasing product life cycles.•Changes in customer preferences.If any of these factors occur, the demand for our products could suffer, and this could adversely impact our business and financial results.7Table of ContentsThe loss of large customers or a significant reduction in sales to large customers could adversely affect our business and financial results.While we have a broad customer base and no individual customer represents 10% or more of total sales, we conduct business with several large customers and distribution companies.

Any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and related lawsuits by shareholders and others, damage our reputation, and adversely impact our business and financial results. Failure to execute facility consolidations or maintain acceptable operational service metrics may adversely impact our business and financial results.In prior fiscal years, we incurred unplanned operating costs related to the consolidation of certain facilities and we experienced a deterioration in key customer service metrics. We continually assess our global footprint and expect to implement additional measures to reduce our cost structure, simplify our business, and standardize our processes, and these actions could result in unplanned operating costs and business disruptions in the future. In addition, the Company is reliant upon certain suppliers for certain raw or finished products. If we experience service disruptions with these suppliers, or if we fail to successfully address these inefficiencies, their effects could adversely impact our business and financial results.8Table of ContentsWe are subject to litigation, including product liability claims that could adversely impact our business, financial results, and reputation.We are a party to litigation that arises in the normal course of our business operations, including product warranty, product liability and recall (strict liability and negligence) claims, patent and trademark matters, contract disputes and environmental, employment and other litigation matters.

Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical and industry experience to operate our business successfully. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our costs to do so increase significantly, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. Divestitures, contingent liabilities from divested businesses and the failure to properly identify, integrate and grow acquired companies could adversely affect our business and financial results. We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that we determine do not align with our strategic plan, or that are not achieving the desired return on investment. For example, during fiscal years 2014 and 2015, we divested our Asian Die-Cut and European Die-Cut businesses. Divestitures pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business. When we decide to sell a business or assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms and within our anticipated time-frame, and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell a business, the sale is typically subject to pre-closing conditions which may not be satisfied. In addition, the impact of the divestiture on our revenue and net earnings may be larger than projected, which could distract management, and disputes may arise with buyers. We have retained responsibility for and have agreed to indemnify buyers against certain contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses that we have sold. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse impact on our financial results, but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue.Our historical growth has included acquisitions, and our future growth strategy may include acquisitions. If our future growth strategy includes a focus on acquisitions, we may not be able to identify acquisition targets or successfully complete acquisitions due to the absence of quality companies in our target markets, economic conditions, or price expectations from sellers. Acquisitions place significant demands on management, operational, and financial resources. Future acquisitions will require integration of operations, sales and marketing, information technology, and administrative operations, which could decrease the time available to focus on our other growth strategies. We cannot assure that we will be able to successfully integrate acquisitions, that these acquisitions will operate profitably, or that we will be able to achieve the desired sales growth or operational success. Our business and financial results could be adversely affected if we do not successfully integrate the newly acquired businesses, or if our other businesses suffer due to the increased focus on the acquired businesses.Financial/Ownership RisksThe global nature of our business exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations that could adversely affect our business and financial results.Approximately 45% of our sales are derived outside the United States. Sales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S. dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, and may adversely affect our financial results. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in currencies other than U.S. dollars into other countries. Decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials, products, and services purchased overseas. Our sales and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, and the strengthening or weakening of 9Table of Contentsthe U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects, which occurred during fiscal years 2015, 2016 and 2017.

As part of this review, we utilize historical results, projected future operating results, eligible carry-forward periods, tax planning opportunities, and other relevant considerations. Adverse changes in profitability and financial outlook in both the U.S. and/or foreign jurisdictions, or changes in our geographic footprint may require changes in the valuation allowances for deferred tax assets. Such changes could result in a material impact on earnings. Our annual cash needs could require us to repatriate cash to the U.S. from foreign jurisdictions, which may result in tax charges.  Potential tax reform discussed by the U.S. administration, such as reducing the corporate income tax rate, adopting a border-adjustability tax system, or changing the repatriation and taxation of foreign earnings, may impact income tax expenses, deferred tax assets in the U.S. and tax liability balances.Failure to execute our strategies could result in impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, which may negatively impact earnings and profitability. We have goodwill of $437.7 million and other intangible assets of $53.1 million as of July 31, 2017, which represents 46.7% of our total assets. In fiscal year 2015, the Company recorded impairment charges of approximately $46.9 million primarily related to the goodwill and other intangible assets of multiple reporting units. We evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present, based upon the fair value of each respective asset. These valuations include management's estimates of sales, profitability, cash flow generation, capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditures, and other assumptions. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to achieve sales projections or cost savings, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets or in entity structure, and divestitures may adversely impact the assumptions used in the valuations.

Our business is also subject to general risk and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as market conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, wars or conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic or business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business and financial results.Business RisksFailure to compete effectively or to successfully execute our strategy may have a negative impact on our business and financial results.We actively compete with companies that produce and market the same or similar products, and in some instances, with companies that sell different products that are designed for the same end user. Competition may force us to reduce prices or incur additional costs to remain competitive. We compete on the basis of price, customer support, product innovation, product offering, product quality, expertise, production capabilities, and for multinational customers, our global footprint. Present or future competitors may develop and introduce new and enhanced products, offer products based on alternative technologies and processes, accept lower profit, have greater financial, technical or other resources, or have lower production costs or other pricing advantages. Any of these could put us at a disadvantage by threatening our share of sales or reducing our profit margins, which could adversely impact our business and financial results. Additionally, throughout our global business, distributors and customers may seek lower cost sourcing opportunities, which could result in a loss of business that may adversely impact our business and financial results.Our strategy is to expand into higher-growth adjacent product categories and markets with technologically advanced new products, as well as to grow our sales generated through the digital channel. While traditional direct marketing channels such as catalogs are an important means of selling our products, an increasing number of customers are purchasing products on the internet. Our strategy to increase sales through the digital channel is an investment in our internet sales capabilities. There is a risk that we may not continue to successfully implement this strategy, or if successfully implemented, not realize its expected benefits due to the continued levels of increased competition and pricing pressure brought about by the internet. Our failure to successfully implement our strategy could adversely impact our business and financial results.Failure to develop technologically advanced products that meet customer demands, including price expectations, could adversely impact our business and financial results.Development of technologically advanced new products is targeted as a driver of our organic growth and profitability. Technology is changing rapidly and our competitors are innovating quickly. If we do not keep pace with developing technologically advanced products, we risk product commoditization, deterioration of the value of our brand, and reduced ability to effectively compete. We must continue to develop innovative products, as well as acquire and retain the necessary intellectual property rights in these products. If we fail to make innovations, or we launch products with quality problems, or if customers do not accept our products, then our business and financial results could be adversely affected.Our failure or the failure of third-party service providers to protect our sites, networks and systems against security breaches, or otherwise to protect our confidential information, could adversely affect our business and financial results. Our business systems collect, maintain, transmit and store data about our customers, vendors and others, including credit card information and personally identifiable information, as well as other confidential and proprietary information. We also employ third-party service providers that store, process and transmit proprietary, personal and confidential information on our behalf. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties in an effort to securely transmit confidential and sensitive information, including credit card numbers. Our security measures, and those of our third-party service providers, may not detect or prevent all attempts to hack our systems, denial-of-service attacks, viruses, malicious software, break-ins, phishing attacks, social engineering, security breaches or other attacks and similar disruptions that may jeopardize the security of information stored in or transmitted by our sites, networks and systems or that we or our third-party service providers otherwise maintain. We and our service providers may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent all types of attacks, and techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and may not be known until launched against us or our third-party service providers. In addition, security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships. Although we maintain privacy, data breach and network security liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate or cover liabilities actually incurred, or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable 7Table of Contentsterms, or at all. Any compromise or breach of our security measures, or those of our third-party service providers, could adversely impact our ability to conduct business, violate applicable privacy, data security and other laws, and cause significant legal and financial exposure, adverse publicity, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse and material effect on our business and financial results.Deterioration of or instability in the global economy and financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial results.Our business and operating results could be affected by global economic conditions. When global economic conditions deteriorate or economic uncertainty continues, customers and potential customers may experience deterioration of their businesses, which may result in the delay or cancellation of plans to purchase our products. Our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuations in the businesses of our customers or potential customers could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results.Demand for our products may be adversely affected by numerous factors, some of which we cannot predict or control. This could adversely affect our business and financial results.Numerous factors may affect the demand for our products, including:•Future financial performance of major markets served.•Consolidation in the marketplace allowing competitors and customers to be more efficient and more price competitive.•Future competitors entering the marketplace.•Decreasing product life cycles.•Changes in customer preferences.If any of these factors occur, the demand for our products could suffer, and this could adversely impact our business and financial results.The loss of large customers could adversely affect our business and financial results.While we have a broad customer base and no individual customer represents 10% or more of total sales, we conduct business with several large customers and distribution companies. Our dependence on these customers makes relationships with them important. We cannot guarantee that these relationships will be retained in the future. Because these large customers account for a significant portion of sales, they may possess a greater capacity to negotiate reduced prices. If we are unable to provide products to our customers at the quality and prices acceptable to them, some of our customers may shift their business to competitors or may substitute another manufacturer's products. If one of our large customers consolidates, is acquired, or loses market share, the result of that event may have an adverse impact on our business. The loss of or reduction of business from one or more of these large customers could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results.We depend on key employees and the loss of these individuals could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our key executives, managers and other skilled employees. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain our key executives, managers and employees. The departure of key personnel without adequate replacement could disrupt our business operations. Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical and industry experience to operate our business successfully. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our costs to do so increase significantly, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. Failure to execute facility consolidations and maintain acceptable operational service metrics may adversely impact our business and financial results.In prior fiscal years, we incurred unplanned operating costs related to the consolidation of certain facilities and we experienced a deterioration in key customer service metrics. We continually assess our global footprint and expect to implement additional measures to reduce our cost structure, simplify our business, and standardize our processes, and these actions could result in unplanned operating costs and business disruptions in the future. If these risks materialize, or if we fail to successfully address these inefficiencies, their effects could adversely impact our business and financial results.8Table of ContentsWe are a global company headquartered in the United States. We are subject to extensive regulations by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and self-regulatory entities at various levels of the governing bodies. Failure to comply with laws and regulations could adversely affect our business and financial results.Our operations are subject to the risks of doing business domestically and globally, including the following:•Delays or disruptions in product deliveries and payments in connection with international manufacturing and sales.•Political and economic instability and disruptions.•Imposition of duties and tariffs.•Import, export and economic sanction laws.•Current and changing governmental policies, regulatory, and business environments.•Disadvantages from competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.•Local labor market conditions.•Regulations relating to climate change, air emissions, wastewater discharges, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes.•Regulations relating to health, safety and the protection of the environment.•Specific country regulations where our products are manufactured or sold.•Laws and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government, including audit requirements of government contracts related to procurement integrity, export control, employment practices, and the accuracy of records and recording of costs.Further, these laws and regulations are constantly evolving and it is impossible to accurately predict the effect they may have upon our business and financial results.We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims rules, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. Any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and related lawsuits by shareholders and others, could damage our reputation, and could adversely impact our business and financial results. We are subject to litigation, including product liability claims, that could adversely impact our business, financial results, and reputation.We are a party to litigation that arises in the normal course of our business operations, including product warranty, product liability and recall (strict liability and negligence) claims, patent and trademark matters, contract disputes and environmental, employment and other litigation matters. We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability and warranty claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other damage. In addition, we face an inherent risk that our competitors will allege that aspects of our products infringe their intellectual property or that our intellectual property is invalid, such that we could be prevented from manufacturing and selling our products or prevented from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products. To date, we have not incurred material costs related to these types of claims. However, while we currently maintain insurance coverage in amounts that we believe are adequate, we cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms or that this insurance will provide sufficient coverage against potential liabilities that may arise. Any claims brought against us, with or without merit, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and reputation as a result of potential adverse outcomes, the expenses associated with defending such claims, the diversion of our management’s resources and time and the potential adverse effect to our business and financial results.Divestitures, contingent liabilities from divested businesses and the failure to properly identify, integrate and grow acquired companies could adversely affect our business and financial results. We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that we determine do not align with our strategic plan, or that are not achieving the desired return on investment. For example, over the last three fiscal years, we divested our Asian Die-Cut and European Die-Cut businesses. Divestitures pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business. For example, when we decide to sell a business or assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms and within our anticipated time-frame, and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell a business, the sale is typically subject to pre-closing conditions which may not be satisfied. In addition, the impact of the divestiture on our revenue and net earnings may be larger than projected, which could distract management, and disputes may arise with buyers. Also, we have retained responsibility for and have agreed to indemnify buyers against certain contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses that we have sold. 9Table of ContentsThe resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse impact on our financial results, but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue.Our historical growth has included acquisitions, and our future growth strategy may include acquisition opportunities. If our future growth strategy includes a focus on acquisitions, we may not be able to identify acquisition targets or successfully complete acquisitions due to the absence of quality companies in our target markets, economic conditions, or price expectations from sellers. Acquisitions place significant demands on management, operational, and financial resources. Recent and future acquisitions will require integration of operations, sales and marketing, information technology, and administrative operations, which could decrease the time available to focus on our other growth strategies. We cannot assure that we will be able to successfully integrate acquisitions, that these acquisitions will operate profitably, or that we will be able to achieve the desired sales growth or operational success. Our business and financial results could be adversely affected if we do not successfully integrate the newly acquired businesses, or if our other businesses suffer due to the increased focus on the acquired businesses. Financial/Ownership RisksThe global nature of our business exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations that could adversely affect our business and financial results.Approximately 45% of our sales are derived outside the United States. Sales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S. dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, and may adversely affect our financial statements. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in currencies other than U.S. dollars into other countries. Decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials, products, and services purchased overseas. Our sales and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, and the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects, which occurred during the fiscal years 2015 and 2016. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries may invoice customers in a currency other than its functional currency, which could result in unfavorable translation effects on our business and financial results.Failure to execute our strategies could result in impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, which may negatively impact earnings and profitability.  We have goodwill of $429.9 million and other intangible assets of $59.8 million as of July 31, 2016, which represents 46.9% of our total assets. In fiscal years 2014 and 2015, the Company recorded impairment charges of approximately $195 million related to the goodwill and other intangible assets of multiple reporting units. We evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present, based upon the fair value of each respective asset. These valuations include management's estimates of sales, profitability, cash flow generation, capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditures, and other assumptions. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to achieve sales projections or cost savings, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets or in entity structure, and divestitures may adversely impact the assumptions used in the valuations. If the estimated fair value of our goodwill or other intangible assets change in future periods, we may be required to record an impairment charge, which would reduce the earnings in such period and potentially future earnings.Changes in tax legislation or tax rates could adversely affect results of operations and financial statements. Additionally, audits by taxing authorities could result in tax payments for prior periods.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many non-U.S. jurisdictions. As such, our earnings are subject to risk due to changing tax laws and tax rates around the world. At any point in time, there are a number of tax proposals at various stages of legislation throughout the globe. While it is impossible for us to predict whether some or all of these proposals will be enacted, it likely would have an impact on our earnings.Our tax filings are subject to audit by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. If these audits result in payments or assessments that differ from our reserves, our future net earnings may be adversely impacted.We review the probability of the realization of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis based on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. As part of this review, we utilize historical results, projected future operating results, eligible carry-forward periods, tax planning opportunities, and other relevant considerations. Adverse changes in profitability and financial outlook in both the U.S. and/or foreign jurisdictions, or changes in our geographic footprint may require changes in the valuation allowances in order to reduce our deferred tax assets. Such changes could result in a material impact on earnings.10Table of ContentsOur annual cash needs could require us to repatriate cash to the U.S. from foreign jurisdictions, which may result in tax charges. We had no such tax charges during the fiscal years 2015 or 2016. However, in fiscal 2014, we repatriated cash to the U.S. in connection with the sale of the Die Cut businesses, which resulted in a tax charge of $4.0 million in continuing operations.Substantially all of our voting stock is controlled by members of the Brady family, while our public investors hold non-voting stock. The interests of the voting and non-voting shareholders could differ, potentially resulting in decisions that unfavorably affect the value of the non-voting shares.Substantially all of our voting stock is controlled by Elizabeth Pungello Bruno, one of our Directors, and William H. Brady III, both of whom are descendants of the Company's founder.  All of our publicly traded shares are non-voting. Therefore, Ms. Bruno and Mr. Brady have control in most matters requiring approval or acquiescence by shareholders, including the composition of our Board of Directors and many corporate actions. Such concentration of ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a purchase offer that our public shareholders may find favorable, which in turn could adversely affect the market price of our common stock or prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium over our stock price.  Furthermore, this concentration of voting share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our non-voting common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies whose voting stock is controlled by a limited number of shareholders.Failure to meet certain financial covenants required by our debt agreements may adversely affect our business and financial results.As of July 31, 2016, we had $216.9 million in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, based on the availability under our credit facilities as of July 31, 2016, we had the ability to borrow an additional $183.7 million under our revolving credit agreement. Our current revolving credit agreement and long-term debt obligations also impose certain restrictions on us. Refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (""MD&A"") within Item 7 for more information regarding our credit agreement and long-term debt obligations. If we breach any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then subject to applicable cure periods, the outstanding indebtedness (and any other indebtedness with cross-default provisions) could be declared immediately due and payable, which could adversely affect our financial results"
13,BRC,BRADY CORP,2015-09-21,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
Investors should carefully consider the risks set forth below and all other information contained in this report and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risk and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as market conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, wars or conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic or business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, including our results of operations, liquidity and financial conditions.Business RisksFailure to successfully implement our Workplace Safety strategy, or if successfully implemented, failure to realize the benefits expected from the strategy, may adversely affect our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.In fiscal 2015, the Workplace Safety segment represented 31.2% of our total sales. Organic sales in the WPS segment declined 0.4% in fiscal 2015, 4.6% in fiscal 2014, and 7.0% in fiscal 2013, all compared to the same periods in the prior year. During fiscal 2015, we recorded impairment charges of $46.9 million primarily related to the goodwill and other intangible assets in the WPS Americas and WPS Asia-Pacific (""WPS APAC"") reporting units. The WPS segment has experienced a deterioration in sales and profits due to a reduction in direct catalog mailings, increased digital competition, and pricing adjustments. While traditional direct marketing channels such as catalogs are important means of selling WPS products, an increasing number of customers are purchasing products on the Internet. The Company's strategy to grow this business includes: a focus on workplace safety critical industries, expansion of our product offerings, further developed pricing capabilities, and increased investment in digital. There is a risk that the Company may not continue to successfully implement this strategy, or if successfully implemented, not realize its expected benefits, due to the continued levels of increased competition and pricing pressure brought about by the Internet.  Although the rate of sales decline has slowed over the past three years, there is also a risk that the Company may not be able to permanently reverse the downward trends in this business and return the segment to historic levels of sales and profits.  If these risks materialize, their effects could adversely impact our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.  Failure to develop technologically advanced products that meet customer demands (including price expectations) and expand into adjacent product categories and markets could adversely impact our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.Development of technologically advanced new products is targeted as a driver of our organic growth and profitability. Technology is changing rapidly and our competitors are innovating quickly. If we do not keep pace with developing technologically advanced products, we risk product commoditization, deterioration of the value of our brand, and reduced ability to effectively compete. We must continue to develop innovative products, as well as acquire and retain the necessary intellectual property rights in these products. If we fail to make innovations, or we launch products with quality problems, or if customers do not accept our products, then our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow, and liquidity could be adversely affected.In addition, our strategy is to expand into higher-growth adjacent product categories and markets with technologically advanced new products. New product development and marketing efforts, including entry in markets where we have limited or no prior experience, such as healthcare and leisure and entertainment, have inherent risks. There can be no assurance that we will successfully execute these strategies. If we are unable to gain market share or successfully expand into adjacent markets with innovative new products, our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow, and liquidity could be adversely affected. Failure to execute facility consolidations and maintain acceptable operational service metrics may adversely impact our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.During fiscal years 2014 and 2015, we incurred unplanned operating costs related to consolidation of certain facilities and experienced deterioration of key service metrics. We remain challenged by operating inefficiencies stemming from these actions, but we are focused on improvements and returning to prior service metrics. We continually assess our global footprint and expect to implement additional measures to reduce our cost structure, simplify our business, and standardize our processes, and these actions could result in unplanned operating costs and business disruptions in the future. If these risks materialize, or if we fail to successfully address these inefficiencies, their effects could adversely impact our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.7Table of ContentsOur failure or the failure of third-party service providers to protect our sites, networks and systems against security breaches, or otherwise to protect our confidential information, may substantially harm our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.   Our business systems collect, maintain, transmit and store data about our customers, vendors and others, including credit card information and personally identifiable information, as well as other confidential and proprietary information. We also employ third-party service providers that store, process and transmit proprietary, personal and confidential information on our behalf. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties in an effort to securely transmit confidential and sensitive information, including credit card numbers. Our security measures, and those of our third-party service providers, may not detect or prevent all attempts to hack our systems, denial-of-service attacks, viruses, malicious software, break-ins, phishing attacks, social engineering, security breaches or other attacks and similar disruptions that may jeopardize the security of information stored in or transmitted by our sites, networks and systems or that we or our third-party service providers otherwise maintain. We and our service providers may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent all types of attacks, and techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and may not be known until launched against us or our third-party service providers. In addition, security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships.  Although we maintain privacy, data breach and network security liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate or cover liabilities actually incurred, or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all.  Any compromise or breach of our security measures, or those of our third-party service providers, could adversely impact our ability to conduct business, violate applicable privacy, data security and other laws, and cause significant legal and financial exposure, adverse publicity, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse and material effect on our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.Failure to compete effectively or remain competitive may have a negative impact on our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.We actively compete with companies that produce and market the same or similar products, and in some instances, with companies that sell different products that are designed for the same end user. Additionally, we continue to face competition through the Internet in our entire business. Competition may force us to reduce prices or incur additional costs to remain competitive. We compete on the basis of price, customer support, product innovation, product offering, product quality, expertise, production capabilities, and for multinational customers, our global footprint. Present or future competitors may develop and introduce new and enhanced products, offer products based on alternative technologies and processes, accept lower profit,  have greater financial, technical or other resources, or lower production costs or have other pricing advantages. Any of these could put us at a disadvantage by threatening our share of sales or reducing our profit margins, which could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flow and liquidity. Additionally, throughout our global business, distributors and customers may seek lower cost sourcing opportunities, which could result in a loss of business that may adversely impact our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.  Deterioration of or instability in the global economy and financial markets may adversely affect our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.  Our business and operating results could be affected by global economic conditions. In fiscal 2015, our business was negatively impacted by the weak economy in Australia and Brazil. When global economic conditions deteriorate or economic uncertainty continues, customers and potential customers may experience deterioration of their businesses, which may result in the delay or cancellation of plans to purchase our products. Our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuations in the businesses of our customers or potential customers could have a material adverse impact on our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.The global nature of our business exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations that could adversely affect our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow, and liquidity.Nearly 45% of our sales are derived outside the United States. Sales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S. dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, and may adversely affect our financial statements. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in currencies other than U.S. dollars into other countries. Decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials, products, and services purchased overseas. Our sales and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, and the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects, which occurred in fiscal 2015. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries may invoice customers in a currency other than its functional currency, which could result in unfavorable translation effects on our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.8Table of ContentsDemand for our products may be adversely affected by numerous factors, some of which we cannot predict or control. This could adversely affect our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.Numerous factors may affect the demand for our products, including:•Future financial performance of major markets served.•Consolidation in the marketplace, allowing competitors and customers to be more efficient and more price competitive.•Future competitors entering the marketplace.•Decreasing product life cycles.                                                                 •Changes in customer preferences.If any of these factors occur, the demand for our products could suffer, and this could adversely impact our business, sales, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.A large customer loss could significantly affect our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow, and liquidity.While we have a broad customer base and no individual customer represents 5% or more of total sales, we conduct business with several large customers and distribution companies. Our dependence on these customers makes relationships with them important. We cannot guarantee that these relationships will be retained in the future. Because these large customers account for a significant portion of sales, they may possess a greater capacity to negotiate reduced prices. If we are unable to provide products to our customers at the quality and prices acceptable to them, some of our customers may shift their business to competitors or may substitute another manufacturer's products.

We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain our key executives, managers and employees. The departure of key personnel without adequate replacement could disrupt our business operations. Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical and industry experience to operate our business successfully. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our costs to do so increase significantly, our operations could be materially adversely affected.  We are a global company headquartered in the United States.   We are subject to extensive regulations by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and self-regulatory entities at various levels of the governing bodies. Failure to comply with laws and regulations could adversely affect our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.Our operations are subject to the risks of doing business domestically and globally, including the following:•Delays or disruptions in product deliveries and payments in connection with international manufacturing and sales.•Political and economic instability and disruptions.•Imposition of duties and tariffs.•Import, export and economic sanction laws.•Current and changing governmental policies,  regulatory, and business environments. •Disadvantages from competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.•Local labor market conditions.•Regulations relating to climate change, air emissions, wastewater discharges, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes.•Regulations relating to health, safety and the protection of the environment.•Specific country regulations where our products are manufactured or sold.•Laws and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government, including audit requirements of government contracts related to procurement integrity, export control, employment practices, and the accuracy of records and recording of costs.Further, these laws and regulations are constantly evolving and it is impossible to accurately predict the effect they may have upon our sales, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.9Table of ContentsWe cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims rules, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. Any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits, could damage our reputation, and could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity. Product liability claims could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and reputation.Our business exposes us to potential product liability risk, as well as warranty and recall claims that are inherent in the design, manufacture, sale and use of our products. We sell products in industries such as aerospace, defense, healthcare, chemical, and energy where the impact of product liability risk is high. To date, we have not incurred material costs related to these types of claims. However, in the event our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected and we are subject to such claims above the amount of insurance coverage, outside the scope of our coverage, or for which we do not have coverage, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as our reputation, could be materially and adversely affected. Divestitures could negatively impact our business and contingent liabilities from divested businesses could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.  We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that we determine do not align with our strategic plan, or that are not achieving the desired return on investment.  For example, over the last three fiscal years, we have divested our Brady Medical and Varitronics businesses, and our Asia Die-Cut and European Die-Cut businesses. Divestitures pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business. For example, when we decide to sell a business or assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms and within our anticipated time-frame, and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell a business, the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions which may not be satisfied. In addition, the impact of the divestiture on our revenue and net earnings may be larger than projected, which could distract management, and disputes may arise with buyers. Also, we have retained responsibility for and have agreed to indemnify buyers against some contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses that we have recently sold. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flow and liquidity, but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue.Inability to identify, complete, and integrate acquisitions and grow acquired companies, may adversely impact our sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.Our historical growth has included acquisitions, and our future growth strategy may include acquisition opportunities. For example, in fiscal 2013 the Company acquired Precision Dynamics Corporation (""PDC""), a manufacturer of identification products primarily for the healthcare sector, for $301.2 million. We have not met the sales growth synergies identified at the time of the PDC acquisition, which, in addition to other factors, resulted in the Company recording impairment charges of $148.6 million during fiscal 2014, primarily related to the goodwill and other intangible assets in the PeopleID reporting unit, which consists primarily of the PDC business. Failure to achieve these synergies for PDC or other acquired companies may adversely impact our sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity. We may not focus on acquisitions as part of our growth strategy, or if we do, we may not be able to identify acquisition targets or successfully complete acquisitions in the future due to the absence of quality companies in our target markets, economic conditions, or price expectations from sellers. If we do not complete additional acquisitions, our growth may be limited.Acquisitions place significant demands on management, operational, and financial resources. Recent and future acquisitions will require integration of operations, sales and marketing, information technology, and administrative operations, which could decrease the time available to focus on our other growth strategies. We cannot assure that we will be able to successfully integrate acquisitions, that these acquisitions will operate profitably, or that we will be able to achieve the desired sales growth or operational success. Our sales, results of operations, cash flow, and liquidity could be adversely affected if we do not successfully integrate the newly acquired businesses, or if our other businesses suffer due to the increased focus on the acquired businesses. 10Table of ContentsFinancial/Ownership RisksFailure to execute our strategies could result in impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, which may negatively impact earnings and profitability.  We have goodwill of $433.2 million and other intangible assets of $68.9 million as of July 31, 2015, which represents 47.2% of our total assets. Over the past three years, the Company has recorded impairment charges of approximately $400 million related to the goodwill and other intangible assets of multiple reporting units. We evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present, based upon the fair value of each reporting unit. We assess the impairment of other intangible assets on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present, based upon the expected future cash flows of the respective assets. These valuations include management's estimates of sales, profitability, cash flow generation, capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditures, and other assumptions. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to achieve sales projections or cost savings, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets or in entity structure, and divestitures may adversely impact the assumptions used in the valuations. If the estimated fair value of our reporting units changes in future periods, we may be required to record an impairment charge related to goodwill or other intangible assets, which would reduce earnings in such period.Changes in tax legislation or tax rates could adversely affect results of operations and financial statements. Additionally, audits by taxing authorities could result in tax payments for prior periods.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many non-U.S. jurisdictions. As such, our earnings are subject to risk due to changing tax laws and tax rates around the world. At any point in time, there are a number of tax proposals at various stages of legislation throughout the globe. While it is impossible for us to predict whether some or all of these proposals will be enacted, it likely would have an impact on our earnings.Our tax filings are subject to audit by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. If these audits result in payments or assessments that differ from our reserves, our future net earnings may be adversely impacted.We review the probability of the realization of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis based on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. As part of this review, we utilize historical results, projected future operating results, eligible carry-forward periods, tax planning opportunities, and other relevant considerations. Adverse changes in profitability and financial outlook in both the U.S. and/or foreign jurisdictions, or changes in our geographic footprint may require changes in the valuation allowances in order to reduce our deferred tax assets. Such changes could result in a material impact on earnings.Our annual cash needs could require us to repatriate cash to the U.S. from foreign jurisdictions, which may result in tax charges. We had no such tax charges in fiscal 2015. However, in fiscal 2014, we repatriated cash to the U.S. in connection with the sale of the Die Cut businesses, which resulted in a tax charge of $4.0 million in continuing operations and in fiscal 2013, we repatriated cash to the U.S. in connection with the acquisition of PDC, which resulted in a tax charge of $26.6 million.Substantially all of our voting stock is controlled by members of the Brady family, while our public investors hold non-voting stock. The interests of the voting and non-voting shareholders could differ, potentially resulting in decisions that unfavorably affect the value of the non-voting shares.Substantially all of our voting stock is controlled by Elizabeth P. Bruno, one of the Directors, and William H. Brady III, both of whom are descendants of the Company's founder.  All of our publicly traded shares are non-voting. Therefore, Ms. Bruno and Mr. Brady have control in most matters requiring approval or acquiescence by shareholders, including the composition of our Board of Directors and many corporate actions. Such concentration of ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a purchase offer that our public shareholders may find favorable, which in turn could adversely affect the market price of our common stock or prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium over our stock price.  Furthermore, this concentration of voting share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our non-voting common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies whose voting stock is controlled by a limited number of shareholders.11Table of ContentsFailure to meet certain financial covenants required by our debt agreements may adversely affect our assets, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity.As of July 31, 2015, we had $253.7 million in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, based on the availability under our credit facilities as of July 31, 2015, we had the ability to incur an additional $194.7 million under our revolving credit agreement. Our current revolving credit agreement and long-term debt obligations also impose certain restrictions on us. Refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (""MD&A"") within Item 7 for more information regarding our credit agreement and long-term debt obligations. If we breach any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then subject to applicable cure periods, the outstanding indebtedness (and any other indebtedness with cross-default provisions) could be declared immediately due and payable, which could adversely affect our assets, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity"
6,BRC,BRADY CORP,2014-09-29,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
Investors should carefully consider the risks set forth below and all other information contained in this report and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risk and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as market conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, wars or conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic or business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, including our results of operations, liquidity and financial conditions.Business RisksFailure to successfully implement our strategy in the Healthcare sector, or if successfully implemented, failure to realize the benefits expected from the strategy, may adversely affect our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.In December 2012, Brady acquired Precision Dynamics Corporation (“PDC”) to establish a base for our healthcare strategy.  In fiscal 2014, PDC represented 12.5% of our total sales from continuing operations. Sales declined approximately 2% at PDC in fiscal 2014 and the healthcare industry continues to be in a state of change with the uncertainty relating to government healthcare reforms. During fiscal 2014, we recorded impairment charges of $148.6 million, primarily related to the goodwill and other intangible assets in the PeopleID reporting unit, which consists primarily of the PDC business. The Company’s strategy to grow this business includes: key account focus offering customers a broad range of products to meet their complete identification needs, development and launch of proprietary new products, full continuum of care in the healthcare industry, and international sales penetration. There is a risk that the Company will not be able to return the business to growth and grow the business consistently, the strategy will fail, or the business will face increased levels of competition and pricing pressure. If these risks materialize, their effects could adversely impact our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity. Failure to successfully implement our Workplace Safety strategy, or if successfully implemented, failure to realize the benefits expected from the strategy, may adversely affect our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.In fiscal 2014, the Workplace Safety segment represented 32.6% of our total sales from continuing operations. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2012, the WPS segment experienced deterioration in sales and profits due to a reduction in direct catalog mailings, increased e-commerce competition, and pricing adjustments. While traditional direct marketing channels such as catalogs are important means of selling WPS products, an increasing number of customers are purchasing products on the Internet. The Company's strategy to grow this business includes: increased volume of catalog mailings, expanded e-commerce presence, further developed pricing capabilities, growing the customer base, and the expansion of products offered. The rate of sales decline in fiscal 2014 lessened each quarter and the segment returned to positive organic growth of 0.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 as the strategy began to take hold. There is a risk that the Company will not continue to successfully implement this strategy, or if successfully implemented, not realize its expected benefits, due to the continued levels of increased competition and pricing pressure brought about by the Internet.  There is also a risk that the Company may not be able to permanently reverse the downward trends in this business and return the segment to historic levels of sales and profits.  If these risks materialize, their effects could adversely impact our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.  Failure to compete effectively or remain competitive may have a negative impact on our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.We actively compete with companies that produce and market the same or similar products, and in some instances, with companies that sell different products that are designed for the same end user. Additionally, we continue to face competition through the Internet in our entire business. Competition may force us to reduce prices or incur additional costs to remain competitive. We compete on the basis of price, customer support, product innovation, product offering, product quality, expertise, production capabilities, and for multinational customers, our global footprint. Present or future competitors may develop and introduce new and enhanced products, offer products based on alternative technologies and processes, accept lower profit,  have greater financial, technical or other resources, or lower production costs or other pricing advantages. Any of these could put us at a disadvantage by threatening our share of sales or reducing our profit margins, which could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flow and liquidity. Additionally, throughout our global business, distributors and customers may seek lower cost sourcing opportunities, which could result in a loss of business that may adversely impact our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.  Failure to successfully complete our facility consolidation plans may adversely impact our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.We continue to implement measures to reduce our cost structure, simplify our business structure, and standardize our processes. In fiscal 2013, we incurred approximately $26 million in restructuring costs associated with the reorganization of the 7Table of ContentsCompany along global product lines, which included the standardization of business systems and a restructuring of the global workforce.  At the end of fiscal 2013 and into fiscal 2014, our focus turned to the consolidation of facilities, which resulted in approximately $15 million of restructuring expense in fiscal 2014. Facility consolidation activities will extend into fiscal 2015 as we slowed certain consolidation activities to ensure the highest levels of quality and delivery throughout the transition. Successfully completing the facilities consolidations is critical to our future competitiveness and to improve profitability. Facility consolidations will result in a higher concentration of operations in certain locations. Risks related to facility consolidations include poor execution impacting customer service, customer acceptance of these changes, inability to implement standard processes and systems, resource allocation among competing priorities, employee disruption and turnover, inability to manufacture and supply products in the event of a material casualty event at one of our principal facilities, and additional or higher than anticipated charges related to these actions. These actions to reduce our cost structure and the charges related to these actions could have a material adverse impact on our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.Deterioration of or instability in the global economy and financial markets may adversely affect our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.  Our business and operating results could be affected by global economic conditions. In fiscal 2013, our business was negatively impacted by the weak economy in Europe, Australia and Brazil. In fiscal 2014, Brazil continued to weaken. When global economic conditions deteriorate or economic uncertainty continues, customers and potential customers may experience deterioration of their businesses, which may result in the delay or cancellation of plans to purchase our products. Our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuations in the businesses of our customers or potential customers could have a material adverse impact on our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.Our failure or the failure of third-party service providers to protect our sites, networks and systems against security breaches, or otherwise to protect our confidential information, may substantially harm our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.   Our business systems collect, maintain, transmit and store data about our customers, vendors and others, including credit card information and personally identifiable information, as well as other confidential and proprietary information. We also employ third-party service providers that store, process and transmit proprietary, personal and confidential information on our behalf. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties in an effort to securely transmit confidential and sensitive information, including credit card numbers. Our security measures, and those of our third-party service providers, may not detect or prevent all attempts to hack our systems, denial-of-service attacks, viruses, malicious software, break-ins, phishing attacks, social engineering, security breaches or other attacks and similar disruptions that may jeopardize the security of information stored in or transmitted by our sites, networks and systems or that we or our third-party service providers otherwise maintain. We and our service providers may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent all types of attacks, and techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and may not be known until launched against us or our third-party service providers. In addition, security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships.  Although we maintain privacy, data breach and network security liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all.  Any compromise or breach of our security measures, or those of our third-party service providers, could adversely impact our ability to conduct business, violate applicable privacy, data security and other laws, and cause significant legal and financial exposure, adverse publicity, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse and material effect on our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.The global nature of our business exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations that could adversely affect sales, results of operations, cash flow, and liquidity.Approximately 50% of our sales are derived outside the United States. Sales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S. dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, and may adversely affect our financial statements. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in currencies other than U.S. dollars into other countries. Decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials, products, and services purchased overseas. Our sales and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, and the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries may invoice customers in a currency other than its functional currency, which could result in unfavorable translation effects on sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.8Table of ContentsFailure to develop new products or gain acceptance of new products could adversely impact our sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.Development of proprietary products is a driver of core growth and reasonable gross profit margins both currently and in the future, particularly within our ID Solutions segment. Therefore, we must continue to develop new and innovative products, as well as acquire and retain the necessary intellectual property rights in these products. We continue to invest in the development and marketing of new products. These expenditures do not always result in products that will be accepted by our customers.  Failure to develop successful new products may also cause customers to buy from a competitor or may cause us to lower our prices in order to compete. If we fail to make innovations, if we launch products with quality problems, or if customers do not accept our new products, then our sales, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity could be adversely affected.Inability to identify, complete, and integrate acquisitions and grow acquired companies, may adversely impact our sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.Our historical growth has included acquisitions, and our future growth strategy may include acquisition opportunities. For example, in fiscal 2013 the Company acquired PDC, a manufacturer of identification products primarily for the healthcare sector, for $301.2 million. We have not met the sales growth synergies identified at the time of the PDC acquisition, which, in addition to other factors, resulted in the Company recording impairment charges of $148.6 million during fiscal 2014, primarily related to the goodwill and other intangible assets in the PeopleID reporting unit, which consists primarily of the PDC business. Failure to achieve these synergies for PDC or other acquired companies may adversely impact our sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity. We may not focus on acquisitions as part of our growth strategy, or if we do, we may not be able to identify acquisition targets or successfully complete acquisitions in the future due to the absence of quality companies in our target markets, economic conditions, or price expectations from sellers. If we do not complete additional acquisitions, our growth may be limited.Acquisitions place significant demands on management, operational, and financial resources. Recent and future acquisitions will require integration of operations, sales and marketing, information technology, finance, and administrative operations, which could decrease the time available to focus on our other growth strategies. We cannot assure that we will be able to successfully integrate acquisitions, that these acquisitions will operate profitably, or that we will be able to achieve the desired sales growth or operational success. Our sales, results of operations, cash flow, and liquidity could be adversely affected if we do not successfully integrate the newly acquired businesses, or if our other businesses suffer due to the increased focus on the acquired businesses. Demand for our products may be adversely affected by numerous factors, some of which we cannot predict or control. This could adversely affect our sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.Numerous factors may affect the demand for our products, including:•Future financial performance of major markets served•Consolidation in the marketplace, allowing competitors and customers to be more efficient and more price competitive•Future competitors entering the marketplace•Decreasing product life cycles                                                                 •Changes in customer preferencesIf any of these factors occur, the demand for our products could suffer, and this could adversely impact our sales, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.A large customer loss could significantly affect sales, results of operations, cash flow, and liquidity.While we have a broad customer base and no individual customer represents 5% or more of total sales, we conduct business with several large customers and distribution companies. Our dependence on these customers makes relationships with them important. We cannot guarantee that these relationships will be retained in the future. Because these large customers account for a significant portion of sales, they may possess a greater capacity to negotiate reduced prices. If we are unable to provide products to our customers at the quality and prices acceptable to them, some of our customers may shift their business to competitors or may substitute another manufacturer's products. If one of the large customers consolidates, is acquired, or loses market share, the result of that event may have an adverse impact on our business. The loss of or reduction of business from one or more of these large customers could have a material adverse impact on our sales, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity.We depend on key employees and the loss of these individuals could have an adverse effect on our operations.Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our key executives, managers and other skilled employees. Over the past two fiscal years, we have experienced the loss of several key executives. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain our key executives, managers and employees. The departure of our key personnel without adequate replacement could disrupt our business operations. Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical and industry 9Table of Contentsexperience to operate our business successfully. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our costs to do so increase significantly, our operations could be materially adversely affected.  Divestitures could negatively impact our business and contingent liabilities from divested businesses could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.  We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that we determine do not align with our strategic plan, or that are not achieving the desired return on investment.  For example, over the last three fiscal years, we have divested our Etimark, Brady Medical, and Varitronics businesses, and our Asia Die-Cut and Balkhausen Die-Cut businesses. Divestitures pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business. For example, when we decide to sell a business or assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms and within our anticipated time-frame, and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell a business, the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions which may not be satisfied. In addition, the impact of the divestiture on our revenue and net earnings may be larger than projected, which could distract management, and disputes may arise with buyers. Also, we have retained responsibility for and have agreed to indemnify buyers against some contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses that we have recently sold. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flow and liquidity, but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue.We are a global company headquartered in the United States.   We are subject to extensive regulations by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and self-regulatory entities at various levels of the governing bodies. Failure to comply with laws and regulations could adversely affect our sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.Our operations are subject to the risks of doing business domestically and globally, including the following:•Delays or disruptions in product deliveries and payments in connection with international manufacturing and sales•Political and economic instability and disruptions•Imposition of duties and tariffs•Import, export and economic sanction laws•Current and changing governmental policies,  regulatory, and business environments •Disadvantages from competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act •Local labor market conditions•Regulations relating to climate change, air emissions, wastewater discharges, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes•Regulations relating to health, safety and the protection of the environment•Specific country regulations where our products are manufactured or sold•Laws and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government, including audit requirements of government contracts related to procurement integrity, export control, employment practices, and the accuracy of records and recording of costsFurther, these laws and regulations are constantly evolving and it is impossible to accurately predict the effect they may have upon our sales, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims rules, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. Any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits, could damage our reputation, and could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flow and liquidity. Product liability claims could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and reputation.Our business exposes us to potential product liability risk, as well as warranty and recall claims that are inherent in the design, manufacture, sale and use of our products. We sell products in industries such as aerospace, defense, healthcare, chemical, and energy where the impact of product liability risk is high. To date, we have not incurred material costs related to these types of claims. However, in the event our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected and we are subject to such claims above the amount of insurance coverage, outside the scope of our coverage, or for which we do not have coverage, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as our reputation, could be materially and adversely affected. 10Table of ContentsFinancial/Ownership RisksFailure to execute our strategies could result in impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, which may negatively impact earnings and profitability.  We have goodwill of $515.0 million and other intangible assets of $91.0 million as of July 31, 2014, which represents 48.3% of our total assets. During fiscal 2014, we recorded impairment charges of $148.6 million, primarily related to the goodwill and other intangible assets in the PeopleID reporting unit. During fiscal 2013, we recorded impairment charges of $204.4 million primarily related to goodwill in the WPS Americas and IDS APAC reporting units. We evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present, based upon the fair value of each reporting unit. We assess the impairment of other intangible assets on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present, based upon the expected future cash flows of the respective assets. These valuations include management's estimates of sales, profitability, cash flow generation, capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditures, and other assumptions. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to achieve sales projections or cost savings, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets or in entity structure, and divestitures may adversely impact the assumptions used in the valuations. If the estimated fair value of our reporting units changes in future periods, we may be required to record an impairment charge related to goodwill or other intangible assets, which would reduce earnings and profit in such period.Changes in tax legislation or tax rates could adversely affect results of operations and financial statements. Additionally, audits by taxing authorities could result in tax payments for prior periods.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many non-U.S. jurisdictions. As such, our earnings are subject to risk due to changing tax laws and tax rates around the world. At any point in time, there are a number of tax proposals at various stages of legislation throughout the globe.

As part of this review, we utilize historical results, projected future operating results, eligible carry-forward periods, tax planning opportunities, and other relevant considerations. Adverse changes in profitability and financial outlook in both the U.S. and/or foreign jurisdictions, or changes in our geographic footprint may require changes in the valuation allowances in order to reduce our deferred tax assets. Such changes could result in a material impact on earnings.Our annual cash needs could require us to repatriate cash to the U.S. from foreign jurisdictions, which may result in tax charges. For example, in fiscal 2014, we repatriated cash to the U.S. in connection with the sale of the Die Cut businesses, which resulted in a tax charge of $4.0 million in continuing operations. In fiscal 2013, we repatriated cash to the U.S. in connection with the acquisition of PDC, which resulted in a tax charge of $26.6 million.Substantially all of our voting stock is controlled by members of the Brady family, while our public investors hold non-voting stock. The interests of the voting and non-voting shareholders could differ, potentially resulting in decisions that unfavorably affect the value of the non-voting shares.Substantially all of our voting stock is controlled by Elizabeth P.

Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, including our results of operations, liquidity and financial conditions.6Table of ContentsBusiness RisksFailure to successfully implement our Workplace Safety strategy, or if successfully implemented, failure to realize the benefits expected from the strategy, may adversely affect our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.In fiscal 2013, the Workplace Safety platform represented 36.3% of our total sales from continuing operations. Throughout the last two fiscal years, this platform has experienced deterioration in sales and profits due to increased competition and pricing pressure. An increasing number of customers are purchasing products on the Internet instead of through traditional direct marketing channels such as catalogs. The Company's strategy to grow this business includes: investing to improve e-commerce capabilities, pricing structure changes, and the expansion of products offered. There is a risk that the Company will not successfully implement this strategy, or if successfully implemented, not realize its expected benefits, due to the continued levels of increased competition and pricing pressure brought about by the Internet.  There is also a risk that the Company may not be able to reverse the downward trends in this business and return the segment to historic levels of sales and profits.  If these risks materialize, their effects could adversely impact our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.  Deterioration of or instability in the global economy and financial markets may adversely affect our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by global economic conditions. In fiscal 2013, sales were negatively impacted by the recession in Europe and Australia. When global economic conditions deteriorate or economic uncertainty continues, customers and potential customers may experience deterioration of their businesses, which may result in the delay or cancellation of plans to purchase our products. Our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuations in the businesses of our customers or potential customers could have a material adverse impact on our sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.Demand for our products may be adversely affected by numerous factors, some of which we cannot predict or control.

Competition may force us to reduce prices or incur additional costs to remain competitive. We compete on the basis of price, customer support, product innovation, product offering, product quality, production capabilities, and for multinational customers, our global footprint. Present or future competitors may accept lower profit, have greater financial, technical or other resources, lower production costs or other pricing advantages, any of which could put us at a disadvantage by threatening our share of sales or reducing our profit margins, which would adversely impact our results of operations, cash flow and liquidity. Additionally, throughout our global business, distributors and customers may seek lower cost sourcing opportunities, which could result in a loss of business that may adversely impact sales, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity.7Table of ContentsA large customer loss could significantly affect sales, results of operations, cash flow, and liquidity.While we have a broad customer base and no individual customer represents 5% or more of total sales, we conduct business with several large customers and distribution companies. Our dependence on these customers makes relationships with them important. We cannot guarantee that these relationships will be retained in the future. Because these large customers account for a significant portion of sales, they may possess a greater capacity to negotiate reduced prices. If we are unable to provide products to our customers at the quality and prices acceptable to them, some of our customers may shift their business to competitors or may substitute another manufacturer's products. If one of the large customers consolidates, is acquired, or loses market share, the result of that event may have an adverse impact on our business. The loss of or reduction of business from one or more of these large customers could have a material adverse impact on our sales, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity.Divestitures could negatively impact our business and contingent liabilities from divested businesses could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that we determine do not align with our strategic plan, or that are not achieving the desired return on investment.  For example, over the last three fiscal years, we have divested our Teklynx, Etimark, Brady Medical, and Varitronics businesses, and have announced plans to divest our Asia Die-Cut and Balkhausen businesses.  Divestitures pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business. For example, when we decide to sell a business or assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms and within our anticipated time-frame, and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions which may not be satisfied. In addition, the impact of the divestiture on our revenue and net earnings may be larger than projected, which could distract management, and disputes may arise with buyers. In addition, we have retained responsibility for and have agreed to indemnify buyers against some contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses that we have recently sold. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flow and liquidity, but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue.Inability to identify, complete and integrate acquisitions may adversely impact our sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.Our historical growth has included acquisitions, and our future growth strategy includes acquisition opportunities. For example, in fiscal 2013 the Company acquired Precision Dynamics Corporation (""PDC""), a manufacturer of identification products primarily for the healthcare sector, for $301.2 million. We may not be able to identify acquisition targets or  successfully complete acquisitions in the future due to the absence of quality companies in our target markets, economic conditions, or price expectations from sellers. If we are unable to complete additional acquisitions, our growth may be limited.Additionally, as we grow through acquisitions, we will continue to place significant demands on management, operational, and financial resources. Recent and future acquisitions will require integration of operations, sales and marketing, information technology, finance and administrative operations, which could decrease the time available to serve and attract customers. We cannot assure that we will be able to successfully integrate acquisitions, that these acquisitions will operate profitably, or that we will be able to achieve the desired financial or operational success. Our financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not successfully integrate the newly acquired businesses, or if our other businesses suffer due to the increased focus on the newly acquired businesses.Failure to successfully complete restructuring plans may adversely impact our sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.We continue to implement measures to reduce our cost structure, simplify our business structure and standardize our processes. Successful implementation of such initiatives is critical to our future competitiveness and to improve profitability. These actions include reorganization of the Company along global product lines, a restructuring of the global workforce, consolidation of facilities, reorganization and restructuring of resources and standardization of business systems, which impact all functions of the Company. Facility consolidations will result in a higher concentration of operations in certain locations. Risks include customer acceptance of these changes, inability to implement standard processes and systems, resource allocation among competing priorities, employee disruption and turnover, inability to manufacture and supply products in the event of a material casualty event at one of our principal facilities and additional charges related to these actions. These actions to reduce our cost structure and the charges related to these actions could have a material adverse impact on our sales, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.8Table of ContentsThe global nature of our business exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations that could adversely affect sales, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity and profits.Approximately 50% of our sales are derived outside the United States. Sales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S. dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, and may adversely affect our financial statements. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in currencies other than U.S. dollars into other countries. Decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials, products, and services purchased overseas. Our sales and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, and the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries may invoice customers in a currency other than its functional currency, which could result in unfavorable translation effects on sales, profits, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.We depend on key employees and the loss of these individuals could have an adverse affect on our operations. Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our key executives, managers and other skilled employees. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain our key officers, managers and employees. The departure of our key personnel without adequate replacement could disrupt our business operations. Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical and industry experience to operate our business successfully. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our costs to do so increase significantly, our operations could be materially adversely affected.International operations are subject to various U.S. or country-specific regulations which could adversely affect our sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.Our operations are subject to the risks of doing business abroad, including the following:•Delays or disruptions in product deliveries and payments in connection with international manufacturing and sales•Political and economic instability and disruptions•Imposition of duties and tariffs•Import and export controls•Changes in governmental policies and business environments•Disadvantages from competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)•Local labor market conditions•Current and changing regulatory environments•Potentially adverse tax consequences, including repatriation of earnings•Stability of the Euro and its ability to serve as a single currency for a variety of countriesThese events could have an adverse effect on our operations by reducing the demand, decreasing prices, or increasing costs for our products, which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.Failure to develop new products or gain acceptance of new products could adversely impact our sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.Development of proprietary products is a driver of core growth and reasonable gross profit margins both currently and in the future, particularly within our ID Solutions segment.  Therefore, we must continue to develop new and innovative products, as well as acquire and retain the necessary intellectual property rights in these products. If we fail to make innovations, if we launch products with quality problems, or if customers do not accept our new products, then our sales, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity could be adversely affected. We continue to invest in the development and marketing of new products. These expenditures do not always result in products that will be accepted by our customers. Failure to develop successful new products may also cause customers to buy from a competitor or may cause us to lower our prices in order to compete. This could have an adverse impact on sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity. Failure to comply with laws and regulations could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and reputation.We are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and self-regulatory entities at the federal, state and local levels, including the following:•Regulations relating to climate change, air emissions, wastewater discharges, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes•Regulations relating to health, safety and the protection of the environment•Specific country regulations where our products are manufactured or sold•Import, export and economic sanction laws9Table of Contents•Laws and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government, audit for compliance with requirements of government contracts including procurement integrity, export control, employment practices, and the accuracy of records and recording of costsFurther, these laws and regulations are constantly evolving, and it is impossible to accurately predict the effect they may have upon our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims rules, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. Any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits, and could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flow and liquidity and damage our reputation.Computer systems and technology may be susceptible to cyber threats which could adversely impact results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.Our exposure to cyber-security threats is growing as we expand and increase our reliance on computers and e-commerce technologies. Our business employs systems and websites designed for the secure storage and transmission of proprietary information. Security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation and potential liability. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber attacks. Any compromise of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business.Product liability claims could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and reputation.Our business exposes us to potential product liability risk, as well as warranty and recall claims that are inherent in the design, manufacture, sale and use of our products, including our healthcare products. We have not to date incurred material costs related to these claims. However, in the event our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected and we are subject to such claims above the amount of insurance coverage, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as our reputation, could be materially and adversely affected.Financial/Ownership RisksFailure to execute our strategies could result in impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets , which may negatively impact profitability.We have goodwill of $617.2 million and other intangible assets of $156.9 million as of July 31, 2013, which represents 54% of our total assets.  During fiscal 2013, we recorded impairment charges of $204.4 million primarily related to goodwill in the WPS Americas and IDS APAC reporting units.  In fiscal 2012, we recorded impairment charges of $115.7 million related to the former North/South Asia reporting unit, which is now included in discontinued operations. We evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators are present based upon the fair value of each reporting unit. We assess the impairment of other intangible assets on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present, based upon the expected future cash flows of the respective assets. These valuations include management's estimates of sales, profitability, cash flow generation, capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditures, and other assumptions. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to achieve sales projections or cost savings, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets or in entity structure, and divestitures may adversely impact the assumptions used in the valuations. If the estimated fair value of our reporting units changes in future periods, we may be required to record an impairment charge related to goodwill or other intangible assets, which would reduce earnings in such period.Changes in tax legislation or tax rates could adversely affect results of operations and financial statements. Additionally, audits by taxing authorities could result in tax payments for prior periods.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many non-U.S. jurisdictions. As such, our earnings are subject to risk due to changing tax laws and tax rates around the world. At any point in time, there are a number of tax proposals at various stages of legislation throughout the globe. While it is impossible for us to predict whether some or all of these proposals will be enacted, it likely would have an impact on our earnings.Our tax filings are subject to audit by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. If these audits result in payments or assessments that differ from our reserves, our future net earnings may be adversely impacted.10Table of ContentsWe review the probability of the realization of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis based on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. As part of this review, we utilize historical results, projected future operating results, eligible carry-forward periods, tax planning opportunities, and other relevant considerations. Adverse changes in profitability and financial outlook in both the U.S. and/or foreign jurisdictions, or changes in our geographic footprint may require changes in the valuation allowances in order to reduce our deferred tax assets. Such changes could result in a material impact on earnings.  Our annual cash needs could require us to repatriate cash to the U.S. from foreign jurisdictions.  For example, in fiscal 2013 we repatriated cash to the U.S.  in connection with the acquisition of PDC, which resulted in a tax charge of $26.6 million.  Substantially all of our voting stock is controlled by members of the Brady family, while our public investors hold non-voting stock. The interests of the voting and non-voting shareholders could differ, potentially resulting in decisions that unfavorably affect the value of the non-voting shares. Substantially all of our voting stock is controlled by Elizabeth P. Pungello, one of the Directors, and William H. Brady III, both of whom are descendants of the Company's founder.  All of our publicly traded shares are non-voting.  Therefore, Ms. Pungello and Mr. Brady have control in most matters requiring approval or acquiescence by shareholders, including the composition of our Board of Directors and many corporate actions.  Such concentration of ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a purchase offer that our public shareholders may find favorable, which in turn could adversely affect the market price of our common stock or prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium over our stock price.  Furthermore, this concentration of voting share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our non-voting common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies whose voting stock is controlled by a limited number of shareholders.Failure to meet certain financial covenants required by our debt agreements may adversely affect our assets, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity.As of July 31, 2013, we had $313 million in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, based on the availability under our credit facilities as of July 31, 2013, we had the ability to incur an additional $411 million under our revolving credit agreement. Our current revolving credit agreement and long-term debt obligations also impose certain restrictions on us. Refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (""MD&A"") within Item 7 for more information regarding our credit agreement and long-term debt obligations. If we breach any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then subject to applicable cure periods, the outstanding indebtedness (and any other indebtedness with cross-default provisions) could be declared immediately due and payable, which would adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition"
16,BRC,BRADY CORP,2012-09-27,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
  Investors should carefully consider the risks set forth below and all other information contained in this report andother documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risk and uncertaintiesthat affect many other companies, such as market conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, wars or conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions ofexpected economic or business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, including our results of operations, liquidity and financial conditions. Deterioration of or instability in the global economy and financial markets may adversely affectour business and financial statements.  Our business and operating results have been and will continueto be affected by global economic conditions. When global economic conditions deteriorate or economic uncertainty continues, customers and potential customers may experience deterioration of their businesses, which may result in the delay orcancellation of plans to purchase our products. In particular, the European debt crisis and the instability and uncertainty relating to the Euro could adversely impact our financial results. Our sensitivity to economic cycles and any relatedfluctuations in the businesses of our customers or potential customers may have a material effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial conditions.   6 Table of ContentsE-commerce increases price transparency and may adversely affect ourbusiness and financial statements.  A portion of our Direct Marketing business platform istransitioning from traditional channels to e-commerce. Historically, competitors were experts in direct marketing database management. The competitive landscape is changing with the evolution of e-commerce. The barriers to entry are changing withinternet technology replacing some traditional catalog direct marketing expertise, and a consequence of this shift is such that prices on some commodity products can be easily compared by the customer. Approximately one-fourth of our sales arederived from our Direct Marketing platform, and this shift toward increased price transparency could adversely impact our results of operations.  Demand for our products may be adversely affected by numerous factors, some of which we cannot predict or control. This could adversely affect our financial results. Numerous factors may affect the demand for our products including:      Cyclical demands of the end user marketplace. These markets include, but are not limited to, mobile telecommunication devices, hard diskdrives, and electronics in personal computers and other electronic devices.       Future financial performance of major markets served      Consolidation in the marketplace, allowing competitors and customers to be more efficient and more price competitive      Future competitors entering the marketplace       Large customer market share fluctuations       Ever decreasing product life cycles       Changes in customer preferences       Declines in general economic conditions  If any of these factors occur, the demand for our products could suffer, and this would adversely affect our results of operations. Price reductions or additional costs may need to be incurred to remain competitive in certain markets, which wouldhave a negative impact on profitability.  We face substantial competition throughout our entirebusiness, but particularly in the Die-Cut business platform. Competition may force us to cut prices or incur additional costs to remain competitive. We compete on the basis of price, production capabilities, engineering, global footprint, and globalaccount management. Present or future competitors may have greater financial, technical or other resources, lower production costs or other pricing advantages, any of which could put us at a disadvantage in the affected business by threatening ourmarket share or reducing our profit margins. Additionally, throughout our global business, distributors and customers may seek lower cost sourcing opportunities, which could result in a loss of business that may adversely impact results ofoperations, cash flows, and liquidity.  A large customer loss could significantly affect results ofoperations, cash flows, and liquidity.  While we have a broad customer base and no individual customerrepresents 5% or more of total sales, several of our large customers in the Die-Cut platform together comprise a significant portion of our sales. Additionally, we conduct business with several large distribution companies. Our dependence on theselarge customers makes relationships with them important. We cannot guarantee that these relationships will be retained in the future. Because these large customers account for a significant portion of sales, they may possess a greater capacity tonegotiate reduced prices. If we are unable to provide products to our customers at the quality and prices acceptable to them or to adapt to technological changes, some of our customers may shift their business to competitors or may substituteanother manufacturers products. If one of the large customers consolidates, is acquired, or loses market share, the result of that event may have an adverse impact on our business. The loss of or reduction of business from one or more of theselarge customers could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity.  The global nature of our business exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations that could adversely affect sales, profits, and cash balances. The majority of our sales are derived outside the United States. Sales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S.dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, and may adversely affect our financial statements. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in currencies otherthan U.S. dollars into other countries. Decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials, products, and services purchased overseas. Our sales and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes,and the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries may invoice customers in a currency other than its functional currency, which could result in unfavorabletranslation effects on sales, profits, and cash balances.   7 Table of ContentsInternational operations are subject to various U.S. orcountry-specific regulations which could adversely affect our financial statements.

We continue to invest in thedevelopment and marketing of new products. These expenditures do not always result in products that will be accepted by the market. Failure to develop successful new products may also cause customers to buy from a competitor or may cause us to lowerour prices in order to compete. This could have an adverse impact on profitability.  Inability toidentify, complete and integrate acquisitions may adversely impact our business and financial statements.  Our historical growth has included, and our future growth strategy includes making acquisitions. We may not be able to identify acquisition targets or successfully complete acquisitions in the future dueto the absence of quality companies in our target markets, economic conditions, or price expectations from sellers. If we are unable to complete additional acquisitions, our growth may be limited. Additionally, as we grow through acquisitions, we will continue to place significant demands on management, operational,and financial resources. Recent and future acquisitions will require integration of operations, sales and marketing, information technology, finance and administrative operations, which could decrease the time available to serve and attractcustomers. We cannot assure that we will be able to successfully integrate acquisitions, that these acquisitions will operate profitably, or that we will be able to achieve the financial or operational success expected from the acquisitions. Ourfinancial condition, cash flows, and operational results could be adversely affected if we do not successfully integrate the newly acquired businesses, or if our other businesses suffer due to the increased focus on the newly acquired businesses.  8 Table of ContentsFailure to successfully complete restructuring plans may adverselyimpact the financial statements.  We continue to implement measures to address our cost structure.Successful implementation of such initiatives is critical to our future competitiveness and to improve profitability. Further actions to reduce our cost structure and the charges related to these actions may have a material effect on our results ofoperations and financial condition.  Failure to comply with laws and regulations could adversely affectour financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and reputation.  We are subject toextensive regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and self-regulatory entities at the federal, state and local levels, including the following:       Regulations relating to climate change, air emissions, wastewater discharges, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes      Regulations relating to health, safety and the protection of the environment      Specific country regulations where product is manufactured or sold      Import, export and economic sanction laws       Laws and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government, audit for compliance with requirements of government contractsincluding procurement integrity, export control, employment practices, and the accuracy of records and recording of costs  Further, these laws and regulations are constantly evolving, and it is impossible to predict accurately the effect they may have upon our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us fromacts committed by employees, agents or business partners that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims rules, competition, export andimport compliance, money laundering and data privacy. Any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetarypenalties and related shareholder lawsuits, and could damage our reputation.  Computer systems andtechnology may be susceptible to cyber threats which could adversely impact the financial statements. Our exposure to cyber-security threats is growing as we expand and increase our reliance on computers and digitaltechnologies. Our business employs systems and websites designed for the secure storage and transmission of proprietary information. Security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation and potentialliability.

Any compromise of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legaland financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business.  Failure to meet certain financial covenants required by our debt agreements may adversely affect our assets, financial position, cash flows, and liquidity. As of July 31, 2012, we had approximately $316.2 million in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, based on theavailability under our credit facilities as of July 31, 2012, we had the ability to incur an additional $300.0 million under our revolving credit agreement. Our current revolving credit agreement and long-term debt obligations also imposecertain restrictions on us. Refer to the MD&A within Item 7 for more information regarding our credit agreement and long-term debt obligations. If we breach any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders,then, subject to applicable cure periods, the outstanding indebtedness (and any other indebtedness with cross-default provisions) could be declared immediately due and payable, which would adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.  9 Table of ContentsAn increase in the level of debt could adversely affect our financialhealth.  An increase in our level of debt, which historically has occurred in order to financeacquisitions and for other general corporate purposes, could adversely impact: obligations under existing debt agreements; ability to obtain additional financing for future growth; future interest rates; cash flows available to fund new productdevelopment; capital expenditures; working capital and other general corporate activities; and our flexibility in planning and reacting to changes in the business. Goodwill or other intangible assets may become impaired, which may negatively impact profitability. We have goodwill of $676.8 million and other intangible assets of $84.1 million as of July 31,2012, which represents 47% of our total assets. We evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators are present based upon the fair value of each reporting unit. We assess the impairment of otherintangible assets on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators are present based upon the expected future cash flows of the respective assets. These valuations include managements estimates of sales, profitability, cash flowgeneration, capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditures, and other assumptions. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to achieve forecasted sales projections or costsavings, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets or in entity structure, and divestitures may adversely impact the assumptions used in the valuations. If theestimated fair value of our reporting units changes in future periods, we may be required to record an impairment charge related to goodwill or other intangible assets, which would reduce earnings in such period.

10,BRC,BRADY CORP,2011-09-27,">Item 1A.     Risk Factors
Before making an investment decision with respect to the Companys stock, you should carefullyconsider the risks set forth below and all other information contained in this report. If any ofthe events contemplated by the following risks actually occur, then the Companys business,financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, or liquidity could be materially affected.The Companys financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or liquidity may beadversely affected by a prolonged economic downturn or economic uncertainty.The Companys business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected byglobal economic conditions. As global economic conditions deteriorate or economic uncertaintycontinues, our customers and potential customers may experience deterioration of their businesses,which may result in the delay or cancellation of plans to purchase our products. Our sensitivity toeconomic cycles and any related fluctuations in the businesses of our customers or potentialcustomers may have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows,or liquidity.Demand for the Companys products may be susceptible to fluctuations in the major marketsserved that may cause volatility in its results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity.Sales of the Companys products may be susceptible to changes in market conditions. TheCompanys business in the safety and facility identification and wire and cable identificationproduct lines tends to vary with the nominal GDP of the local economies in which the Companymanufactures and sells. As a result, in periods of economic contraction, the business is likely todecline. In the precision die-cut and high performance identification product lines, the Companymay be adversely affected by reduced demand for products due to downturns in the global economy asthis is a more volatile business. This can result in higher degrees of volatility in the Companysnet sales, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity. These more volatile markets include,but are not limited to, mobile telecommunication devices, hard disk drives and electronics inpersonal computers and other electronic devices. 10Table of ContentsFailure to meet certain financial covenants required by our debt agreements may adverselyaffect our assets, financial position, cash flows, and liquidity.The Companys debt and revolving loan agreements require it to maintain certain financialcovenants. The June 2004, February 2006, March 2007 and May 2010 debt agreements require theCompany to maintain a ratio of debt to the trailing twelve months earnings before interest, taxes,depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), as defined in the debt agreements, of not more than a 3.5to 1.0 ratio (leverage ratio). The October 2006 revolving loan agreement, as amended and extendedin May 2008, requires the Company to maintain a ratio of debt to trailing twelve months EBITDA, asdefined by the debt agreement, of not more than a 3.0 to 1.0 ratio. Additionally, the revolvingloan agreement requires the trailing twelve months earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) tointerest expense of not less than a 3.0 to 1.0 ratio (interest expense coverage). The October 2006revolving loan agreement, as amended and extended in May 2008, also requires that the aggregate netbook value of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of by the Company and its subsidiaries, asdefined in the agreement, in any fiscal year of the Company shall not exceed 15% of consolidatedtangible net worth.If we breach any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from thelenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, the outstanding indebtedness (and any otherindebtedness with cross-default provisions) could be declared immediately due and payable, whichwould adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.  An increase in the Companys level of debt could adversely affect our financial health.An increase in the Companys level of debt, which historically has occurred to financeacquisitions and for other general corporate purposes, could adversely impact: obligations underexisting debt agreements; ability to obtain additional financing for future growth; future interestrates; cash flows available to fund new product development; capital expenditures; working capitaland other general corporate activities; and the Companys flexibility in planning and reacting tochanges in the business.The Companys net earnings could be affected by changes in tax legislation or tax rates.Additionally, audits by taxing authorities could result in tax payments for prior periods.The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many non-U.S. jurisdictions. Assuch the Companys net earnings are subject to risk due to changing tax laws and tax rates aroundthe world. At any point in time, there are a number of tax proposals at various stages oflegislation throughout the globe. While it is impossible for us to predict whether some or all ofthese proposals will be enacted, it is likely they will have an impact on our net earnings.The Companys tax filings are subject to audit by U.S. federal, state and local taxauthorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. If these audits result in payments or assessmentsdifferent from our reserves, our future net earnings may be adversely impacted.The Company reviews the probability of the realization of its deferred tax assets on aquarterly basis based on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Aspart of this review, the Company utilizes historical results, projected future operating results,eligible carry-forward periods, tax planning opportunities, and other relevant considerations.Adverse changes in profitability and financial outlook in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions,or changes in its geographic footprint may require changes in the valuation allowances to reduceits deferred tax assets. Such changes could result in material non-cash expenses in the period inwhich the changes are made and could have a material impact on the Companys net earnings.The Company may be adversely impacted by an inability to identify, complete and integrateacquisitions.Our historical growth has included, and our future growth strategy includes, acquisitions. TheCompany may not be able to identify acquisition targets or successfully complete acquisitions inthe future due to the absence of quality companies, economic conditions, or price expectations fromsellers. If the Company is unable to complete additional acquisitions, its growth may be limited. 11Table of ContentsAdditionally, as the Company grows through acquisitions, it will continue to place significantdemands on its management, operational and financial resources. Recent and future acquisitions willrequire integration of operations, sales and marketing, information technology, finance andadministrative operations. The successful integration of acquisitions will require substantialattention from the Companys management and the management of the acquired businesses, which coulddecrease the time management, has to serve and attract customers. The Company cannot assure that itwill be able to successfully integrate these recent or any future acquisitions, that theseacquisitions will operate profitably or that it will be able to achieve the financial oroperational success expected from the acquisitions. The Companys financial condition, cash flowsand operational results could be adversely affected if it does not successfully integrate the newlyacquired businesses or if its other businesses suffer on account of the increased focus on thenewly acquired businesses.If the Company fails to develop new products or its customers do not accept the new productsit develops, the Companys business could be adversely affected.Development of proprietary products is key to the success of the Companys core growth andreasonable gross profit margins now and in the future. Therefore, the Company must continue todevelop new and innovative products and acquire and retain the necessary intellectual propertyrights in these products on an ongoing basis. If it fails to make innovations, launches productswith quality problems, or the market does not accept its new products, then the Companys financialcondition, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity could be adversely affected. TheCompany continues to invest in the development and marketing of new products. These expenditures donot always result in products that will be accepted by the market. Failure to develop successfulnew products may also cause its customers to buy from a competitor or may cause the Company tolower its prices in order to compete. This could have an adverse impact on the Companysprofitability.The Company operates in competitive markets and may be forced to cut its prices or incuradditional costs to remain competitive, which may have a negative impact on its profitability.The Company faces substantial competition throughout its entire business, but particularly inthe precision die-cut business. Competition may force the Company to cut its prices or incuradditional costs to remain competitive. The Company competes on the basis of productioncapabilities, engineering and R&D capabilities, materials expertise, its global footprint, globalaccount management where needed, customer service and price. Present or future competitors may havegreater financial, technical or other resources, lower production costs or other pricingadvantages, any of which could put the Company at a disadvantage in the affected business bythreatening its market share or reducing its profit margins. Additionally, in some of its otherbusinesses, the Companys distributors/customers may seek lower cost sourcing opportunities, whichcould cause a loss of business that may adversely impact the Companys revenues.The global nature of our business exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations that couldadversely affect the Companys sales, profits, and cash balances.More than 60 percent of the Companys revenues are derived outside the United States. As such,fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have an adverse impact on its sales and profitsas amounts that are measured in foreign currency are translated back to U.S. dollars. Any increasein the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the value of the local currency will adverselyaffect operating results from the Companys foreign operations when translated into U.S. dollars.Similarly, any decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the value of the localcurrency will increase operating results in the Companys foreign operations when translated intoU.S. dollars. During fiscal 2011, the weakening U.S. dollar versus the majority of other currenciesincreased the Companys sales by $31.1 million.At July 31, 2011, approximately 69% of the Companys cash and cash equivalents were heldoutside the United States. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency can have an adverse impacton the Companys cash balances. Any increase in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to thevalue of various foreign currencies will have a negative impact on cash balances when translatedinto U.S. dollars. Weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies will have a positiveimpact on cash balances when foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars. During fiscal2011, the weakening U.S. dollar versus the majority of other currencies increased the Companyscash and cash equivalents by $22.0 million. 12Table of ContentsThe Companys goodwill or other intangible assets may become impaired, which may negativelyimpact the Companys profitability.The Company has a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on its balancesheet as a result of its acquisitions. As of July 31, 2011, the Company had $800.3 million ofgoodwill on its balance sheet, representing the excess of the total purchase price for itsacquisitions over the fair value of the net assets it acquired, and $90.0 million of otherintangible assets, primarily representing the fair value of the customer relationships, patents andtrademarks it acquired in its acquisitions. At July 31, 2011, goodwill and other intangible assetsrepresented approximately 48% of the Companys total assets. The Company evaluates goodwill forimpairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators are present based on thefair value of each operating segment. It assesses the impairment of other intangible assets on anannual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators are present based upon the expected futurecash flows of the respective assets. These valuations include managements estimates of sales,profitability, cash flow generation, capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capitalexpenditures, and other assumptions. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptionsto the Companys business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpectedsignificant changes or planned changes in use of the assets or in entity structure, anddivestitures may adversely impact the assumptions used in the valuations. If the estimated fairvalue of the Companys operating segments change in future periods, it may be required to record animpairment charge related to goodwill or other intangible assets, which would have the effect ofdecreasing its earnings in such period.The Company has a concentration of business with several large key customers and distributorsand loss of one or more of these customers could significantly affect the Companys results ofoperations, cash flows, and liquidity.While the Company has a broad customer base and no individual customer represents 5% or moreof total net sales, several of the Companys large key customers in the precision die-cut businesstogether comprise a significant portion of its revenues. Additionally, the Company does businesswith several large distribution companies. The Companys dependence on these large customers makesits relationships with these customers important to its business. The Company cannot guarantee thatit will be able to maintain these relationships and retain this business in the future. Becausethese large customers account for a significant portion of the Companys revenues, they possessrelatively greater capacity to negotiate a reduction in the prices the Company charges for itsproducts. If the Company is unable to provide products to its customers at the quality and pricesacceptable to them or adapt to technological changes, some of its customers may in the future electto shift some or all of this business to competitors or to substitute other manufacturersproducts. If one of the Companys key customers consolidates, is acquired by another company orloses market share, the result of that event may have an adverse impact on the Companys business.The loss of or reduction of business from one or more of these large key customers could have amaterial impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, andliquidity.The Company increasingly conducts a sizable amount of its manufacturing outside of the UnitedStates, which may present additional risks to its business.A significant portion of the Companys sales are attributable to products manufactured outsideof the United States. More than half of the Companys approximately 6,500 employees and more thanhalf of its manufacturing locations are outside of the United States. The Companys internationaloperations are generally subject to various risks including political, economic and societalinstability, the imposition of trade restrictions, local labor market conditions, the effects ofincome taxes, and differences in business practices. The Company may incur increased costs andexperience delays or disruptions in product deliveries and payments in connection withinternational manufacturing and sales that could cause loss of revenue. Unfavorable changes in thepolitical, regulatory and business climate in countries where the Company has operations could havea material effect on its financial condition, results of operations, and cash flowsEnvironmental, health and safety laws and regulations could adversely affect the Companysbusiness.The Companys facilities and operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations relatingto climate change, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the handling of hazardous materials andwastes, manufacturing and disposal of certain materials, and regulations otherwise relating tohealth, safety and the protection of the environment. The Companys products may also be governedby regulations in the countries where they are sold. As a result, the Company may need to devotemanagement time or expend significant resources on compliance, and has incurred and will continueto incur capital and other expenditures to comply with these regulations. Any significant costs mayhave a material impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Further, these laws and regulations are constantly evolving and it is impossible to predictaccurately the effect they may have upon the Companys financial condition, results of operationsor cash flows. 13Table of ContentsThe Companys businesses are subject to regulation; failure to comply with those regulationscould adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and reputation.In addition to the environmental regulations noted above, the Companys businesses are subjectto extensive regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and self-regulatory entities at thefederal, state and local levels, including the following:The Company is required to comply with various import laws and export control and economicsanctions laws, which may affect its transactions with certain customers, business partners andother persons and dealings with or between its employees and subsidiaries. In certaincircumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certainproducts, services and technologies, and in other circumstances the Company may be required toobtain an export license before exporting the controlled item.The Company also has agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities orsupply products to companies who resell these products to government entities and are subject tovarious statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. Thelaws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. The Companyis also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements of governmentcontracts, including requirements related to procurement integrity, export control, employmentpractices, the accuracy of records and the recording of costs. A failure to comply with theserequirements might result in suspension of these contracts and suspension or debarment fromgovernment contracting or subcontracting.The Company cannot provide assurance that its internal controls and compliance systems willalways protect the Company from acts committed by the Companys employees, agents or businesspartners that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments togovernment officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims rules, competition, export andimport compliance, money laundering and data privacy. Any such improper actions could subject theCompany to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, could lead tosubstantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuitsand could damage the Companys reputation.The Company may be unable to successfully complete its restructuring plans to reduce costs andincrease efficiencies in its businesses and, therefore, it may not achieve projected financialstatement benefits.The Company continues to implement several measures to address its cost structure. Successfulimplementation of such initiatives is critical to the Companys future competitiveness and itsability to improve profitability. Further actions to reduce the Companys cost structure and thecharges related to these actions may have a material effect on the Companys results of operationsand financial condition"

As global economic conditions deteriorate or economic uncertaintyincreases, our customers and potential customers may experience deterioration of their businesses,which may result in the delay or cancellation of plans to purchase our products. Our sensitivity toeconomic cycles and any related fluctuations in the businesses of our customers or potentialcustomers may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations,cash flows, or liquidity.Demand for the Companys products may be susceptible to fluctuations in the major marketsserved that may cause volatility in its results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity.Sales of the Companys products may be susceptible to changes in market conditions. TheCompanys business in the safety and facility identification and wire and cable identificationproduct lines tends to vary with the nominal GDP of the local economies in which the Companymanufactures and sells. As a result, in periods of economic contraction, the business is likely todecline. In the precision die-cut and high performance identification product lines, the Companymay be adversely affected by reduced demand for products due to downturns in the global economy asthis is a more volatile business. This can result in higher degrees of volatility in the Companysnet sales, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity. These more volatile markets include,but are not limited to, mobile telecommunication devices, hard disk drives and electronics inpersonal computers and other electronic devices.Failure to meet certain financial covenants required by our debt agreements may adverselyaffect our assets, financial position, cash flows, and liquidity.The Companys debt and revolving loan agreements require it to maintain certain financialcovenants. The June 2004, February 2006, March 2007 and May 2010 debt agreements require theCompany to maintain a ratio of debt to the trailing twelve months earnings before interest, taxes,depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), as defined in the debt agreements, of not more than a 3.5to 1.0 ratio (leverage ratio). The October 2006 revolving loan agreement requires the Company tomaintain a ratio of debt to trailing twelve months EBITDA, as defined by the debt agreement, of notmore than a 3.0 to 1.0 ratio. Additionally, the revolving loan agreement requires the trailingtwelve months earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to interest expense of not less than a3.0 to 1.0 ratio (interest expense coverage). The debt agreements also require that the aggregatenet book value of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of by the Company and its subsidiaries, asdefined in the agreement, in any fiscal year of the Company shall not exceed 15% of consolidatedtangible net worth.If we breach any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from thelenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, the outstanding indebtedness (and any otherindebtedness with cross-default provisions) could be declared immediately due and payable, whichwould adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.An increase in the Companys level of debt could adversely affect our financial health.An increase in the Companys level of debt, which historically has occurred to financeacquisitions and for other general corporate purposes, could adversely impact: obligations underexisting debt agreements; ability to obtain additional financing for future growth; future interestrates; cash flows available to fund new product development; capital expenditures; working capitaland other general corporate activities; and the Companys flexibility in planning and reacting tochanges in the business. 10Table of ContentsThe Companys net earnings could be affected by changes in tax legislation or tax rates.Additionally, audits by taxing authorities could result in tax payments for prior periods.The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many non-U.S. jurisdictions.

Some of the proposals would eliminate provisions that historically benefited theCompanys effective tax rate. Additionally, certain tax provisions in the U.S. recently lapsed,including the Research and Development Tax Credit and the controlled foreign corporationlook-through rule.

     Before making an investment decision with respect to the Companys stock, you should carefullyconsider the risks set forth below and all other information contained in this report. If any ofthe events contemplated by the following risks actually occur, then the Companys business,financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, or liquidity could be materially adverselyaffected.     The Companys operating results, cash flows, and liquidity are susceptible to uncertaintiesarising from the length and severity of the current worldwide economic downturn, as well as thetiming and strength of the subsequent recovery.     The global economic downturn has negatively impacted the Companys sales volumes and resultsof operations. All of the segments and most of the major product lines, channels, and marketsserved by the Company, have experienced significant declines in the current global economicdownturn. As a result of the slowing economy, the credit market crisis, declining consumer andbusiness confidence, increased unemployment, reduced levels of capital expenditures, fluctuatingcommodity prices, bankruptcies, and other challenges affecting the global economy, customers mayexperience deterioration of their businesses, cash flow shortages, and difficulty obtainingfinancing. As a result, customers already have reduced or canceled orders and may continue todelay, cancel or further reduce their orders. In addition customers ability to pay their invoicesmay be reduced resulting in increased past due receivables or bad debt. Further, the Companysvendors may be experiencing similar conditions, which may impact their ability to fulfill theirobligations leading to longer days sales outstanding. Although governments around the world areenacting various economic stimulus programs, there can be no assurance as to the timing oreffectiveness of such programs. If the worldwide economic downturn continues for a significantperiod or there is further deterioration in the global economy, the Companys results ofoperations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In responseto the severe downturn, the Company has reduced its worldwide workforce by approximately 25%. Thismay cause disruptions in our operations, customer service, quality, and profitability.     Market demand for the Companys products may be susceptible to fluctuations in the economythat may cause volatility in its results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity.     Sales of the Companys products may be susceptible to changes in general economic conditions,namely general downturns in the regional economies in which the Company competes. The Companysbusiness in the facility & safety identification and wire identification product lines tend to varywith the nominal GDP of the local economies in which the Company manufactures and sells. As aresult, in periods of economic contraction, the business is likely to decline. In thecurrent economic downturn, the Companys business has contracted severely, well in excess of GDP.In addition, the significant drop in non-residential construction has impacted the Companys MRObusiness. In the precision die-cut and high performance label product lines, the Company may beadversely affected by reduced demand for products due to downturns in the global economy as this isa more volatile business. This can result in higher degrees of volatility in the Companys netsales, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity. These more volatile markets include, butare not limited to, mobile telecommunication devices, hard disk drives and electronics in personalcomputers and other electronic devices.11Table of Contents     Uncertainties in the global economy may put pressure on the Companys ability to maintaincompliance with its debt covenants.     The Companys debt and revolving loan agreements require it to maintain certain financialcovenants.

The October 2006 revolving loan agreement requires the Company tomaintain a ratio of debt to trailing twelve months EBITDA, as defined by the debt agreement, of notmore than a 3.0 to 1.0 ratio. Additionally, the revolving loan agreement requires the trailingtwelve months earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to interest expense of not less than a3.0 to 1.0 ratio (interest expense coverage). The debt agreements also require the aggregate netbook value of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of by the Company and its subsidiaries in alldispositions, as defined in the agreement, in any fiscal year of the Company shall not exceed 15%of consolidated tangible net worth. Depending on the severity and duration of the current globaleconomic crisis, uncertainties in the market may put pressure on the Companys ability to maintaincompliance with its covenants.     The Company may experience unforeseen tax consequences.     The Company periodically reviews the probability of the realization of its deferred taxassets based on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. As partof this review, the Company utilizes historical results, projected future operating results,eligible carry forward periods, tax planning opportunities, and other relevant considerations.Adverse changes in profitability and financial outlook in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions,or changes in its geographic footprint may require changes in the valuation allowances to reduceits deferred tax assets or increase tax payments. Such changes could result in material non-cashexpenses in the period in which the changes are made and could have a material adverse impact onthe Companys results of operations or financial condition.     Income tax regulations may change, thus negatively impacting the Companys future operatingresults.     The Company conducts business internationally. As a result, its financial results may benegatively impacted by changes in international taxation rules in the United States. If UnitedStates international tax law changes are enacted as currently outlined (for example, if the tax ondeferred income generated outside the U.S. were enacted), it may have a significant negative impacton the Companys reported financial results and cash flows from operations.     The Company may be adversely impacted by an inability to identify, complete and integrateacquisitions.     A large part of the Companys growth since fiscal 2003 has come through acquisitions and a keycomponent of its growth strategy is based upon acquisitions. The Company may not be able toidentify acquisition targets or successfully complete acquisitions in the future due to the absenceof quality companies, economic conditions, or price expectations from sellers. If the Company isunable to complete additional acquisitions, its growth may be limited.     Additionally, as the Company grows through acquisitions, it will continue to place significantdemands on its management, operational and financial resources. Since the beginning of fiscal year2004, the Company has acquired 28 companies. These recent and future acquisitions will requireintegration of sales and marketing, information technology, finance and administrative operationsand information of the newly acquired business. The successful integration of acquisitions willrequire substantial attention from its management and the management of the acquired businesses,which could decrease the time management has to serve and attract customers. The Company cannotassure that it will be able to successfully integrate these recent or any future acquisitions, thatthese acquisitions will operate profitably or that it will be able to achieve the financial oroperational success expected from the acquisitions. The Companys financial condition, cash flowsand operational results could be adversely affected if it does not successfully integrate the newlyacquired businesses or if its other businesses suffer on account of the increased focus on thenewly acquired businesses.12Table of Contents     If the Company fails to develop new products or its customers do not accept the new productsit develops, the Companys business could be affected adversely.     Development of proprietary products is key to the success of the Companys core growth andhigh gross margins now and in the future. Therefore, the Company must continue to develop new andinnovative products and acquire and retain the necessary intellectual property rights in theseproducts on an ongoing basis. If it fails to make innovations, launches products with qualityproblems, or the market does not accept its new products, then the Companys financial condition,results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity could be adversely affected. The Company continuesto invest in the development and marketing of new products. These expenditures do not always resultin products that will be accepted by the market. Failure to develop successful new products mayalso cause its customers to buy from a competitor or may cause the Company to lower its prices inorder to compete. This could have an adverse impact on the Companys profitability.     The Company operates in competitive markets and may be forced to cut its prices or incuradditional costs to remain competitive, which may have a negative impact on its profitability.     The Company faces substantial competition throughout its entire business, but particularly inthe precision die-cut business. Competition may force the Company to cut its prices or incuradditional costs to remain competitive. The Company competes on the basis of productioncapabilities, engineering and R&D capabilities, materials expertise, its global footprint, customerservice and price. Present or future competitors may have greater financial, technical or otherresources, lower production costs or other pricing advantages, any of which could put the Companyat a disadvantage in the affected business by threatening its market share in some markets orreducing its profit margins. Additionally, in some of its other businesses, the Companysdistributors/customers may seek lower cost sourcing opportunities, which could cause a loss ofbusiness that may adversely impact the Companys revenues.     Foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect the Companys sales, profits, and cashbalances.     More than 60 percent of the Companys revenues are derived outside the United States. Assuch, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have an adverse impact on its sales andprofits as amounts that are measured in foreign currency are translated back to U.S. dollars. Anyincrease in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the value of the local currency willadversely affect operating results from the Companys foreign operations when translated into U.S.dollars. Similarly, any decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the value of thelocal currency will increase operating results in the Companys foreign operations when translatedinto U.S. dollars. During fiscal year 2009, the strengthening U.S. dollar versus the majority ofother currencies decreased sales by approximately $73.2 million.     As of July 31, 2009, approximately 79% of the Companys cash and cash equivalents were heldoutside the United States. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency can have an adverseimpact on the Companys cash balances. Any increase in the value of the U.S. dollar in relationto the value of various foreign currencies will have a negative impact on cash balances whentranslated into U.S. dollars. Weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies will have apositive impact on cash balances when foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars.     The Companys goodwill or other intangible assets may become impaired, which may negativelyimpact its results of operations.     The Company has a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on its balancesheet as a result of its acquisitions. As of July 31, 2009, the Company had $751.2 million ofgoodwill on its balance sheet, representing the excess of the total purchase price for itsacquisitions over the fair value of the net assets it acquired, and $115.8 million of otherintangible assets, primarily representing the fair value of the customer relationships, patentsand trademarks it acquired in its acquisitions. At July 31, 2009, goodwill and other intangibleassets represented approximately 54.8% of its total assets. The Company evaluates goodwill atleast annually for impairment based on the fair value of each operating segment. It assesses theimpairment of other intangible assets at least annually based upon the expected future cash flowsof the respective assets. These valuations include managements estimates of sales,profitability, cash flow generation, capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capitalexpenditures, and other assumptions. A worldwide economic downturn, credit crisis, or uncertaintyin the13Table of Contentsmarkets the Company serves can adversely impact the assumptions in these valuations. If theestimated fair values of the Companys operating segments change in future periods, it may berequired to record an impairment charge related to goodwill or other intangible assets, whichwould have the effect of decreasing its earnings in such period.     The Company has a concentration of business with several large key customers and distributorsand loss of one or more of these customers could significantly affect the Companys results ofoperations, cash flows, and liquidity.     Several of the Companys large key customers in the precision die-cut business togethercomprise a significant portion of its revenues. The Companys largest customer representsapproximately 6% of its net sales. Additionally, the Company does business with several largedistribution companies. The Companys dependence on these large customers makes its relationshipswith these customers important to its business. The Company cannot guarantee that it will be ableto maintain these relationships and retain this business in the future. Because these largecustomers account for a significant portion of the Companys revenues, they possess relativelygreater capacity to negotiate a reduction in the prices the Company charges for its products. Ifthe Company is unable to provide products to its customers at the quality and prices acceptable tothem or adapt to technological changes, some of its customers may in the future elect to shift someor all of this business to competitors or to substitute other manufacturers products. If one ofthe Companys key customers consolidates, is acquired by another company or loses market share, theresult of that event may have an adverse impact on the Companys business. The loss of orreduction of business from one or more of these large key customers could have a material adverseimpact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity.     The Company increasingly conducts a sizable amount of its manufacturing outside of the UnitedStates, which may present additional risks to its business.     As a result of its strong growth in developing economies, particularly in Asia, a significantportion of the Companys sales are attributable to products manufactured outside of the UnitedStates. More than half of the Companys approximately 6,800 employees and more than half of itsmanufacturing locations are outside of the United States. The Companys international operationsare generally subject to various risks including political, economic and societal instability, theimposition of trade restrictions, local labor market conditions, the effects of income taxes, anddifferences in business practices. The Company may incur increased costs and experience delays ordisruptions in product deliveries and payments in connection with international manufacturing andsales that could cause loss of revenue. Unfavorable changes in the political, regulatory andbusiness climate in countries where the Company has operations could have a material adverse effecton its financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.     The Company depends on its key personnel and the loss of these personnel could have anadverse effect on the Companys operations.     The Companys success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of its keyexecutives, managers and other skilled personnel. The Company cannot ensure that it will be able toretain its key officers and employees. The departure of key personnel without adequate replacementcould severely disrupt business operations. Additionally, the Company needs qualified managers andskilled employees with technical and manufacturing industry experience to operate its businesssuccessfully. If it is unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or the costs to do soincrease significantly, the Companys operations would be materially adversely affected. Due tothe severe economic downturn, the Company reduced its workforce by approximately 25%. While theCompany believes it can adequately operate the business at current staffing levels, sudden changesin demand may be difficult to react to with a reduced workforce. Additionally, the potentialimpact of a serious virus such as H1N1 may affect the Companys workforce and its ability tooperate the business successfully.     The Company may be unable to successfully implement anticipated changes to its informationtechnology system.     The Company is in the process of upgrading certain portions of its information technology.Part of this upgrade includes continued implementations of SAP and additional functionality forfinancial systems. The Company expects that these migrations will enable it to more effectively andefficiently manage its operations and further improve businessprocesses. The Company is also in the process of upgrading its14Table of Contentse-business andsales force applications in fiscal 2010. The Company expects these upgrades will enableimprovements of its on-line business and increase productivity. The Companys failure tosuccessfully manage these improvements as scheduled could cause it to incur unexpected costs or tolose customers or sales, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial results.     An increase in the Companys level of indebtedness could adversely affect its financialhealth and make it vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.     Any increase in the Companys level of indebtedness, which historically has occurred tofinance acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes, could have adverse consequences,such as:  it may be difficult for the Company to fulfill its obligations under its credit or otherdebt agreements;   it may be more challenging or costly to obtain additional financing to fund futuregrowth;   the Company may be more vulnerable to future interest rate fluctuations;   the Company may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flows toservice its debt, thereby reducing the amount of cash available to fund new productdevelopment, capital expenditures, working capital and other general corporate activities;   it may place the Company at a competitive disadvantage relative to its competitors thathave less debt; and   it may limit the Companys flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in itsbusiness.     Environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could adversely affect the Companysbusiness.     The Companys facilities and operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations relatingto air emissions, wastewater discharges, the handling of hazardous materials and wastes,manufacturing and disposal of certain materials, and regulations otherwise relating to health,safety and the protection of the environment. The Companys products may also be governed byregulations in the countries where they are sold. As a result, the Company may need to devotemanagement time or expend significant resources on compliance, and has incurred and will continueto incur capital and other expenditures to comply with these regulations. Any significant costs mayhave a material adverse impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cashflows. Further, these laws and regulations are constantly evolving and it is impossible to predictaccurately the effect they may have upon the Companys financial condition, results of operationsor cash flows.     The Companys businesses are subject to regulation; failure to comply with those regulationscould adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and reputation.     In addition to the environmental regulations noted above, the Companys businesses are subjectto extensive regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and self-regulatory entities at thefederal, state and local levels, including the following:     The Company is required to comply with various import laws and export control and economicsanctions laws, which may affect its transactions with certain customers, business partners andother persons and dealings with or between its employees and subsidiaries. In certaincircumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certainproducts, services and technologies, and in other circumstances the Company may be required toobtain an export license before exporting the controlled item.     The Company also has agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities orsupply products to companies who resell these products to government entities and are subject tovarious statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. Thelaws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. The Companyis also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with therequirements governing government contracts, including requirements related to procurement integrity, export15Table of Contentscontrol, employment practices, the accuracy of records and the recording ofcosts. A failure to comply with these requirements might result in suspension of these contractsand suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting.     The Company may be unable to successfully complete its restructuring plans to reduce costs and increase efficiencies in its businesses and, therefore, it may not achieve projected financial statement benefits.     The Company continues to initiate several measures to address its cost structure and projected operational and market requirements.  Successful implementation of such initiatives is critical to the Companys futurecompetitiveness and its ability to improve profitability.  Further actions to reduce the Companys cost structure and the charges related to these actions may have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations and financial condition"
12,BRC,BRADY CORP,2008-09-26,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
     Before making an investment decision with respect to our stock, you should carefully considerthe risks set forth below and all other information contained in this report. If any of the eventscontemplated by the following risks actually occur, then our business, financial condition, resultsof operations, cash flow, or liquidity could be materially adversely affected.Market demand for our products may be susceptible to fluctuations in the economy that may causevolatility in our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity.     Sales of our products may be susceptible to changes in general economic conditions, namelygeneral downturns in the regional economies in which we compete. Our business in the facility &safety identification and wire identification product lines tend to vary with the nominal GDP ofthe local economies in which we manufacture and sell. As a result, in periods of economiccontraction, our business may not grow or may decline. In the precision die-cut and highperformance label product lines, we may be adversely affected by reduced demand for our productsdue to downturns in the global economy as this is a more volatile business. This can result inhigher degrees of volatility in our net sales, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity.These more volatile markets include, but are not limited to, mobile telecommunication devices, harddisk drives and electronics in personal computers and other electronic devices.We may be adversely impacted by an inability to identify, complete and integrate acquisitions.     A large part of our growth since fiscal 2003 has come through acquisitions and a key componentof our growth strategy is based upon acquisitions. We may not be able to identify acquisitiontargets or successfully complete acquisitions in the future due to the absence of qualitycompanies, economic conditions, or price expectations from sellers. If we are unable to completeadditional acquisitions, our growth may be limited.     Additionally, as we grow through acquisitions, it will continue to place significant demandson our management, operational and financial resources. Since the beginning of fiscal year 2004, wehave acquired 28 companies. These recent and future acquisitions will require integration of salesand marketing, information technology, finance and administrative operations and information of thenewly acquired business. The successful integration of acquisitions will require substantialattention from our management and the management of the acquired businesses, which could decreasethe time they have to serve and attract customers. We cannot assure that we will be able tosuccessfully integrate these recent or any future acquisitions, that these acquisitions willoperate profitably or that we will be able to achieve the financial or operational success expectedfrom the acquisitions. Our financial condition, cash flows and operational results could beadversely affected if we do not successfully integrate the newly acquired businesses or if ourother businesses suffer on account of our increased focus on the newly acquired businesses.If we fail to develop new products or our customers do not accept the new products we develop, ourbusiness could be affected adversely.     Development of proprietary products is key to the success of our core growth and our highgross margins now and in the future. Therefore, we must continue to develop new and innovativeproducts and acquire and retain the necessary intellectual property rights in these products on anongoing basis. If we fail to make innovations, or the market does not accept our new products, thenour financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity could be adverselyaffected. We continue to invest in the development and marketing of new products. Theseexpenditures do not always result in products that will be accepted by the market. Failure todevelop successful new products may also cause our customers to buy from a competitor or may causeus to lower our prices in order to compete. This could have an adverse impact on our profitability.10Table of Contents     We operate in competitive markets and may be forced to cut our prices or incur additionalcosts to remain competitive, which may have a negative impact on our profitability.     We face substantial competition throughout our entire business, but particularly in theprecision die-cut business. Competition may force us to cut our prices or incur additional costs toremain competitive. We compete on the basis of production capabilities, engineering and R&Dcapabilities, materials expertise, our global footprint, customer service and price. Present orfuture competitors may have greater financial, technical or other resources, lower production costsor other pricing advantages, any of which could put us at a disadvantage in the affected businessby threatening our market share in some markets or reducing our profit margins. Additionally, insome of our other businesses, our distributors/customers may seek lower cost sourcingopportunities, which could cause a loss of business that may adversely impact our revenues.Foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect our sales and profits.     More than 60% of our revenues are derived outside of the United States. As such, fluctuationsin foreign currency can have an adverse impact on our sales and profits as amounts that aremeasured in foreign currency are translated back to U.S. dollars. Any increase in the value of theU.S. dollar in relation to the value of the local currency will adversely affect our revenues fromour foreign operations when translated into U.S. dollars. Similarly, any decrease in the value ofthe U.S. dollar in relation to the value of the local currency will increase our development costsin our foreign operations, to the extent such costs are payable in foreign currency, whentranslated into U.S. dollars. During fiscal year 2008, the weakening U.S. dollar versus themajority of other currencies increased sales by approximately $81.7 million.Our goodwill or other intangible assets may become impaired, which may negatively impact ourresults of operations.     We have a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet as aresult of our acquisitions. As of July 31, 2008, we had $789.1 million of goodwill on our balancesheet, representing the excess of the total purchase price for our acquisitions over the fair valueof the net assets we acquired, and $144.8 million of other intangible assets, primarilyrepresenting the fair value of the customer relationships, patents and trademarks we acquired inour acquisitions. At July 31, 2008, goodwill and other intangible assets represented approximately50.5% of our total assets. We evaluate goodwill at least annually for impairment based on the fairvalue of each operating segment. We assess the impairment of other intangible assets at leastannually based upon the expected future cash flows of the respective assets. These valuations couldchange if there were to be future changes in our capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates,capital expenditures, or our ability to perform in accordance with our forecasts. If this estimatedfair value changes in future periods, we may be required to record an impairment charge related togoodwill or other intangible assets, which would have the effect of decreasing our earnings orincreasing our losses in such period.We have a concentration of business with several large key customers and distributors and loss ofone or more of these customers could significantly affect our results of operations, cash flows,and liquidity.     Several of our large key customers in the precision die-cut business together comprise asignificant portion of our revenues. Our largest customer represents approximately 6% of our netsales. Additionally, we do business with several large distribution companies. Our dependence onthese large customers makes our relationships with these customers important to our business. Wecannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain these relationships and retain this business inthe future. Because these large customers account for such a significant portion of our revenues,they possess relatively greater capacity to negotiate a reduction in the prices we charge for ourproducts. If we are unable to provide products to our customers at the quality and pricesacceptable to them or adapt to technological changes, some of our customers may in the future electto shift some or all of this business to competitors or to substitute other manufacturersproducts. If one of our key customers consolidates, is acquired by another company or loses marketshare, the result of that event may have an adverse impact on our business. The loss of orreduction of business from one or more of these large key customers could have a material adverseimpact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity.We increasingly conduct a sizable amount of our manufacturing outside of the United States, whichmay present additional risks to our business.     As a result of our strong growth in developing economies, particularly in Asia, a significantportion of our sales is attributable to products manufactured outside of the United States. Morethan half of our approximately 7,800 employees and more than half of our manufacturing locationsare outside of the United States. Our international operations are generally subject to variousrisks including11Table of Contentspolitical, economic and societal instability, the imposition of trade restrictions, locallabor market conditions, the effects of income taxes, and differences in business practices. We mayincur increased costs and experience delays or disruptions in product deliveries and payments inconnection with international manufacturing and sales that could cause loss of revenue. Unfavorablechanges in the political, regulatory and business climate in countries where we have operationscould have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cashflows.We depend on our key personnel and the loss of these personnel could have an adverse effect on ouroperations.     Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our key executives,managers and other skilled personnel. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain our keyofficers and employees. The departure of our key personnel without adequate replacement couldseverely disrupt our business operations. Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilledemployees with technical and manufacturing industry experience to operate our businesssuccessfully. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our costs to do soincrease significantly, our operations would be materially adversely affected.We may be unable to successfully implement anticipated changes to our information technologysystem.     We are in the process of upgrading certain portions of our information technology. Part ofthis upgrade includes continued implementations of SAP in our facilities in China, Europe,Malaysia, Singapore, Mexico, India and the United States. In fiscal years 2007 and 2008, wecompleted SAP implementations at 24 of our facilities in these regions, and expect to continue withadditional implementations in future years. We expect that the implementation of the SAP platformwill enable us to more effectively and efficiently manage our supply chain and business processes.Our failure to successfully manage the SAP implementation process or implement these upgrades asscheduled could cause us to incur unexpected costs or to lose customers or sales, which could havea material adverse effect on our financial results.The increase in our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and make usvulnerable to adverse economic conditions.     We have incurred indebtedness to finance acquisitions and for other general corporatepurposes. Any increase in our level of indebtedness could have adverse consequences, such as:  it may be difficult for us to fulfill our obligations under our credit or other debtagreements;   it may be more challenging or costly to obtain additional financing to fund our futuregrowth;   we may be more vulnerable to future interest rate fluctuations;   we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to service ourdebt, thereby reducing the amount of cash available to fund new product development, capitalexpenditures, working capital and other general corporate activities;   it may place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that have lessdebt; and   it may limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business.Environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could adversely affect our business.     Our facilities and operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to airemissions, wastewater discharges, the handling of hazardous materials and wastes, manufacturing anddisposal of certain materials, and regulations otherwise relating to health, safety and theprotection of the environment. Our products may also be governed by regulations in the countrieswhere they are sold. As a result, we may need to devote management time or expend significantresources on compliance, and we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and otherexpenditures to comply with these regulations. Any significant costs may have a material adverseimpact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Further, these laws andregulations are constantly evolving and it is impossible to predict accurately the effect they mayhave upon our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows"

Bradys    core capabilities in manufacturing, channel management, printing    systems, precision engineering and materials expertise make it a    leading supplier to the Maintenance, Repair and Operations    (MRO) market and to the Original Equipment    Manufacturing (OEM) market. The Companys    ability to provide customers with a broad range of    differentiated solutions both through the organic development of    its existing business and the acquisition of complementary and    adjacent businesses, its commitment to quality and service, its    global footprint and its diversified sales channels have made it    a world leader in its markets.     Brady manufactures and markets a wide range of products for use    in diverse applications. Major product lines provided to the MRO    market include facility identification, safety and complementary    products, wire and cable identification products, sorbent    materials, people identification products and regulatory    publishing.

The international experience of its management    team and its commitment to developing strong management teams in    each of the local operations is a competitive advantage. In    addition, the Company believes it employs a world-class team of    people and dedicates significant resources to recruiting people    committed to excellence and investing in their potential. The    depth and breadth of knowledge within the entire Brady    organization strengthens relationships with its customers and    suppliers and enables the Company to provide its customers with    a high level of product and industry expertise. Key    Strategies     The Companys primary growth objectives are to build upon    its leading market positions, to improve its performance and    profitability and to expand its existing activities through a    multi-prong strategic approach that incorporates both organic    growth and acquisitions. The Companys key strategies    include: Capitalize on Growing Niche Markets.  The    Company seeks to leverage its premier reputation, global    footprint and strength in manufacturing and materials expertise    to capitalize on growth in existing niche markets. Growth    prospects in the MRO market are driven primarily by the general    health of regional economies, changes in legal and regulatory    compliance requirements and the increased need of customers to    identify their assets and protect their employees. Demand for    OEM products is primarily driven by the strength of various    electronics markets, such as mobile telecommunications, portable    electronic devices, disk drives and computers, as well as    technological advances in these markets and other industrial    OEMs. Increase Market Share.  Many Brady markets are    fragmented and populated with smaller or regional competitors.    The Company seeks to leverage its investment in new product    development and its global sales, operations and distribution    capabilities to increase market share, as well as expand its    distribution channels to capture new customers. The Company    employs a dedicated and experienced sales team that works    closely with existing customers to identify and capture new    opportunities. In addition, Brady plans to leverage the strength    of its brands, the quality of its products and its long-standing    relationships with key customers to build upon current market    positions. Enter New Markets.  The Company looks to    leverage its quality products, global infrastructure, channel    relationships and selling capabilities to effectively enter new    markets, many of which are fragmented and populated with smaller    competitors. For example, Brady is expanding its precision    die-cut capabilities into the medical market and is leveraging    its common distribution networks into the sorbent materials    market. Through product innovation and development activities,    Brady seeks to introduce new technologies and differentiated    products as well as seek additional applications for products in    existing and new markets. The Company reviews its product and    market portfolio on a regular basis through its standardized    review process in order to identify new product opportunities. Expand Geographically.  Bradys long-term    strategy involves the pursuit of growth opportunities in a    number of markets outside of the United States. The Company is    committed to being in close proximity to its customers and to    low-cost manufacturing. Brady currently operates in 28 countries    and employs approximately 3,900 people, approximately 45%    of its total workforce, in developing regions. Brady has made    strategic acquisitions and has invested heavily in its global    infrastructure and flexible manufacturing capacity in order to    follow its customers into new geographies. Bradys regional    management structure is a key component in effectively entering    and competing in new geographies. Pursue Strategic Acquisitions.  The Company    intends to continue to make complementary strategic acquisitions    to further its goal of strengthening its market positions and    entering new markets and geographies. Brady works to drive    substantial value creation through capitalizing on its    acquisition and integration acumen. Improve Profitability.  The Company plans to    continue its focus on improving operating efficiency, reducing    costs, and improving productivity and return on assets. In    addition, each acquisition the Company makes provides    I-3Table of Contents    additional opportunities to improve its performance as well as    the performance of the acquired company. The Company often    continues to realize synergies with acquired companies several    years after the acquisition date. Products     The Company is largely vertically integrated by designing,    developing, coating and producing most of its identification    signs, labels and printing systems. Brady materials are    developed internally and manufactured out of a variety of films,    predominantly coated by Brady, for applications in the following    markets: electronic, industrial, electrical, utility,    laboratory, safety and security. Brady also manufactures    specialty tapes and related products that are characterized by    high-performance printable top coats and adhesives, most of    which are formulated by the Company, to meet high-tolerance    requirements of the industries in which they are used.     The Companys stock and custom products consist of over    500,000 stock-keeping units, including complete identification    systems and other products used to create a safer work    environment, improve operating efficiencies, and increase the    utilization of assets through tracking and inventory process    controls.

The Company    also offers poster printers, cutting systems, laminators and    supplies to education and training markets. Marketing    and Sales     Brady seeks to offer high quality products with rapid response    and superior service so that it can provide solutions to    customers that are better, faster and more economical than those    available from the Companys competitors. The Company    markets and sells its products domestically and internationally    through multiple channels including distributors, direct sales,    mail-order-catalog marketing, retail, and electronic access    through the Internet. The Company has long-standing    relationships with a broad range of electrical, safety,    industrial and other domestic and international distributors.    The Companys sales force seeks to establish and foster    ongoing relationships with the end-users and distributors by    providing technical application and product expertise.     The Company also direct markets certain products and those of    other manufacturers by catalog sales and outbound telemarketing    in both domestic and international markets. Such products    include industrial and facility identification products, safety    and regulatory-compliance products and original equipment    manufacturer component products, among others. Catalogs are    distributed in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada,    China, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and    the United Kingdom, and include    foreign-language    catalogs.     The Companys products are sold in a wide variety of    markets within the larger MRO and OEM markets, including    electrical, electronic, telecommunications, governmental, public    utility, commercial building, computers and computer components,    construction, general manufacturing, laboratory, transportation    equipment and education. Brands     The Companys products go to market under a variety of    brand names. The Brady brand includes high-performance labels,    printers, software, safety and facility identification products,    lock-out/tag-out products, and precision die-cut parts and    specialty materials.

Plastics, PromoVision,    and Quo-Luck brands; hand-held regulatory documentation systems    are available under the Tiscor name; and automatic    identification and bar code software is offered under the    Teklynx brand. Manufacturing    Process and Raw Materials     The Company manufactures the majority of the products it sells,    while purchasing certain items from other manufacturers.    Products manufactured by the Company generally require a high    degree of precision and the application of adhesives with    chemical and physical properties suited for specific uses. The    Companys manufacturing processes include compounding,    coating, converting, melt-blown operations, software development    and printer design and assembly. The compounding process    involves the mixing of chemical batches for primers, top    coatings and adhesives. The coatings and adhesives are applied    to a wide variety of materials including polyester, polyimide,    cloth, paper, metal and metal foil. The converting process may    include embossing, perforating, laminating, die cutting,    slitting, and printing or marking the materials as required.    I-6Table of Contents    The Company produces the majority of the pressure sensitive    materials through an integrated manufacturing process. These    integrated manufacturing processes permit greater flexibility to    meet customer needs in product design and manufacture, and an    improved ability to provide specialized products designed to    meet the needs of specific applications. Bradys    cellular manufacturing processes and    just-in-time    inventory control are designed to attain profitability in small    orders by emphasizing flexibility and the maximization of assets    through quick turnaround and delivery, balanced with    optimization of lot sizes. Most of the Companys    manufacturing facilities have received ISO 9001 or 9002    certification.     The materials used in the products manufactured by the Company    consist primarily of plastic sheets and films, paper, metal and    metal foil, cloth, fiberglass, polypropylene, inks, dyes,    adhesives, pigments, natural and synthetic rubber, organic    chemicals, polymers, solvents and electronic components and    subassemblies. In addition, the Company purchases finished    products for resale. The Company purchases raw materials,    components and finished products from many suppliers. Overall,    the Company is not dependent upon any single supplier for its    most critical base materials or components; however the Company    has chosen in certain situations to sole source materials,    components or finished items for design or cost reasons. As a    result, disruptions in supply could have an impact on results    for a period of time, but generally these disruptions would    simply require qualification of new suppliers and the disruption    would be modest. In certain instances, the qualification process    could be more costly or take a longer period of time and in rare    circumstances, such as a global shortage of a critical material    or component, the financial impact could be significant. Technology    and Product Development     The Company focuses its research and development efforts on    material development, printing systems design and software    development. Material development involves the application of    surface chemistry concepts for top coatings and adhesives    applied to a variety of base materials. Systems design    integrates materials, embedded software and a variety of    printing technologies to form a complete solution for customer    applications or the Companys own production requirements.    The Companys research and development team also supports    production and marketing efforts by providing application and    technical expertise.     The Company possesses patents covering various aspects of    adhesive chemistry, electronic circuitry, printing systems for    wire markers, systems for aligning letters and patterns, and    visually changing paper. Although the Company believes that its    patents are a significant factor in maintaining market position    for certain products, technology in the areas covered by many of    the patents is evolving rapidly and may limit the value of such    patents. The Companys business is not dependent on any    single patent or group of patents.     The Company conducts much of its research and development    activities at the Frederic S. Tobey Research and Innovation    Center (approximately 39,600 sq. ft.) in Milwaukee,    Wisconsin. The Company spent approximately $36.0 million,    $30.4 million, and $25.1 million during the fiscal    years ended July 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, on    its research and development activities. In fiscal 2007,    approximately 250 employees were engaged in research and    development activities for the Company. Additional research    projects were conducted in Company facilities in other locations    in the United States, Europe and Asia and under contract with    universities, other institutions and consultants.     The Companys name and its registered trademarks are    important to each of its business segments. In addition, the    Company owns other important trademarks applicable to only    certain of its products. International    Operations     In fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, sales from international    operations accounted for 60.9%, 57.6%, and 55.3%, respectively,    of the Companys sales. Its global infrastructure includes    subsidiaries in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China,    Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan,    Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway,    Philippines, Poland, Singapore, Slovakia, South Korea, Spain,    Sweden, Thailand, Turkey and the United Kingdom. Most of these    locations manufacture or have the capability to manufacture    certain of the products they sell. In addition, Brady has sales    offices in Spain, Taiwan, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.    Brady further markets its products to parts of Eastern Europe,    the Middle East, Africa and Russia.    I-7Table of Contents Competition     The markets for all of the Companys products are    competitive. Brady believes that it is one of the leading    domestic producers of wire markers, safety signs, pipe markers,    label printing systems, precision die-cut materials and    bar-code-label-generating software. Brady competes for business    principally on the basis of production capabilities,    engineering, and research and development capabilities,    materials expertise, its global footprint, global account    management where needed, customer service and price. Product    quality is determined by factors such as suitability of    component materials for various applications, adhesive    properties, graphics quality, durability, product consistency    and workmanship. Competition in many of its product markets is    highly fragmented, ranging from smaller companies offering only    one or a few types of products, to some of the worlds    major adhesive and electrical product companies offering some    competing products as part of their overall product lines. A    number of Bradys competitors are larger than the Company    and have greater resources. Notwithstanding the resources of    these competitors, management believes that Brady provides a    broader range of identification solutions than any of them, and    that its global infrastructure is a significant competitive    advantage in serving large multi-national customers. Backlog     As of July 31, 2007, the amount of the Companys    backlog orders believed to be firm was $25.3 million. This    compares with $42.3 million and $24.9 million of    backlog orders as of July 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.    Average delivery time for the Companys orders varies from    one day to one month, depending on the type of product, and    whether the product is stock or custom-designed and    manufactured. Average delivery time for the direct marketing    business can be as low as the same day or the next day. The    Companys backlog does not provide much visibility for    future business. Environment     At present, the manufacturing processes for our adhesive-based    products utilize certain evaporative solvents, which, unless    controlled, would be vented into the atmosphere. Emissions of    these substances are regulated at the federal, state and local    levels. We have implemented a number of systems and procedures    to reduce atmospheric emissions    and/or to    recover solvents. Management believes we are substantially in    compliance with all environmental regulations. Employees     As of July 31, 2007, the Company employed approximately    8,600 individuals. We have never experienced a material work    stoppage due to a labor dispute and consider our relations with    employees to be strong. The mix of employees is changing as we    employ more people in developing countries where wage rates are    lower and employee turnover tends to be higher than in developed    countries. Acquisitions     Information about the Companys acquisitions is provided in    Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements    contained in Item 8  Financial Statements and    Supplementary Data. (d)  Financial    Information About Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export    Sales     The information required by this Item is provided in Note 7    of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in    Item 8  Financial Statements and Supplementary    Data. (e)  Information    Available on the Internet     The Companys Corporate Internet address is    http://www.bradycorp.com.

 Before making an investment decision with respect to our    stock, you should carefully consider the risks set forth below    and all other information contained in this report. If any of    the events contemplated by the following risks actually occur,    then our business, financial condition or results of operations    could be materially adversely affected. Market    demand for our products may be susceptible to fluctuations in    the economy that may cause volatility in our results of    operations.     Sales of our products may be susceptible to changes in general    economic conditions, namely general downturns in the regional    economies in which we compete. Our business in the MRO market    tends to vary with the nominal GDP of the local economies in    which we manufacture and sell. As a result, in periods of    economic contraction, our business may not grow or may decline.    In the OEM market, we may be adversely affected by reduced    demand for our products due to downturns in the global economy    as this is a more volatile business than the MRO business. This    can result in higher degrees of volatility in our net sales and    results of operations. These more volatile markets include, but    are not limited to, mobile telecommunication devices, hard disk    drives and electronics in personal computers and other    electronic devices. Our    current and future success could be impacted by our ability to    effectively integrate acquired companies and manage our    growth.     Our growth has and will continue to place significant demands on    our management and operational and financial resources. Since    the beginning of fiscal year 2004, we have acquired    26 companies. These recent and future acquisitions will    require integration of sales and marketing, information    technology, finance and administrative operations and    information of the newly acquired business. The successful    integration of acquisitions will require substantial attention    from our management and the management of the acquired    businesses, which could decrease the time they have to serve and    attract customers. We cannot assure that we will be able to    successfully integrate these recent or any future acquisitions,    that these acquisitions will operate profitably or that we will    be able to achieve the financial or operational success expected    from the acquisitions. Our financial condition, cash flows and    operational results could be adversely affected if we do not    successfully integrate the newly acquired businesses or if our    other businesses suffer on account of our increased focus on the    newly acquired businesses. If we    fail to develop new products or our customers do not accept the    new products we develop, our business could be affected    adversely.     Development of proprietary products is key to the success of our    core growth and our high gross margins now and in the future.    Therefore, we must continue to develop new and innovative    products and acquire and retain the necessary intellectual    property rights in these products on an ongoing basis. If we    fail to make innovations, or the market does not accept our new    products, then our financial condition and results of operations    could be adversely affected. We continue to invest in the    development and marketing of new products. These expenditures do    not always result in products that will be accepted by the    market. Failure to develop successful new products may also    cause our customers to buy from a competitor or may cause us to    lower our prices in order to compete. This could have an adverse    impact on our profitability. We may    be adversely impacted by an inability to identify and complete    acquisitions.     A large part of our growth since fiscal 2003 has come through    acquisitions and a key component of our growth strategy is based    upon acquisitions. We may not be able to identify acquisition    targets or successfully complete acquisitions in the future due    to the absence of quality companies, economic conditions, or    price expectations from sellers. If we are unable to complete    additional acquisitions, our growth may be limited.    I-9Table of ContentsWe    operate in competitive markets and may be forced to cut our    prices or incur additional costs to remain competitive, which    may have a negative impact on our profitability.     We face substantial competition, particularly in the OEM markets    we serve. Competition may force us to cut our prices or incur    additional costs to remain competitive. We compete on the basis    of production capabilities, engineering and R&D    capabilities, materials expertise, our global footprint,    customer service and price. Present or future competitors may    have greater financial, technical or other resources, lower    production costs or other pricing advantages, any of which could    put us at a disadvantage in the affected business by threatening    our market share in some markets or reducing our profit margins. Our    goodwill or other intangible assets may become impaired, which    may negatively impact our results of operations.     We have a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible    assets on our balance sheet as a result of our acquisitions. As    of July 31, 2007, we had $737.5 million of goodwill on    our balance sheet, representing the excess of the total purchase    price for our acquisitions over the fair value of the net assets    we acquired, and $149.8 million of other intangible assets,    primarily representing the fair value of the customer    relationships, patents and trademarks we acquired in our    acquisitions. At July 31, 2007, goodwill and other    intangible assets represented approximately 52% of our total    assets. We evaluate this goodwill annually for impairment based    on the fair value of each operating segment. We assess the    impairment of other intangible assets quarterly based upon the    expected future cash flows of the respective assets. These    valuations could change if there were to be future changes in    our capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital    expenditures, or our ability to perform in accordance with our    forecasts. If this estimated fair value changes in future    periods, we may be required to record an impairment charge    related to goodwill or other intangible assets, which would have    the effect of decreasing our earnings or increasing our losses    in such period. We    have a concentration of business with several large key    customers and distributors and loss of one or more of these    customers could significantly affect our results of    operations.     Several of our large key customers in the OEM market,    specifically the precision die-cut business, together comprise a    significant portion of our revenues. Our largest customer    represents approximately 5% of our net sales. Additionally in    the MRO markets, we do business with several large distribution    companies. Our dependence on these large customers makes our    relationships with these customers important to our business. We    cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain these    relationships and retain this business in the future. Because    these large customers account for such a significant portion of    our revenues, they possess relatively greater capacity to    negotiate a reduction in the prices we charge for our products.    If we are unable to provide products to our customers at prices    acceptable to them, some of our customers may in the future    elect to shift some or all of this business to competitors or to    substitute other manufacturers products. If one of our key    customers consolidates, is acquired by another company or loses    market share, the result of that event may have an adverse    impact on our business. The loss of or reduction of business    from one or more of these large key customers could have a    material adverse impact on our financial condition and results    of operations. We    increasingly conduct a sizable amount of our manufacturing    outside of the United States, which may present additional risks    to our business.     As a result of our strong growth in developing economies,    particularly in Asia, a significant portion of our sales is    attributable to products manufactured outside of the United    States. More than half of our approximately 8,600 employees    and more than half of our manufacturing locations are outside of    the United States. Our international operations are generally    subject to various risks including political, economic and    societal instability, the imposition of trade restrictions,    local labor market conditions, the effects of income taxes, and    differences in business practices. We may incur increased costs    and experience delays or disruptions in product deliveries and    payments in connection with international manufacturing and    sales that could cause loss of revenue. Unfavorable changes in    the political, regulatory and business climate in countries    where we have operations could have a material adverse effect on    our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    I-10Table of ContentsOur    ability to continue to source low cost MRO products from regions    such as China may decline. Conversely, low cost sourcing may    also present risks to our revenue if our MRO customers choose to    source cheaper products from low cost regions.     An increasing portion of our MRO products is expected to be    sourced from low cost regions in the future. Changes in export    laws, suppliers and disruption in transportation routes could    lessen our ability to source these products and adversely impact    our results. Additionally, our MRO distributors/customers may    seek low cost sourcing opportunities directly, which could cause    a loss of business that may adversely impact our revenues. Foreign    currency fluctuations could adversely affect our sales and    profits.     More than half of our revenues are derived outside of the United    States. As such, fluctuations in foreign currency can have an    adverse impact on our sales and profits as amounts that are    measured in foreign currency are translated back to    U.S. dollars. Any increase in the value of the    U.S. dollar in relation to the value of the local currency    will adversely affect our revenues from our foreign operations    when translated into U.S. dollars. Similarly, any decrease    in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the value of    the local currency will increase our development costs in our    foreign operations, to the extent such costs are payable in    foreign currency, when translated into U.S. dollars. During    fiscal year 2007, the weakening U.S. dollar versus the    majority of other currencies increased sales by approximately    $41.7 million. We    depend on our key personnel and the loss of these personnel    could have an adverse effect on our operations.     Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued    services of our key executives, managers and other skilled    personnel. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain our    key officers and employees. The departure of our key personnel    without adequate replacement could severely disrupt our business    operations. Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilled    employees with technical and manufacturing industry experience    to operate our business successfully. If we are unable to    attract and retain qualified individuals or our costs to do so    increase significantly, our operations would be materially    adversely affected. We may    be unable to successfully implement anticipated changes to our    information technology system.     We are now in the process of upgrading certain portions of our    information technology. Part of this upgrade includes continued    implementations of SAP in our facilities in China, Europe,    Malaysia, Singapore, Mexico, India and the United States. In    fiscal 2007, we completed the implementation at 16 of our    facilities in these regions, and expect to continue this pace in    future years. We expect that this implementation of the SAP    platform will enable us to more effectively and efficiently    manage our supply chain and business processes. Our failure to    successfully manage the SAP implementation process or implement    these upgrades as scheduled could cause us to incur unexpected    costs or to lose customers or sales, which could have a material    adverse effect on our financial results. The    increase in our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our    financial health and make us vulnerable to adverse economic    conditions.     We have incurred indebtedness to finance acquisitions and for    other general corporate purposes. Any increase in our level of    indebtedness could have important consequences, such as:           it may be difficult for us to fulfill our obligations under our    credit or other debt agreements;           it may be more challenging or costly to obtain additional    financing to fund our future growth;           we may be more vulnerable to future interest rate fluctuations;           we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash    flows to service our debt, thereby reducing the amount of cash    available to fund new product development, capital expenditures,    working capital and other general corporate activities;    I-11Table of Contents           it may place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our    competitors that have less debt; and           it may limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to    changes in our business. Environmental,    health and safety laws and regulations could adversely affect    our business.     Our facilities and operations are subject to numerous laws and    regulations relating to air emissions, wastewater discharges,    the handling of hazardous materials and wastes, manufacturing    and disposal of certain materials, and regulations otherwise    relating to health, safety and the protection of the    environment. Our products may also be governed by regulations in    the countries where they are sold. As a result, we may need to    devote management time or expend significant resources on    compliance, and we have incurred and will continue to incur    capital and other expenditures to comply with these regulations.    Any significant costs may have a material adverse impact on our    financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.    Further, these laws and regulations are constantly evolving and    it is impossible to predict accurately the effect they may have    upon our financial condition, results of operations or cash    flows. "
17,BRC,BRADY CORP,2006-10-06,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors Before making an investment decision with respect to our    stock, you should carefully consider the risks set forth below    and all other information contained in this report. If any of    the events contemplated by the following risks actually occur,    then our business, financial condition or results of operations    could be materially adversely affected. Market    demand for our products may be susceptible to fluctuations in    the economy that may cause volatility in our results of    operations.     Sales of our products may be susceptible to changes in general    economic conditions, namely general downturns in the regional    economies in which we compete. Our business in the MRO market    tends to vary with the nominal GDP of the local economies in    which we manufacture and sell. As a result, in periods of    economic contraction, our business may not grow or may decline.    In the OEM market, we have been adversely affected by reduced    demand for our products due to downturns in the global economy    as this is a more cyclical business than the MRO business. This    cyclicality can result in higher degrees of volatility in our    net sales and results of operations. These more volatile markets    include, but are not limited to, mobile telecommunication    devices, hard disk drives and electronics in personal computers    and personal digital assistants. Our    current and future success could be impacted by our ability to    effectively integrate acquired companies and manage our    growth.     Our growth has and will continue to place significant demands on    our management and operational and financial resources. Since    the beginning of fiscal year 2004, we have acquired    19 companies. These recent and future acquisitions will    require integration of sales and marketing, information    technology, finance and administrative operations and    information of the newly acquired business. The successful    integration of acquisitions will require substantial attention    from our management and the management of the acquired    businesses, which could decrease the time they have to serve and    attract customers. We cannot assure that we will be able to    successfully integrate these recent or any future acquisitions,    that these acquisitions will operate profitably or that we will    be able to achieve the financial or operational success expected    from the acquisitions. Furthermore, our rapid growth in recent    periods, our anticipated geographic expansion, and our planned    expansion through additional acquisitions present challenges to    maintain the internal control and disclosure control standards    applicable to public companies under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of    2002. Our financial condition, cash flows and operational    results could be adversely affected if we do not successfully    integrate the newly acquired businesses or if our other    businesses suffer on account of our increased focus on the newly    acquired businesses. If we    fail to develop new products or our customers do not accept the    new products we develop, our business could be affected    adversely.     Development of proprietary products is key to the success of our    core growth and our high gross margins now and in the future.

We continue to invest in the    development and marketing of new products. These expenditures do    not always result in products that will be accepted by the    market. Failure to develop successful new products may also    cause our customers to buy from a competitor or may cause us to    lower our prices in order to compete.

We may not be able to identify acquisition    targets or successfully complete acquisitions in the future due    to the absence of quality companies, economic conditions, or    price expectations from sellers. If we are unable to complete    additional acquisitions, our growth may be limited.    I-9Table of ContentsWe    operate in highly competitive niche markets within the OEM    market and may be forced to cut our prices or incur additional    costs to remain competitive, which may have a negative impact on    our profitability.     We face substantial competition, particularly in the OEM markets    we serve.

As a result of our    acquisition of Tradex Converting AB in May 2006, our largest    customer represents approximately 7% of our net sales. Our    dependence on these large customers makes our relationships with    these customers important to our business. We cannot assure you    that we will be able to maintain these relationships and retain    this business in the future.

The    loss of or reduction of business from one or more of these large    key customers could have a material adverse impact on our    financial condition and results of operations.    I-10Table of ContentsForeign    currency fluctuations could adversely affect our sales and    profits.     More than half of our revenues are derived outside of the United    States. As such, fluctuations in foreign currency can have an    adverse impact on our sales and profits as amounts that are    measured in foreign currency are translated back to    U.S. dollars. Any increase in the value of the    U.S. dollar in relation to the value of the local currency    will adversely affect our revenues from our foreign operations    when translated into U.S. dollars. Similarly, any decrease    in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the value of    the local currency will increase our development costs in our    foreign operations, to the extent such costs are payable in    foreign currency, when translated into U.S. dollars. During    fiscal year 2006, the strengthening U.S. dollar versus all    other currencies reduced sales by approximately    $3.7 million. We    depend on our key personnel and the loss of these personnel    could have an adverse effect on our operations.     Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued    services of our key executives, managers and other skilled    personnel.

If we    are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our    costs to do so increase significantly, our operations would be    materially adversely affected. We may    be unable to successfully implement anticipated changes to our    information technology system.     We are now in the process of upgrading certain portions of our    information technology. Part of this upgrade includes an    accelerated implementation of an SAP platform in our facilities    in China, Europe, Malaysia and Singapore. To date, we have    completed the implementation at one facility in China and in    India. We expect that this implementation of the SAP platform    will enable us to more effectively and efficiently manage our    supply chain and business processes. Our failure to successfully    manage this process or implement these upgrades as scheduled    could cause us to incur unexpected costs or to lose customers or    sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our    financial results. The    increase in our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our    financial health and make us vulnerable to adverse economic    conditions.     We have incurred indebtedness to finance acquisitions and for    other general corporate purposes.
