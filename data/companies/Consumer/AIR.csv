0,AIR,AAR CORP,2023-07-18,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSThe following is a description of the principal risks inherent in our business. Any of the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and should be considered in evaluating us. Although the risks are organized by heading, and each risk is described separately, many of the risks are interrelated. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the material risks affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be material that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations in the future.Risks Related to Our Business and IndustryWe are affected by factors that adversely impact the commercial aviation industry.As a provider of products and services to the commercial aviation industry, we are greatly affected by overall economic conditions of that industry. The commercial aviation industry is historically cyclical and has been negatively affected in the past by geopolitical events, conflicts and wars, weather related events, natural disasters, pandemics, disruption to fuel and oil production and supply shortages, high fuel and oil prices, environmental concerns (including climate change), lack of capital, cost inflation, and weak economic conditions. As a result of these and other events, from time to time certain of our customers have filed for bankruptcy protection or ceased operation. The impact of instability in the global financial markets may lead airlines to reduce domestic or international capacity. In addition, certain of our airline customers have in the past been impacted by tight credit markets, which limited their ability to buy parts, services, engines, and aircraft. 9Table of ContentsA reduction in the operating fleet of aircraft both in the U.S. and abroad will result in reduced demand for parts support and maintenance activities for the type of aircraft affected. A deteriorating airline environment may also result in our inability to fully collect outstanding accounts receivable, which we experienced during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021. Reduced demand from customers caused by weak economic conditions, including tight credit conditions and customer bankruptcies, may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.In addition, an increase in energy costs and the price of fuel to the airlines could result in additional pressure on the operating costs of airlines, who comprise our largest customers. The market for jet fuel is inherently volatile and is subject to, among other things, changes in government policy on jet fuel production, fluctuations in the global supply of crude oil and disruptions in oil production or delivery caused by hostility in oil-producing areas. Airlines are sometimes unable to pass on increases in fuel prices to customers by increasing fares due to the competitive nature of the airline industry, and this compounds the pressure on operating costs, and in turn, airlines’ ability to do business with us. In addition, our business depends on maintaining a sufficient supply of various products to meet our customers’ demands. If we were to lose a key supplier, or were unable to obtain the same levels of deliveries from these suppliers and were unable to supplement those purchases with products obtained from other suppliers, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, our key suppliers could also increase the pricing of their products, which would negatively affect our operating results if we were not able to pass these price increases through to our customers.Our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth rates have been and may continue to be adversely affected by these and other events that impact the aviation industry, including the following:●deterioration in the financial condition of our existing and potential customers;●reductions in the need for, or the deferral of, aircraft maintenance and repair services and spare parts support;●retirement of older generation aircraft, resulting in lower prices for spare parts and services for those aircraft;●reductions in demand for used aircraft and engines;●increased in-house maintenance by airlines;●lack of parts in the marketplace;●acts of terrorism;●economic sanctions;●inflationary pressures and conditions;●political, social and economic instability and disruptions;●cost of labor shortages and other changes in labor conditions;●future outbreaks of infectious diseases; and●acts of God.Pandemics and other disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, and similar public health threats that may arise in the future, may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.While commercial airline traffic recovered significantly from COVID-19 over the last two years, pandemics, disease outbreaks or similar public health threats, continues to pose a range of risks to our business. The emergence of new variants or diseases, developments in the public health situation, the reimposition of regional or global travel restrictions, and other pandemic-related complications could have a negative impact on our business. 10Table of ContentsReduced numbers of aircraft flying or flight hours negatively impacts the demand for our aftermarket parts support and maintenance services, and any prolonged reduction in the future could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and liquidity.From the COVID-19 pandemic, some businesses have expanded remote working opportunities and continued to restrict non-essential travel for their employees, which has kept demand for business air travel below pre-pandemic levels. Consumer behavior related to traveling may continue to be negatively impacted by adverse changes in business travel patterns or adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate, including declines in income levels and/or loss of wealth resulting from the impact from economic conditions.We are unable to predict the extent to which disease outbreaks or other public health threats that may arise in the future may change air travel, which could have a material impact on our business. The degree to which any future disease outbreaks or public health threats may impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity is uncertain and will depend on future developments.Our U.S. government contracts may not continue at present sales levels, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Our sales to branches, agencies and departments of the U.S. government and their contractors were $577.0 million (29.0% of consolidated sales) in fiscal 2023 (See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The majority of our U.S. government sales is for products and services supporting DoD aircraft sustainment and mobility strategy and DoS flight operations and are, therefore, subject to changes in defense and other governmental agency funding and spending. Our contracts with the U.S. government and their contractors are typically agreements to provide products and services at a fixed price and have a term of one year or less, frequently subject to extension for one or more additional periods of one year at the option of the government customer. Sales to agencies of the U.S. government and their contractors are subject to a number of factors, including the level of troop and personnel deployment worldwide, competitive bidding, U.S. government funding, requirements generated by world events, and budgetary constraints. For example, in conjunction with the U.S. exit from Afghanistan in fiscal 2022, we concluded our activities in country under our DoS and DoD contracts. U.S. government programs are subject to annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes. In recent years, U.S. government appropriations have been affected by larger U.S. government budgetary issues and related legislation, including the statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt. These issues could negatively affect the timely collection of our U.S. government invoices.Future congressional appropriation and authorization of defense spending and the application of sequestration remain marked by significant debate and an uncertain schedule. The federal debt limit continues to be actively debated as plans for long-term national fiscal policy are discussed. The outcome of these debates could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and programs we support in particular.If there are funding delays and constraints, we may be required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. government contracts even if the U.S. government is unable to make timely payments. Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, U.S. government programs budgets could be negatively impacted by possible policy changes on defense spending, spending priorities outside defense, reduction in military presence overseas and in general pressure to reduce U.S. defense spending. A significant reduction in defense spending could result in a reduction in the amount of our products and services furnished to the U.S. government.We use estimates when accounting for long-term contracts and face risks of cost overruns and losses on these contracts.We sell certain of our products and services to our commercial, government, and defense customers under firm contracts providing for fixed unit prices, regardless of costs incurred by us. The cost of providing products or services may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, overhead, and other unknown variants, including manufacturing and other operational 11Table of Contentsinefficiencies and differences between assumptions used by us to price a contract and actual results. Increased costs may result in cost overruns and losses on such contracts, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We recognize revenue on our long-term contracts primarily over time as there is continuous transfer of control to the customer over the duration of the contract as the services are delivered, which generally requires estimates of total costs at completion, fees earned on the contract, or both. This estimation process is complex and involves significant judgment related to assumptions on flight hours, component repair costs, labor hours and rates, and contract penalties and incentives. Adjustments to estimates are often required as work progresses, experience is gained and additional information becomes known, even though the scope of the work required under the contract may not change. Any adjustment as a result of a change in estimates is recognized as events become known. Changes in the underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates could result in adjustments that may adversely affect our future financial results.If our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their contractual obligations, our contract profitability and our ability to win new contracts may be adversely affected.We rely on subcontractors to perform a portion of the services we agree to provide our customers, and our suppliers provide necessary inventory and component parts. A failure by one or more of our subcontractors or suppliers to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed-upon services or supplies may affect our ability to perform our contractual obligations. Deficiencies in the performance of our subcontractors and/or suppliers could result in liquidated damages or our customer terminating our contract for default. A termination for default could expose us to liability and adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to win new contract awards.Success at our airframe maintenance facilities is dependent upon continued outsourcing by the airlines and our ability to maintain our operational footprint.We currently perform airframe maintenance, repair, and overhaul activities at six leased locations. If our maintenance facilities become unavailable either temporarily or permanently due to our inability to extend our leases on commercial reasonable terms, labor disruptions or circumstances beyond our control, such as geopolitical developments or logistical complications arising from acts of war, cyber-attacks, weather, global climate change, earthquakes or other natural disasters including public health crises, we may be unable to shift such work to other facilities or to make up for lost work. Revenues at these facilities fluctuate based on demand for maintenance which, in turn, is driven by the number of aircraft operating and the extent of outsourcing of maintenance activities by airlines. In addition, certain airlines operate certain new fleet types and/or newer generation aircraft and we may not have contractual arrangements to service these aircraft nor technicians trained and certified to perform the required airframe maintenance, repair, and overhaul activities. If either the number of aircraft operating or the level of outsourcing of maintenance activities declines, we may not be able to execute our operational and financial plans at our maintenance, repair, and overhaul facilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Our operations may be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled personnel or work stoppages.Our business has historically been dependent on educated and skilled aviation mechanics because of the complex nature of many of our products and services. We face competition for management and qualified technical personnel from other companies and organizations. Furthermore, we have a collective bargaining agreement covering approximately 200 employees in our Expeditionary Services segment (approximately 5% of our total workforce).Our ability to operate successfully and meet our customers’ demands could be jeopardized if we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled personnel, including aviation mechanics, to conduct our business, or we experience a significant or prolonged work stoppage in such an environment. In such case, our ability to secure new work and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. There is significant competition for such personnel in the industries in which we operate. We may be impacted by higher labor costs and/or labor shortages due to wage and salary inflationary pressures in the economy, a tightening labor market and increased rates of employee resignations generally throughout the U.S. economy.Employees in certain locations have shown increased interest in unionization. If a significant portion of our employees were to become unionized, our labor costs could increase and our business could be negatively affected by other requirements and expectations that could increase our costs, change our employee culture, decrease our flexibility and disrupt our business. Additionally, our responses to any union organizing efforts could negatively impact how we are perceived and have adverse effects on our business, including on our financial results. These responses could also expose us to legal risk, causing us to incur costs to defend legal and regulatory actions, potential penalties and restrictions or reputational harm.12Table of ContentsWe operate in highly competitive markets, and competitive pressures may adversely affect us.The markets for our products and services to our commercial, government, and defense customers are highly competitive, and we face competition from a number of sources, both domestic and international. Our competitors include aircraft manufacturers, aircraft component and parts manufacturers, airline and aircraft service companies, other companies providing maintenance, repair and overhaul services, other aircraft spare parts distributors and redistributors. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and others may price their products and services below our selling prices. These competitive markets also create pressure on our ability to hire and retain qualified technicians and other skilled labor needs. We believe that our ability to compete depends on superior customer service and support, on-time delivery, sufficient inventory availability, competitive pricing, and effective quality assurance programs.Our government customers, including the DoD and DoS, may turn to commercial contractors, rather than traditional defense contractors, for certain work, or may utilize set asides such as small business, women-owned, or minority-owned contractors or determine to source work internally rather than use us. We are also impacted by bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards and task orders. Bid protests could result in significant expense for us, contract modifications, or the award decision being overturned and loss of the contract award. Even where a bid protest does not result in the loss of an award, the resolution can extend the time until the contract activity can begin, and delay earnings. These competitive pressures, with potential impacts on both our commercial and government business, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We are exposed to risks associated with operating internationally.We conduct our business in a number of foreign countries, some of which are politically unstable or subject to military or civil conflicts. Consequently, we are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following:●military conflicts, civil strife, and political risks;●export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;●export controls and financial and economic sanctions imposed on certain industry sectors, including the aviation sector, and parties in Russia by the U.S., the U.K., the European Union and others;●compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, United Kingdom (“UK”) Bribery Act 2010, and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws; see Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about certain pending proceedings;●the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws, treaties, and technical standards and changes in those regulations;●contract award and funding delays;●potential restrictions on transfers of funds;●import and export duties and value added taxes;●foreign exchange risk;●transportation delays and interruptions;●uncertainties arising from foreign local business practices and cultural considerations; and●changes in U.S. policies on trade relations and trade policy, including implementation of or changes in trade sanctions, tariffs, and embargoes.Any measures adopted to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of doing business internationally, may not be adequate, and the regions in which we operate might not continue to be stable enough to allow us to operate profitably or at all.13Table of ContentsAcquisitions expose us to risks, including the risk that we may be unable to effectively integrate acquired businesses.We have completed acquisitions in the past and we have discussions with third parties regarding acquisitions on a regular basis. Acquisitions involve risks, including difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel, the effects of amortization of any acquired intangible assets and the potential impairment of goodwill, and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired business. In addition, acquisitions often require substantial management resources and have the potential to divert our attention from our existing business. For any businesses we may acquire in the future, we may not be able to execute our operational, financial, or integration plans for the acquired businesses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We may not realize the anticipated benefits of the Trax acquisition, and may face difficulties integrating Trax’s operations.We expect the acquisition of Trax, as a provider of comprehensive MRO and airline fleet management software, to expand our proprietary technology and digital portfolio and accelerate our strategy to offer digital solutions to our customers. However, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the Trax acquisition or our digital solutions strategy, including any synergies, cross-selling opportunities, cost savings or growth opportunities. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Further, we may not be able to execute our integration plans for Trax and may face diversion of management attention from our existing business, unanticipated costs and risks associated with expanding further into the digital solutions market. Failing to realize the anticipated benefits and difficulties integrating Trax could have a material adverse effect on business, operating results and financial condition.Market values for our aviation products fluctuate and we may be unable to recover our costs incurred on engines, rotable components and other aircraft parts.We make a number of assumptions when determining the recoverability of rotable components, engines, and other assets which are on lease, available for lease, or supporting our long-term programs. These assumptions include historical sales trends, current and expected usage trends, replacement values, current and expected lease rates, residual values, future demand, and future cash flows. Reductions in demand for these assets or declining market values, as well as differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining the recoverability of our aircraft, engines, and other assets, could result in impairment charges in future periods, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Our business could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats or other disruptions.Our business depends heavily on information technology and computerized systems to communicate and operate effectively. We store sensitive data including proprietary business information, intellectual property and confidential employee or other personal data on our servers and databases. Our systems and technologies, or those of third parties on which we rely, could fail or become unreliable due to equipment failures, software viruses, cyber threats, ransomware attacks, terrorist acts, natural disasters, power failures, political or social unrest, pandemics or other public health issues or other causes. These threats arise in some cases as a result of our role as a defense contractor.Cyber security threats are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to our sensitive information, business e-mail compromises, ransomware attacks, and other electronic security breaches, including at our customers, suppliers, subcontractors, and joint venture partners, that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption of data.14Table of ContentsA theft, loss, fraudulent use or misuse of customer, stockholder, employee or our proprietary data by cybercrime or otherwise, noncompliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in costs, fines, litigation or regulatory action against us. Security breaches can create system disruptions and shutdowns that could result in disruptions to our operations. We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities, new vulnerabilities or other developments will not compromise or breach the security solutions protecting our information technology, networks and systems. A failure of or cyber‐attack on our information systems technology or those of our partners, customers, vendors, or suppliers could adversely affect our ability to process orders, maintain proper levels of inventory, collect accounts receivable and pay expenses; all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Such serious harm can involve, among other things, misuse of our assets, business disruptions, loss of data, unauthorized access to trade secrets and confidential business information, unauthorized access to personal information, legal claims or proceedings, reporting errors, processing inefficiencies, negative media attention, reputational harm, loss of sales, remediation and increased insurance costs, and interference with regulatory compliance. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience some of these types of cybersecurity threats and incidents, which could be material in the future.The procedures and controls we utilize to monitor and mitigate these threats may not be sufficient to prevent security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, the costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results, and financial condition.Moreover, expenditures incurred in implementing and maintaining cyber security and other procedures and controls could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We may need to make significant capital expenditures to keep pace with technological developments in our industry.The industries in which we participate are constantly undergoing development and change, and it is likely that new products, equipment, and methods of repair and overhaul services will be introduced in the future. We may need to make significant expenditures to purchase new equipment and to train our employees to keep pace with any new technological developments. These expenditures could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Risks Related to Financial MattersWe may need to reduce the carrying value of our assets.We own and distribute a significant amount of engines, aircraft parts and components, as well as own manufacturing facilities and joint venture investments. Recurring losses in certain operations could require us to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of the related assets and recognize an impairment charge through earnings to reduce the carrying value. In addition, if aircraft or engines for which we offer replacement parts or supply repair and overhaul services are retired and there are fewer aircraft that require these parts or services, our revenues may decline.We make a number of assumptions when determining the recoverability of our assets, including historical sales trends, current and expected usage trends, replacement values, current and expected lease rates, residual values, future demand, and future cash flows. Differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining the recoverability of our assets could result in impairment charges in future periods, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions, including $122.3 million associated with our acquisition of Trax in fiscal 2023. If we are unable to achieve the projected levels of operating results, it may be necessary to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and related intangible assets. Similarly, if we were to lose a key customer or if a regulator were to terminate any of our repair certificates at our airframe maintenance or landing gear facilities, we might be required to record an impairment charge if we were unable to operate.We may not be able to fully execute our stock repurchase program and may not otherwise return capital to our stockholders in the foreseeable future.In 2021, we announced a stock repurchase program with authorization to repurchase up to $150 million of our common stock, of which $92.4 million has been repurchased under the program as of May 31, 2023. There is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares or value that will be repurchased under the stock repurchase program and we may discontinue purchases at any time. Whether 15Table of Contentswe make any further repurchases will depend on many factors, including but not limited to our business and financial performance, the business and market conditions at the time, including the price of our shares, and other factors that management considers relevant. Additionally, we expect to fund repurchases under our stock repurchase program through cash on hand, which may impact our ability to pursue potential strategic opportunities. Although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness and there can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value.Our credit agreement prohibits payment of a dividend or repurchase of our stock if a default exists under the agreement. In addition, we have not declared a dividend on our common stock since 2020, and there can be no assurance that we will do so in the foreseeable future. The declaration and payment of cash dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be dependent upon our future earnings, cash flows, financial condition, capital requirements and strategy and any future government restrictions. If we do not pay dividends or continue to execute on our stock repurchase program, investors will have to rely on the possibility of stock appreciation and sell their shares to realize a return on their investment.We are dependent upon continued availability of financing to manage our business and to execute our business strategy, and additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us.Our ability to manage our business and to execute our business strategy is dependent, in part, on the continued availability of debt and equity capital. Access to the debt and equity capital markets may be limited by various factors, including the condition of overall credit markets, general economic factors, interest rates, state of the aviation industry, our financial performance, and credit ratings. Debt and equity capital may not continue to be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Our existing debt includes restrictive and/or financial covenants.Certain financing arrangements, including our Revolving Credit Facility and our accounts receivable financing program, require us to comply with various restrictive covenants and some contain financial covenants that require us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests. Our failure to meet these covenants could result in default under these loan and debt agreements and may result in a cross-default under other debt agreements. In the event of a default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amounts outstanding under our debt agreements could be declared immediately due and payable. Our failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory MattersIf we fail to comply with government procurement laws and regulations, we could lose business and be liable for various penalties or sanctions.We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of government contracts. In the U.S., these laws and regulations include the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Truth in Negotiations Act, Cost Accounting Standards, and laws, regulations, and orders restricting the use and dissemination of classified information under the U.S. export control laws and the export of certain products and technical information and safeguarding of contractor information systems.In addition, we are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable under government contracts. U.S. government agencies routinely audit government contractors, including the Company, to review performance under contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of and compliance with internal control systems and policies, including the contractor’s purchasing, property, estimating, compensation and management information systems. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract are not reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must be refunded. Also, any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in payments being withheld, penalties and reduced future business.U.S. government rules allow contracting officers to impose contractual withholdings at no less than certain minimum levels if a contracting officer determines that one or more of a contractor’s business systems have one or more significant deficiencies. If a contracting officer were to impose such a withholding on us or even on a prime contractor where we are the subcontractor, it would 16Table of Contentsincrease the risk that we would not be paid in full or paid timely. If future audit adjustments exceed our estimates, our profitability could be adversely affected.If a government inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions, including contract termination, fines, forfeiture of fees, suspension of payment and suspension or debarment from doing business with government agencies, any of which could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to significant government regulation and may need to incur significant expenses to comply with new or more stringent governmental regulation.The aviation industry is highly regulated by the FAA in the U.S. and equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. Before we sell any of our products that are to be installed in an aircraft, such as engines, engine parts and components, and airframe and accessory parts and components, they must meet certain standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in certain other countries. We operate repair stations that are licensed by the FAA and the equivalent regulatory agencies in certain other countries, and hold certificates to operate aircraft. Specific regulations vary from country to country; although regulatory requirements in other countries are generally satisfied by compliance with FAA requirements. New and more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted in the future that, if enacted, may have an adverse impact on us.If any of our material licenses, certificates, authorizations, or approvals were revoked or suspended by the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.Our industry is susceptible to product and other liability claims, and claims not adequately covered by insurance may adversely affect our financial condition.Our business exposes us to possible claims for property damage and bodily injury or death, which may result if an engine, engine part or component, airframe part or accessory, or any other aviation product that we have sold, manufactured, or repaired fails, or if an aircraft we operated, serviced, or in which our products are installed, has an accident. Claims may arise in the future, and our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us in all circumstances. Additionally, we might not be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Any liability claim not covered by adequate insurance could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We could be negatively impacted by stakeholder and market focus on Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) matters.There has been an increasing focus on corporate ESG practices and disclosures over the past few years, and expectations in this area are rapidly evolving. The criteria used to evaluate ESG practices may continue to evolve, which could result in greater expectations and may cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy new criteria and abide by any new disclosure requirements. The increasing attention to sustainability could also result in reduced demand for certain of our products and/or reduced profits. If we are unable to respond effectively, investors may conclude that our ESG policies and/or actions are inadequate and decide not to invest in our stock. If we are perceived to have failed to achieve our ESG initiatives or accurately disclose our progress on such matters, our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.We must comply with extensive environmental requirements, and any exposure to environmental liabilities may adversely affect us.Federal, state, and local requirements relating to the discharge and emission of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes, the remediation and abatement of contaminants, and other activities affecting the environment have had and may continue to have an impact on our operations. Management cannot assess the possible effect of compliance with future environmental requirements or of future environmental claims for which we may not have adequate indemnification or insurance coverage. If we were required to pay the expenses related to any future environmental claims for which neither indemnification nor insurance coverage were available, these expenses could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.17Table of ContentsFuture environmental regulatory developments in the United States and abroad concerning environmental issues, such as climate change, could adversely affect our operations and increase operating costs and, through their impact on our customers, reduce demand for our products and services. Actions may be taken in the future by the U.S. government, state governments within the United States, foreign governments, or the International Civil Aviation Organization to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry. The precise nature of any such requirements and their applicability to us and our customers are difficult to predict, but the impact to us and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant, including the potential for increased fuel costs, carbon taxes or fees, or a requirement to purchase carbon credits.​"
4,AIR,AAR CORP,2022-07-21,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSThe following is a description of the principal risks inherent in our business. Any of the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and should be considered in evaluating us. Although the risks are organized by heading, and each risk is described separately, many of the risks are interrelated. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the material risks affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be material that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations in the future.Risks Related to Our Business and IndustryWe are affected by factors that adversely impact the commercial aviation industry.As a provider of products and services to the commercial aviation industry, we are greatly affected by overall economic conditions of that industry. The commercial aviation industry is historically cyclical and has been negatively affected in the past by geopolitical events, conflicts and wars, weather related events, natural disasters, pandemics, disruption to fuel and oil production and supply shortages, high fuel and oil prices, environmental concerns (including climate change), lack of capital, cost inflation, and weak economic conditions. As a result of these and other events, from time to time certain of our customers have filed for bankruptcy protection or ceased operation. The impact of instability in the global financial markets may lead airlines to reduce domestic or international capacity. In addition, certain of our airline customers have in the past been impacted by tight credit markets, which limited their ability to buy parts, services, engines, and aircraft. A reduction in the operating fleet of aircraft both in the U.S. and abroad will result in reduced demand for parts support and maintenance activities for the type of aircraft affected. A deteriorating airline environment may also result in additional airline bankruptcies, and in such circumstances we may not be able to fully collect outstanding accounts receivable, which was recently seen over the past two years during the COVID-19 pandemic. Reduced demand from customers caused by weak economic conditions, including tight credit conditions and customer bankruptcies, may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.In addition, an increase in energy costs and the price of fuel to the airlines could result in additional pressure on the operating costs of airlines, who comprise our largest customers. The market for jet fuel is inherently volatile and is subject to, among other things, changes in government policy on jet fuel production, fluctuations in the global supply of crude oil and disruptions in oil production or delivery caused by hostility in oil-producing areas. Airlines are sometimes unable to pass on increases in fuel prices to customers by increasing fares due to the competitive nature of the airline industry, and this compounds the pressure on operating costs, and in turn, airlines’ ability to do business with us.  In addition, our business depends on maintaining a sufficient supply of various products to meet our customers’ demands.  If we were to lose a key supplier, or were unable to obtain the same levels of deliveries from these suppliers and were unable to supplement those purchases with products obtained from other suppliers, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Additionally, our key suppliers could also increase the pricing of their products, which would negatively affect our operating results if we were not able to pass these price increases through to our customers.8Table of ContentsOur business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth rates have been and may continue to be adversely affected by these and other events that impact the aviation industry, including the following:●deterioration in the financial condition of our existing and potential customers;●reductions in the need for, or the deferral of, aircraft maintenance and repair services and spare parts support;●retirement of older generation aircraft, resulting in lower prices for spare parts and services for those aircraft;●reductions in demand for used aircraft and engines;●increased in-house maintenance by airlines;●lack of parts in the marketplace;●acts of terrorism;●economic sanctions;●inflationary pressures;●political, social and economic instability and disruptions;●cost of labor shortages and other changes in labor conditions;●future outbreaks of infectious diseases; and●acts of God.Our U.S. government contracts may not continue at present sales levels, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Our sales to branches, agencies and departments of the U.S. government and their contractors were $620.0 million (34.1% of consolidated sales) in fiscal 2022 (See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The majority of our U.S. government sales is for products and services supporting DoD aircraft sustainment and mobility strategy and DoS flight operations and are, therefore, subject to changes in defense and other governmental agency funding and spending. Our contracts with the U.S. government and their contractors are typically agreements to provide products and services at a fixed price and have a term of one year or less, frequently subject to extension for one or more additional periods of one year at the option of the government customer. Sales to agencies of the U.S. government and their contractors are subject to a number of factors, including the level of troop and personnel deployment worldwide, competitive bidding, U.S. government funding, requirements generated by world events, and budgetary constraints. For example, in conjunction with the U.S. exit from Afghanistan in fiscal 2022, we concluded our activities in country under our WASS and U.S. Department of Defense contracts.U.S. government programs are subject to annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes.  In recent years, U.S. government appropriations have been affected by larger U.S. government budgetary issues and related legislation, including the statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt. These issues could negatively affect the timely collection of our U.S. government invoices.Future congressional appropriation and authorization of defense spending and the application of sequestration remain marked by significant debate and an uncertain schedule. The federal debt limit continues to be actively debated as plans for long-term national fiscal policy are discussed. The outcome of these debates could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and programs we support in particular.9Table of ContentsIf there are funding delays and constraints, we may be required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. government contracts even if the U.S. government is unable to make timely payments.  Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, U.S. government programs budgets could be negatively impacted under President Biden’s administration, including possible policy changes on defense spending, spending priorities outside defense, reduction in military presence overseas and in general pressure to reduce U.S. defense spending. A significant reduction in defense spending could result in a reduction in the amount of our products and services furnished to the U.S. government.In light of COVID-19, the percentage of our revenue that comes from government contracts increased and became more important to our overall business, which heightens the possible adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition of any reduction in the sales levels of our U.S. government contracts.We use estimates when accounting for long-term contracts and face risks of cost overruns and losses on these contracts.We sell certain of our products and services to our commercial, government, and defense customers under firm contracts providing for fixed unit prices, regardless of costs incurred by us. The cost of providing products or services may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, overhead, and other unknown variants, including manufacturing and other operational inefficiencies and differences between assumptions used by us to price a contract and actual results.  Increased costs may result in cost overruns and losses on such contracts, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We recognize revenue on our long-term contracts primarily over time as there is continuous transfer of control to the customer over the duration of the contract as the services are delivered, which generally requires estimates of total costs at completion, fees earned on the contract, or both. This estimation process is complex and involves significant judgment related to assumptions on flight hours, component repair costs, labor hours and rates, and contract penalties and incentives.  Adjustments to estimates are often required as work progresses, experience is gained and additional information becomes known, even though the scope of the work required under the contract may not change. Any adjustment as a result of a change in estimate is recognized as events become known. Changes in the underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates could result in adjustments that may adversely affect our future financial results.If our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their contractual obligations, our contract profitability and our ability to win new contracts may be adversely affected.We rely on subcontractors to perform a portion of the services we agree to provide our customers, and our suppliers provide necessary inventory and component parts. A failure by one or more of our subcontractors or suppliers to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed-upon services or supplies may affect our ability to perform our contractual obligations.  Deficiencies in the performance of our subcontractors and/or suppliers could result in liquidated damages or our customer terminating our contract for default. A termination for default could expose us to liability and adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to win new contract awards.Success at our airframe maintenance facilities is dependent upon continued outsourcing by the airlines.We currently perform airframe maintenance, repair, and overhaul activities at six leased locations. If our maintenance facilities become unavailable either temporarily or permanently due to labor disruptions or circumstances beyond our control, such as geopolitical developments or logistical complications arising from acts of war, cyber-attacks, weather, global climate change, earthquakes or other natural disasters including public health crises, we may be unable to shift such work to other facilities or to make up for lost work.  Revenues at these facilities fluctuate based on demand for maintenance which, in turn, is driven by the number of aircraft operating and the extent of outsourcing of maintenance activities by airlines. In addition, certain airlines operate certain new fleet types and/or newer generation aircraft and we may not have contractual arrangements to service these aircraft nor technicians trained and certified to perform the required airframe maintenance, repair, and overhaul activities. If either the number of aircraft operating or the level of outsourcing of maintenance activities declines, we may not be able to execute our operational and financial plans at our maintenance, repair, and overhaul facilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.10Table of ContentsOur operations would be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled personnel or work stoppages.Our business has historically been dependent on educated and skilled aviation mechanics because of the complex nature of many of our products and services. We face competition for management and qualified technical personnel from other companies and organizations. Furthermore, we have a collective bargaining agreement covering approximately 200 employees (5% of employees) in our Expeditionary Services segment.Our ability to operate successfully and meet our customers’ demands could be jeopardized if we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled personnel, including aviation mechanics, to conduct our business, or we experience a significant or prolonged work stoppage in such an environment, our ability to secure new work and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. There is significant competition for such personnel in the industries in which we operate. We may be impacted by higher labor costs and/or labor shortages due to wage and salary inflationary pressures in the economy, a tightening labor market and increased rates of employee resignations generally throughout the U.S. economy.We operate in highly competitive markets, and competitive pressures may adversely affect us.The markets for our products and services to our commercial, government, and defense customers are highly competitive, and we face competition from a number of sources, both domestic and international.  Our competitors include aircraft manufacturers, aircraft component and parts manufacturers, airline and aircraft service companies, other companies providing maintenance, repair and overhaul services, other aircraft spare parts distributors and redistributors.  Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and others may price their products and services below our selling prices.  These competitive markets also create pressure on our ability to hire and retain qualified technicians and other skilled labor needs.  We believe that our ability to compete depends on superior customer service and support, on-time delivery, sufficient inventory availability, competitive pricing, and effective quality assurance programs.Our government customers, including the DoD and DoS, may turn to commercial contractors, rather than traditional defense contractors, for certain work, or may utilize set asides such as small business, women-owned, or minority-owned contractors or determine to source work internally rather than use us.  We are also impacted by bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards and task orders.  Bid protests could result in significant expense for us, contract modifications, or the award decision being overturned and loss of the contract award. Even where a bid protest does not result in the loss of an award, the resolution can extend the time until the contract activity can begin, and delay earnings.  These competitive pressures, with potential impacts on both our commercial and government business, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We are exposed to risks associated with operating internationally.We conduct our business in a number of foreign countries, some of which are politically unstable or subject to military or civil conflicts. Consequently, we are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following:●military conflicts, civil strife, and political risks;●export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;●export controls and financial and economic sanctions imposed on certain industry sectors, including the aviation sector, and parties in Russia by the U.S., the U.K., the European Union and others;●compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, United Kingdom (“UK”) Bribery Act 2010, and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws; see Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about certain pending proceedings;●the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws, treaties, and technical standards and changes in those regulations;●contract award and funding delays;●potential restrictions on transfers of funds;11Table of Contents●import and export duties and value added taxes;●foreign exchange risk;●transportation delays and interruptions, including those related to COVID-19 travel restrictions;●uncertainties arising from foreign local business practices and cultural considerations; and●changes in U.S. policies on trade relations and trade policy, including implementation of or changes in trade sanctions, tariffs, and embargoes.Any measures adopted to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of doing business internationally, may not be adequate, and the regions in which we operate might not continue to be stable enough to allow us to operate profitably or at all.Acquisitions expose us to risks, including the risk that we may be unable to effectively integrate acquired businesses.We have completed acquisitions in the past and we have discussions with third parties regarding acquisitions on a regular basis.  Acquisitions involve risks, including difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel, the effects of amortization of any acquired intangible assets and the potential impairment of goodwill, and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired business. In addition, acquisitions often require substantial management resources and have the potential to divert our attention from our existing business.  For any businesses we may acquire in the future, we may not be able to execute our operational, financial, or integration plans for the acquired businesses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Market values for our aviation products fluctuate and we may be unable to recover our costs incurred on engines, rotable components and other aircraft parts.We make a number of assumptions when determining the recoverability of rotable components, engines, and other assets which are on lease, available for lease, or supporting our long-term programs. These assumptions include historical sales trends, current and expected usage trends, replacement values, current and expected lease rates, residual values, future demand, and future cash flows. Reductions in demand for these assets or declining market values, as well as differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining the recoverability of our aircraft, engines, and other assets, could result in impairment charges in future periods, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Our business could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats or other disruptions.Our business depends heavily on information technology and computerized systems to communicate and operate effectively. We store sensitive data including proprietary business information, intellectual property and confidential employee or other personal data on our servers and databases. Our systems and technologies, or those of third parties on which we rely, could fail or become unreliable due to equipment failures, software viruses, cyber threats, ransomware attacks, terrorist acts, natural disasters, power failures, political or social unrest, pandemics or other public health issues or other causes. These threats arise in some cases as a result of our role as a defense contractor.Cyber security threats are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to our sensitive information, business e-mail compromises, ransomware attacks, and other electronic security breaches, including at our customers, suppliers, subcontractors, and joint venture partners, that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption of data.12Table of ContentsA theft, loss, fraudulent use or misuse of customer, stockholder, employee or our proprietary data by cybercrime or otherwise, noncompliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in costs, fines, litigation or regulatory action against us. Security breaches can create system disruptions and shutdowns that could result in disruptions to our operations. We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities, new vulnerabilities or other developments will not compromise or breach the security solutions protecting our information technology, networks and systems. A failure of or cyber‐attack on our information systems technology or those of our partners, customers, vendors, or suppliers could adversely affect our ability to process orders, maintain proper levels of inventory, collect accounts receivable and pay expenses; all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Such serious harm can involve, among other things, misuse of our assets, business disruptions, loss of data, unauthorized access to trade secrets and confidential business information, unauthorized access to personal information, legal claims or proceedings, reporting errors, processing inefficiencies, negative media attention, reputational harm, loss of sales, remediation and increased insurance costs, and interference with regulatory compliance. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience some of these types of cybersecurity threats and incidents, which could be material in the future.The procedures and controls we utilize to monitor and mitigate these threats may not be sufficient to prevent security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, the costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results, and financial condition.Moreover, expenditures incurred in implementing and maintaining cyber security and other procedures and controls could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We may need to make significant capital expenditures to keep pace with technological developments in our industry.The industries in which we participate are constantly undergoing development and change, and it is likely that new products, equipment, and methods of repair and overhaul services will be introduced in the future. We may need to make significant expenditures to purchase new equipment and to train our employees to keep pace with any new technological developments. These expenditures could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Risk Related to Financial MattersWe may need to reduce the carrying value of our assets.We own and distribute a significant amount of engines, aircraft parts and components, as well as own manufacturing facilities and joint venture investments. Recurring losses in certain operations could require us to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of the related assets and recognize an impairment charge through earnings to reduce the carrying value. During fiscal 2020, we recognized impairment charges of $11.8 million related to our COCO business which is classified as a discontinued operation. In addition, we recognized impairment charges over the last three years of $2.6 million related to our Malaysian joint venture. In addition, if aircraft or engines for which we offer replacement parts or supply repair and overhaul services are retired and there are fewer aircraft that require these parts or services, our revenues may decline.We make a number of assumptions when determining the recoverability of our assets, including historical sales trends, current and expected usage trends, replacement values, current and expected lease rates, residual values, future demand, and future cash flows. Differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining the recoverability of our assets could result in impairment charges in future periods, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions. If we are unable to achieve the projected levels of operating results, it may be necessary to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and related intangible assets. Similarly, if we were to lose a key customer or if a regulator were to terminate any of our repair certificates at our airframe maintenance or landing gear facilities, we might be required to record an impairment charge if we were unable to operate.13Table of ContentsWe may not be able to fully execute our stock repurchase program and may not otherwise return capital to our stockholders in the foreseeable future.In 2021, we announced a stock repurchase program in which we may repurchase up to $150 million of our common stock. There is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares or value that will be repurchased under the stock repurchase program and we may discontinue purchases at any time. Whether we make any further repurchases will depend on many factors, including but not limited to our business and financial performance, the business and market conditions at the time, including the price of our shares, and other factors that management considers relevant. Additionally, we expect to fund repurchases under our stock repurchase program through cash on hand, which may impact our ability to pursue potential strategic opportunities. Although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness and there can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value.Our credit agreement prohibits payment of a dividend or repurchase of our stock if a default exists under the agreement. In addition, we have not declared a dividend on our common stock since 2020, and there can be no assurance that we will do so in the foreseeable future. If we do not pay dividends or continue to execute on our stock repurchase program, investors will have to rely on the possibility of stock appreciation and sell their shares to realize a return on their investment.We are dependent upon continued availability of financing to manage our business and to execute our business strategy, and additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us.Our ability to manage our business and to execute our business strategy is dependent, in part, on the continued availability of debt and equity capital. Access to the debt and equity capital markets may be limited by various factors, including the condition of overall credit markets, general economic factors, state of the aviation industry, our financial performance, and credit ratings. Debt and equity capital may not continue to be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.LIBOR, the London interbank offered rate, is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. Interest rates under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) are based partly on LIBOR. On March 5, 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it would cease publication of all tenors of LIBOR immediately after June 30, 2023. Additionally, the Federal Reserve Board has advised banks to stop entering into new U.S. dollar LIBOR based contracts.  The U.S. Federal Reserve has begun publishing a Secured Overnight Funding Rate which is currently intended to serve as an alternative reference rate to LIBOR. If lenders have increased costs due to changes in LIBOR, we may suffer from potential increases in interest rates on our borrowings. We may in the future pursue amendments to our LIBOR-based debt transactions to provide for a transaction mechanism or other reference rate in anticipation of LIBOR’s discontinuation, but we may not be able to reach agreement with our lenders on any such amendments.Our existing debt includes restrictive and/or financial covenants.Certain financing arrangements, including our Revolving Credit Facility and our accounts receivable financing program, require us to comply with various restrictive covenants and some contain financial covenants that require us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests.  Our failure to meet these covenants could result in default under these loan and debt agreements and may result in a cross-default under other debt agreements. In the event of a default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amounts outstanding under our debt agreements could be declared immediately due and payable. Our failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.14Table of ContentsRisks Related to COVID-19The COVID-19 pandemic has had a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity, and the duration and extent of the pandemic is uncertain.The COVID-19 pandemic prompted governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response that have included international and domestic travel restrictions or advisories, restrictions on business operations, limitations on public gatherings, social distancing recommendations, temporary closures of businesses, remote work arrangements, closures of tourist destinations and attractions as well as quarantine and shelter-in-place orders.  Even in the absence of formal restrictions and prohibitions, contagious illness and fear of contagion adversely affected travel demand and travel behavior although passenger airline traffic has been improving recently.With the roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccines, many countries have started to lift their states of emergency and restrictions on air travel.  With the easing of these restrictions, passenger airline traffic has started to pick-up in the United States, but business travel in particular remains well below pre-pandemic levels. In addition, we have seen and expect to continue to see reduced demand in our non-cargo commercial businesses in certain markets. In some cases, airlines have reduced their operating fleet of aircraft both in the U.S. and abroad which results in reduced demand for parts support and maintenance activities for the type of aircraft affected. Moreover, if the COVID-19 pandemic continues to result in decreased worldwide commercial activity, it could also adversely affect the demand for airline cargo services. Reduced numbers of aircraft flying or flight hours has and will continue to negatively impact the demand for our services, and any prolonged reduction could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and liquidity.As the situation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic remains fluid, the pandemic has continued to negatively impact travel demand and our business.  It remains difficult to reasonably predict the full extent of the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our longer-term operational and financial performance, which will depend on a number of future developments, many of which are outside our control, such as the ultimate duration of and factors impacting the recovery from the pandemic including the introduction and spread of new variants of the virus that may be resistant to currently approved vaccines or treatment options and the continuation of existing or implementation of new government travel restrictions.In addition, we source parts and components for our business from various suppliers around the world. Disruptions to our supply chain and business operations, or to our suppliers’ or customers’ supply chains and business operations, could have adverse effects on our ability to provide aftermarket support and services. Moreover, a prolonged epidemic or pandemic, or the threat thereof, could result in worker absences, lower productivity, voluntary closure of our offices and facilities, travel restrictions for our employees and other disruptions to our business. These impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory MattersIf we fail to comply with government procurement laws and regulations, we could lose business and be liable for various penalties or sanctions.We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of government contracts. In the U.S., these laws and regulations include the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Truth in Negotiations Act, Cost Accounting Standards, and laws, regulations, and orders restricting the use and dissemination of classified information under the U.S. export control laws and the export of certain products and technical information and safeguarding of contractor information systems.In addition, we are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable under government contracts. U.S. government agencies routinely audit government contractors, including the Company, to review performance under contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of and compliance with internal control systems and policies, including the contractor’s purchasing, property, estimating, compensation and management information systems. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract are not reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must be refunded. Also, any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in payments being withheld, penalties and reduced future business.15Table of ContentsU.S. government rules allow contracting officers to impose contractual withholdings at no less than certain minimum levels if a contracting officer determines that one or more of a contractor’s business systems have one or more significant deficiencies. If a contracting officer were to impose such a withholding on us or even one of our prime contractors, it would increase the risk that we would not be paid in full or paid timely. If future audit adjustments exceed our estimates, our profitability could be adversely affected.If a government inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions, including contract termination, fines, forfeiture of fees, suspension of payment and suspension or debarment from doing business with government agencies, any of which could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about certain pending proceedings.We are subject to significant government regulation and may need to incur significant expenses to comply with new or more stringent governmental regulation.The aviation industry is highly regulated by the FAA in the United States and equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. Before we sell any of our products that are to be installed in an aircraft, such as engines, engine parts and components, and airframe and accessory parts and components, they must meet certain standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in certain other countries. We operate repair stations that are licensed by the FAA and the equivalent regulatory agencies in certain other countries, and hold certificates to operate aircraft. Specific regulations vary from country to country; although regulatory requirements in other countries are generally satisfied by compliance with FAA requirements. New and more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted in the future that, if enacted, may have an adverse impact on us.If any of our material licenses, certificates, authorizations, or approvals were revoked or suspended by the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.Our industry is susceptible to product and other liability claims, and claims not adequately covered by insurance may adversely affect our financial condition.Our business exposes us to possible claims for property damage and bodily injury or death, which may result if an engine, engine part or component, airframe part or accessory, or any other aviation product that we have sold, manufactured, or repaired fails, or if an aircraft we operated, serviced, or in which our products are installed, has an accident. Claims may arise in the future, and our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us in all circumstances. Additionally, we might not be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Any liability claim not covered by adequate insurance could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We could be negatively impacted by stakeholder and market focus on Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) matters.There has been an increasing focus on corporate ESG practices and disclosures over the past few years, and expectations in this area are rapidly evolving. The criteria used to evaluate ESG practices may continue to evolve, which could result in greater expectations and may cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy new criteria. The increasing attention to sustainability could also result in reduced demand for certain of our products and/or reduced profits. If we are unable to respond effectively, investors may conclude that our ESG policies and/or actions are inadequate. If we are perceived to have failed to achieve our ESG initiatives or accurately disclose our progress on such matters, our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.We must comply with extensive environmental requirements, and any exposure to environmental liabilities may adversely affect us.Federal, state, and local requirements relating to the discharge and emission of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes, the remediation and abatement of contaminants, and other activities affecting the environment have had and may continue to have an impact on our operations. Management cannot assess the possible effect of compliance with future environmental requirements or of future environmental claims for which we may not have adequate indemnification or insurance coverage. If we were required to pay the expenses related to any future environmental claims for which neither indemnification nor insurance coverage were available, these expenses could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.16Table of ContentsFuture environmental regulatory developments in the United States and abroad concerning environmental issues, such as climate change, could adversely affect our operations and increase operating costs and, through their impact on our customers, reduce demand for our products and services. Actions may be taken in the future by the U.S. government, state governments within the United States, foreign governments, or the International Civil Aviation Organization to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry. The precise nature of any such requirements and their applicability to us and our customers are difficult to predict, but the impact to us and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant, including the potential for increased fuel costs, carbon taxes or fees, or a requirement to purchase carbon credits.​"
9,AIR,AAR CORP,2021-07-21,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSThe following is a description of the principal risks inherent in our business. Any of the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and should be considered in evaluating us. Although the risks are organized by heading, and each risk is described separately, many of the risks are interrelated. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the material risks affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be material that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations in the future.Risks Related to Our Business and IndustryWe are affected by factors that adversely impact the commercial aviation industry.As a provider of products and services to the commercial aviation industry, we are greatly affected by overall economic conditions of that industry. The commercial aviation industry is historically cyclical and has been negatively affected in the past by geopolitical events and conflicts, weather related events, natural disasters, disruption to fuel and oil production and supply shortages, high fuel and oil prices, environmental concerns (including climate change), lack of capital, and weak economic conditions. As a result of these and other events, from time to time certain of our customers have filed for bankruptcy protection or ceased operation. The impact of instability in the global financial markets may lead airlines to reduce domestic or international capacity. In addition, certain of our airline customers have in the past been impacted by tight credit markets, which limited their ability to buy parts, services, engines, and aircraft. A reduction in the operating fleet of aircraft both in the U.S. and abroad will result in reduced demand for parts support and maintenance activities for the type of aircraft affected. A deteriorating airline environment may also result in additional airline bankruptcies, and in such circumstances we may not be able to fully collect outstanding accounts receivable, which was recently seen over the past year during the COVID-19 pandemic. Reduced demand from customers caused by weak economic conditions, including tight credit conditions and customer bankruptcies, may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations. As an example, over the past year, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduced demand, our revenue decreased by 20% largely due to reduced demand attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth rates have been and may continue to be adversely affected by these and other events that impact the aviation industry, including the following:●deterioration in the financial condition of our existing and potential customers;●reductions in the need for, or the deferral of, aircraft maintenance and repair services and spare parts support;●retirement of older generation aircraft, resulting in lower prices for spare parts and services for those aircraft;●reductions in demand for used aircraft and engines;●increased in-house maintenance by airlines;●lack of parts in the marketplace;●acts of terrorism;●future outbreaks of infectious diseases; and●acts of God.8Table of ContentsOur U.S. government contracts may not continue at present sales levels, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Our sales to branches, agencies and departments of the U.S. government and their contractors were $738.8 million (44.7% of consolidated sales) in fiscal 2021 (See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The majority of our U.S. government sales is for products and services supporting DoD logistics and mobility strategy and DoS flight operations and are, therefore, subject to changes in defense and other governmental agency funding and spending. Our contracts with the U.S. government and their contractors are typically agreements to provide products and services at a fixed price and have a term of one year or less, frequently subject to extension for one or more additional periods of one year at the option of the government customer. Sales to agencies of the U.S. government and their contractors are subject to a number of factors, including the level of troop deployment worldwide, competitive bidding, U.S. government funding, requirements generated by world events, and budgetary constraints. U.S. government programs are subject to annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes.  In recent years, U.S. government appropriations have been affected by larger U.S. government budgetary issues and related legislation, including the statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt. These issues could negatively affect the timely collection of our U.S. government invoices.Future congressional appropriation and authorization of defense spending and the application of sequestration remain marked by significant debate and an uncertain schedule. The federal debt limit continues to be actively debated as plans for long-term national fiscal policy are discussed. The outcome of these debates could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and programs we support in particular.If there are funding delays and constraints, we may be required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. government contracts even if the U.S. government is unable to make timely payments.  Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, U.S. government programs budgets could be negatively impacted under President Biden’s administration, including possible policy changes on defense spending, spending priorities outside defense, reduction in military presence overseas and in general pressure to reduce U.S. defense spending. A significant reduction in defense spending could result in a reduction in the amount of our products and services furnished to the U.S. government.In light of COVID-19, and the corresponding decrease in commercial airline activity, the percentage of our revenue that comes from government contracts increased and became more important to our overall business, which heightens the possible adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition of any reduction in the sales levels of our U.S. government contracts.We use estimates when accounting for long-term contracts and face risks of cost overruns and losses on these contracts.We sell certain of our products and services to our commercial, government, and defense customers under firm contracts providing for fixed unit prices, regardless of costs incurred by us.  The cost of producing products or providing services may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, overhead, and other unknown variants, including manufacturing and other operational inefficiencies and differences between assumptions used by us to price a contract and actual results.  Increased costs may result in cost overruns and losses on such contracts, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We recognize revenue on our long-term contracts primarily over time as there is continuous transfer of control to the customer over the duration of the contract as the services are delivered, which generally requires estimates of total costs at completion, fees earned on the contract, or both. This estimation process is complex and involves significant judgment related to assumptions on flight hours, component repair costs, labor hours and rates, and contract penalties and incentives.  Adjustments to estimates are often required as work progresses, experience is gained and additional information becomes known, even though the scope of the work required under the contract may not change. Any adjustment as a result of a change in estimate is recognized as events become known. Changes in the underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates could result in adjustments that may adversely affect our future financial results.9Table of ContentsIf our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their contractual obligations, our contract profitability and our ability to win new contracts may be adversely affected.We rely on subcontractors to perform a portion of the services we agree to provide our customers, and our suppliers provide necessary inventory and component parts. A failure by one or more of our subcontractors or suppliers to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed-upon services or supplies may affect our ability to perform our contractual obligations.  Deficiencies in the performance of our subcontractors and/or suppliers could result in liquidated damages or our customer terminating our contract for default. A termination for default could expose us to liability and adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to win new contract awards.Success at our airframe maintenance facilities is dependent upon continued outsourcing by the airlines.We currently perform airframe maintenance, repair, and overhaul activities at six leased locations. If our maintenance facilities become unavailable either temporarily or permanently due to labor disruptions or circumstances beyond our control, such as geopolitical developments or logistical complications arising from acts of war, cyber-attacks, weather, global climate change, earthquakes or other natural disasters including public health crises, we may be unable to shift such work to other facilities or to make up for lost work.  Revenues at these facilities fluctuate based on demand for maintenance which, in turn, is driven by the number of aircraft operating and the extent of outsourcing of maintenance activities by airlines. In addition, certain airlines operate certain new fleet types and/or newer generation aircraft and we may not have contractual arrangements to service these aircraft nor technicians trained and certified to perform the required airframe maintenance, repair, and overhaul activities. If either the number of aircraft operating or the level of outsourcing of maintenance activities declines, we may not be able to execute our operational and financial plans at our maintenance, repair, and overhaul facilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Our operations would be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled personnel or work stoppages.Our business has historically been dependent on educated and skilled aviation mechanics because of the complex nature of many of our products and services. We face competition for management and qualified technical personnel from other companies and organizations. Furthermore, we have a collective bargaining agreement covering approximately 200 employees (4% of employees).  Beginning in April 2020, we furloughed a significant portion of our skilled workforce as a result of the negative impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the demand for our services, with those employees being either terminated or brought back to work by November 16, 2020.  Although we took measures to maintain good relationships with our workforce, there can be no assurance that the act of furloughing our employees did not damage employee relations or negatively impact our ability to be an employer of choice in our field. As the demand for skilled personnel begins to return to pre-COVID-19 levels, if we are unable to quickly reassemble our skilled workforce and subsequently retain a sufficient number of skilled personnel, or we experience a significant or prolonged work stoppage in such an environment, our ability to secure new work and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.We operate in highly competitive markets, and competitive pressures may adversely affect us.The markets for our products and services to our commercial, government, and defense customers are highly competitive, and we face competition from a number of sources, both domestic and international.  Our competitors include aircraft manufacturers, aircraft component and parts manufacturers, airline and aircraft service companies, other companies providing maintenance, repair and overhaul services, other aircraft spare parts distributors and redistributors.  Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and others may price their products and services below our selling prices.  These competitive markets also create pressure on our ability to hire and retain qualified technicians and other skilled labor needs.  We believe that our ability to compete depends on superior customer service and support, on-time delivery, sufficient inventory availability, competitive pricing, and effective quality assurance programs.Our government customers, including the DoD and DoS, may turn to commercial contractors, rather than traditional defense contractors, for certain work, or may utilize set asides such as small business, women-owned, or minority-owned contractors or determine to source work internally rather than use us.  We are also impacted by bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards and task orders.  Bid protests could result in significant expense for us, contract modifications, or the award decision being overturned and loss of the contract award. Even where a bid protest does not result in the loss of an award, the resolution can extend the time until the contract activity can begin, and delay earnings.  These competitive pressures, with potential impacts on both our commercial and government business, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.10Table of ContentsWe are exposed to risks associated with operating internationally.We conduct our business in a number of foreign countries, some of which are politically unstable or subject to military or civil conflicts.  Consequently, we are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following:●military conflicts, civil strife, and political risks;●export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;●compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, United Kingdom (“UK”) Bribery Act 2010, and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws; see Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about certain pending proceedings;●the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws, treaties, and technical standards and changes in those regulations;●contract award and funding delays;●potential restrictions on transfers of funds;●import and export duties and value added taxes;●foreign exchange risk;●transportation delays and interruptions, including the inability to move personnel out of foreign jurisdictions due to COVID-19 travel restrictions;●uncertainties arising from foreign local business practices and cultural considerations; and●changes in U.S. policies on trade relations and trade policy, including implementation of or changes in trade sanctions, tariffs, and embargoes.Any measures adopted to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of doing business internationally, may not be adequate, and the regions in which we operate might not continue to be stable enough to allow us to operate profitably or at all.Acquisitions expose us to risks, including the risk that we may be unable to effectively integrate acquired businesses.We have completed acquisitions in the past and we have discussions with third parties regarding acquisitions on a regular basis.  Acquisitions involve risks, including difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel, the effects of amortization of any acquired intangible assets and the potential impairment of goodwill, and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired business. In addition, acquisitions often require substantial management resources and have the potential to divert our attention from our existing business.  For any businesses we may acquire in the future, we may not be able to execute our operational, financial, or integration plans for the acquired businesses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Market values for our aviation products fluctuate and we may be unable to recover our costs incurred on engines, rotable components and other aircraft parts.We make a number of assumptions when determining the recoverability of rotable components, engines, and other assets which are on lease, available for lease, or supporting our long-term programs. These assumptions include historical sales trends, current and expected usage trends, replacement values, current and expected lease rates, residual values, future demand, and future cash flows.  Reductions in demand for these assets or declining market values, as well as differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining the recoverability of our aircraft, engines, and other assets, could result in impairment charges in future periods, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.11Table of ContentsOur business could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats or other disruptions.Our business depends heavily on information technology and computerized systems to communicate and operate effectively. We store sensitive data including proprietary business information, intellectual property and confidential employee or other personal data on our servers and databases. Our systems and technologies, or those of third parties on which we rely, could fail or become unreliable due to equipment failures, software viruses, cyber threats, ransomware attacks, terrorist acts, natural disasters, power failures, political or social unrest, pandemics or other public health issues or other causes. These threats arise in some cases as a result of our role as a defense contractor.Cyber security threats are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to our sensitive information, business e-mail compromises, ransomware attacks, and other electronic security breaches, including at our customers, suppliers, subcontractors, and joint venture partners, that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption of data.A theft, loss, fraudulent use or misuse of customer, stockholder, employee or our proprietary data by cybercrime or otherwise, noncompliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in costs, fines, litigation or regulatory action against us. Security breaches can create system disruptions and shutdowns that could result in disruptions to our operations. We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities, new vulnerabilities or other developments will not compromise or breach the security solutions protecting our information technology, networks and systems. A failure of or cyber‐attack on our information systems technology or those of our partners, customers, vendors, or suppliers could adversely affect our ability to process orders, maintain proper levels of inventory, collect accounts receivable and pay expenses; all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Such serious harm can involve, among other things, misuse of our assets, business disruptions, loss of data, unauthorized access to trade secrets and confidential business information, unauthorized access to personal information, legal claims or proceedings, reporting errors, processing inefficiencies, negative media attention, reputational harm, loss of sales, remediation and increased insurance costs, and interference with regulatory compliance. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience some of these types of cybersecurity threats and incidents, which could be material in the future.The procedures and controls we utilize to monitor and mitigate these threats may not be sufficient to prevent security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, the costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results, and financial condition.Moreover, expenditures incurred in implementing and maintaining cyber security and other procedures and controls could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We may need to make significant capital expenditures to keep pace with technological developments in our industry.The industries in which we participate are constantly undergoing development and change, and it is likely that new products, equipment, and methods of repair and overhaul services will be introduced in the future. We may need to make significant expenditures to purchase new equipment and to train our employees to keep pace with any new technological developments. These expenditures could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.12Table of ContentsRisk Related to Financial MattersWe may need to reduce the carrying value of our assets.We own and distribute a significant amount of engines, aircraft parts and components, as well as own manufacturing facilities and joint venture investments. Recurring losses in certain operations could require us to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of the related assets and recognize an impairment charge through earnings to reduce the carrying value. During fiscal 2020, and 2019, we recognized impairment charges of $11.8 million and $74.1 million, respectively, related to our COCO business which is classified as a discontinued operation. In addition, if aircraft or engines for which we offer replacement parts or supply repair and overhaul services are retired and there are fewer aircraft that require these parts or services, our revenues may decline.We make a number of assumptions when determining the recoverability of our assets, including historical sales trends, current and expected usage trends, replacement values, current and expected lease rates, residual values, future demand, and future cash flows.  Differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining the recoverability of our assets could result in impairment charges in future periods, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions. If we are unable to achieve the projected levels of operating results, it may be necessary to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and related intangible assets. Similarly, if we were to lose a key customer or if a regulator were to terminate any of our repair certificates at our airframe maintenance or landing gear facilities, we might be required to record an impairment charge if we were unable to operate.We are dependent upon continued availability of financing to manage our business and to execute our business strategy, and additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us.Our ability to manage our business and to execute our business strategy is dependent, in part, on the continued availability of debt and equity capital. Access to the debt and equity capital markets may be limited by various factors, including the condition of overall credit markets, general economic factors, state of the aviation industry, our financial performance, and credit ratings. Debt and equity capital may not continue to be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.LIBOR, the London interbank offered rate, is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. Interest rates under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) are based partly on LIBOR. On March 5, 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it would cease publication of the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR immediately after December 31, 2021 and cease publication of the remaining tenors immediately after June 30, 2023. Additionally, the Federal Reserve Board has advised banks to stop entering into new U.S. dollar LIBOR based contracts.  The U.S. Federal Reserve has begun publishing a Secured Overnight Funding Rate which is currently intended to serve as an alternative reference rate to LIBOR. If lenders have increased costs due to changes in LIBOR, we may suffer from potential increases in interest rates on our borrowings. Further, we may need to renegotiate our credit facilities or any other borrowings that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established.Our existing debt and expected government funding includes restrictive and/or financial covenants.Certain financing arrangements, including our Revolving Credit Facility and our accounts receivable financing program, require us to comply with various restrictive covenants and some contain financial covenants that require us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests.  Our failure to meet these covenants could result in default under these loan and debt agreements and may result in a cross-default under other debt agreements. In the event of a default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amounts outstanding under our debt agreements could be declared immediately due and payable. Our failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.13Table of ContentsIn addition, our receipt of funding from the Payroll Support Program under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) requires us to comply with certain covenants. If we do not comply with these covenants, or if the government issues new guidance regarding existing covenants, the government may require us to repay the support given to us.We currently are prohibited from paying dividends under the Payroll Support Program under the CARES Act and, in the future, may not be able to pay or maintain dividends, or we may choose not to pay dividends, and the failure to pay or maintain dividends may adversely affect our share price.The Payroll Support Program under the CARES Act prohibits the Company from paying dividends to our stockholders through September 30, 2021, accordingly no dividend has been paid since April 2020 or will be paid by the Company prior to September 30 of this year.After the restrictions on paying dividends under the CARES Act lapse, our ability to pay, maintain or increase cash dividends to our stockholders is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including: our ability to comply with financial covenants, the economic condition of the commercial aviation industry, the level and timing of capital expenditures, principal repayments and other capital needs, maintaining our credit ratings, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and legal restrictions on the payment of dividends, including government imposed restrictions. In the future, we may choose to not pay dividends or may not be able to pay dividends, maintain our historical level of dividends, or increase them over time. The failure to maintain or pay dividends may adversely affect our share price.Risks Related to COVID-19The COVID-19 pandemic has had a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity, and the duration and extent of the pandemic could prolong or increase the adverse impact.In December 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, China, and in March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. Many countries, including the United States, declared states of emergency and took steps to restrict air travel, and many companies adopted policies prohibiting non-essential business travel by their employees. Even in the absence of formal restrictions and prohibitions, contagious illness and fear of contagion has adversely affected travel demand and travel behavior. Passenger airline traffic declined significantly since March 2020, and the decrease has since had a material negative impact on our financial results.With the roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccines, many countries have started to lift their states of emergency and restrictions on air travel.  With the easing of these restrictions, passenger airline traffic has started to pick-up in the United States, but business travel in particular remains well below pre-pandemic levels. In addition, we have seen and expect to continue to see reduced demand in our non-cargo commercial businesses in certain markets. In some cases, airlines have reduced their operating fleet of aircraft both in the U.S. and abroad which results in reduced demand for parts support and maintenance activities for the type of aircraft affected. Moreover, if the COVID-19 pandemic continues to result in decreased worldwide commercial activity, it could also adversely affect the demand for airline cargo services. Reduced numbers of aircraft flying or flight hours has and will continue to negatively impact the demand for our services, and any prolonged reduction could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and liquidity.While some of our employees were able to work remotely during spikes in COVID-19 cases, a significant number can only perform their job functions on site.  We have promulgated policies designed to provide for appropriate protections for employees in light of relevant government guidance. We evaluate and modify these policies as needed on an ongoing basis, but there remains the risk of disruption or reduced efficiency caused by social distancing and other protective measures as well as elevated employee absence because of illness or required quarantines.In addition, we source parts and components for our business from various suppliers around the world. Disruptions to our supply chain and business operations, or to our suppliers’ or customers’ supply chains and business operations, could have adverse effects on our ability to provide aftermarket support and services. Moreover, a prolonged epidemic or pandemic, or the threat thereof, could result in worker absences, lower productivity, voluntary closure of our offices and facilities, travel restrictions for our employees and other disruptions to our business. These impacts have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.14Table of ContentsWe have taken a number of actions in response to decreased demand. In addition to reducing operating expenditures for fiscal 2021, we received financial assistance under the CARES Act. Certain of our subsidiaries received $57.2 million from the U.S. Treasury Department (“Treasury”) through the Payroll Support Program under the CARES Act. In connection with the financial assistance these subsidiaries received under the Payroll Support Program, we are required to comply with certain provisions of the CARES Act, including provisions prohibiting the repurchase of common stock and the payment of common stock dividends through September 30, 2021; and limitations on the payment of certain employee compensation through March 24, 2022. These restrictions have and may continue to materially affect our operations, and we may not be successful in managing these impacts for the duration of the restrictions. In particular, limitations on compensation may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain senior management or attract other key employees during this critical time.Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory MattersIf we fail to comply with government procurement laws and regulations, we could lose business and be liable for various penalties or sanctions.We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of government contracts. In the U.S., these laws and regulations include the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Truth in Negotiations Act, Cost Accounting Standards, and laws, regulations, and orders restricting the use and dissemination of classified information under the U.S. export control laws and the export of certain products and technical information and safeguarding of contractor information systems.In addition, we are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable under government contracts. U.S. government agencies routinely audit government contractors, including the Company, to review performance under contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of and compliance with internal control systems and policies, including the contractor’s purchasing, property, estimating, compensation and management information systems. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract are not reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must be refunded. Also, any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in payments being withheld, penalties and reduced future business.U.S. government rules allow contracting officers to impose contractual withholdings at no less than certain minimum levels if a contracting officer determines that one or more of a contractor’s business systems have one or more significant deficiencies. If a contracting officer were to impose such a withholding on us or even one of our prime contractors, it would increase the risk that we would not be paid in full or paid timely. If future audit adjustments exceed our estimates, our profitability could be adversely affected.If a government inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions, including contract termination, fines, forfeiture of fees, suspension of payment and suspension or debarment from doing business with government agencies, any of which could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about certain pending proceedings.We are subject to significant government regulation and may need to incur significant expenses to comply with new or more stringent governmental regulation.The aviation industry is highly regulated by the FAA in the United States and equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. Before we sell any of our products that are to be installed in an aircraft, such as engines, engine parts and components, and airframe and accessory parts and components, they must meet certain standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in certain other countries. We operate repair stations that are licensed by the FAA and the equivalent regulatory agencies in certain other countries, and hold certificates to operate aircraft. Specific regulations vary from country to country; although regulatory requirements in other countries are generally satisfied by compliance with FAA requirements. New and more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted in the future that, if enacted, may have an adverse impact on us.If any of our material licenses, certificates, authorizations, or approvals were revoked or suspended by the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.15Table of ContentsOur industry is susceptible to product and other liability claims, and claims not adequately covered by insurance may adversely affect our financial condition.Our business exposes us to possible claims for property damage and bodily injury or death, which may result if an engine, engine part or component, airframe part or accessory, or any other aviation product that we have sold, manufactured, or repaired fails, or if an aircraft we operated, serviced, or in which our products are installed, has an accident. Claims may arise in the future, and our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us in all circumstances. Additionally, we might not be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Any liability claim not covered by adequate insurance could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We must comply with extensive environmental requirements, and any exposure to environmental liabilities may adversely affect us.Federal, state, and local requirements relating to the discharge and emission of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes, the remediation and abatement of contaminants, and other activities affecting the environment have had and may continue to have an impact on our operations. Management cannot assess the possible effect of compliance with future environmental requirements or of future environmental claims for which we may not have adequate indemnification or insurance coverage. If we were required to pay the expenses related to any future environmental claims for which neither indemnification nor insurance coverage were available, these expenses could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.Future environmental regulatory developments in the United States and abroad concerning environmental issues, such as climate change, could adversely affect our operations and increase operating costs and, through their impact on our customers, reduce demand for our products and services. Actions may be taken in the future by the U.S. government, state governments within the United States, foreign governments, or the International Civil Aviation Organization to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry. The precise nature of any such requirements and their applicability to us and our customers are difficult to predict, but the impact to us and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant, including the potential for increased fuel costs, carbon taxes or fees, or a requirement to purchase carbon credits.​"
12,AIR,AAR CORP,2020-07-21,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSThe following is a description of the principal risks inherent in our business.We are affected by factors that adversely impact the commercial aviation industry.As a provider of products and services to the commercial aviation industry, we are greatly affected by overall economic conditions of that industry. The commercial aviation industry is historically cyclical and has been negatively affected in the past by geopolitical events, high fuel and oil prices, lack of capital, and weak economic conditions. As a result of these and other events, from time to time certain of our customers have filed for bankruptcy protection or ceased operation.  The impact of instability in the global financial markets may lead airlines to reduce domestic or international capacity.  In addition, certain of our airline customers have in the past been impacted by tight credit markets, which limited their ability to buy parts, services, engines, and aircraft.A reduction in the operating fleet of aircraft both in the U.S. and abroad will result in reduced demand for parts support and maintenance activities for the type of aircraft affected. A deteriorating airline environment may also result in additional airline bankruptcies, and in such circumstances we may not be able to fully collect outstanding accounts receivable.  Reduced demand from customers caused by weak economic conditions, including tight credit conditions and customer bankruptcies, may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.Our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth rates may be adversely affected by these and other events that impact the aviation industry, including the following:●deterioration in the financial condition of our existing and potential customers;●reductions in the need for, or the deferral of, aircraft maintenance and repair services and spare parts support;●retirement of older generation aircraft, resulting in lower prices for spare parts and services for those aircraft;●reductions in demand for used aircraft and engines;●increased in-house maintenance by airlines;●lack of parts in the marketplace;●acts of terrorism;●future outbreaks of infectious diseases; and●acts of God.The coronavirus pandemic has had a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, operating results, financial condition, and liquidity, and the duration and extent of the pandemic could prolong or increase the adverse impact.In December 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, China, and in March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic.  Many countries, including the United States, have declared states of emergency and taken steps to restrict air travel, and many companies have adopted policies prohibiting non-essential business travel by their employees.  Even in the absence of formal restrictions and prohibitions, contagious illness and fear of contagion has adversely affected travel demand and travel behavior.  Passenger airline traffic has declined significantly since March 2020, and the decrease had a material negative impact on the financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.  We expect to continue to see reduced demand in our non-cargo commercial businesses.  Moreover, if the COVID-19 pandemic continues to result in decreased worldwide commercial activity, it could also adversely affect the demand for airline cargo services.  Reduced numbers of aircraft flying or flight hours negatively impacts the demand for our services, and any prolonged reduction could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and liquidity.7Table of ContentsIn addition, we source parts and components for our business from various suppliers around the world. Disruptions to our supply chain and business operations, or to our suppliers’ or customers’ supply chains and business operations, could have adverse effects on our ability to provide aftermarket support and services. Moreover, a prolonged epidemic or pandemic, or the threat thereof, could result in worker absences, lower productivity, voluntary closure of our offices and facilities, travel restrictions for our employees and other disruptions to our business. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.The Company has taken a number of actions in response to decreased demand. In addition to reducing operating expenditures for fiscal 2021 (including by implementing furloughs, eliminating certain employee and contractor positions, temporarily reducing senior employee and director compensation, consolidating facilities and eliminating non-essential spending), we have taken steps to improve our liquidity, including drawing down our Revolving Credit Facility and seeking financial assistance under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”).  Certain subsidiaries of the Company have been approved to receive $57.2 million from the U.S. Treasury Department (“Treasury”) through the Payroll Support Program under the CARES Act. In connection with the financial assistance these subsidiaries expect to receive under the Payroll Support Program, they will be required to comply with certain provisions of the CARES Act, including the requirement that funds provided pursuant to the Payroll Support Program be used exclusively for the continuation of payment of employee wages, salaries and benefits; the requirement against involuntary terminations and furloughs and reductions in employee pay rates and benefits  from the signing date of the Payroll Support Program agreement through September 30, 2020. In addition, those subsidiaries and the Company would be subject to provisions prohibiting the repurchase of common stock and the payment of common stock dividends through September 30, 2021; and limitations on the payment of certain employee compensation through March 24, 2022. These restrictions will materially affect the Company’s operations, and the Company may not be successful in managing these impacts for the duration of the restrictions. In particular, limitations on compensation may adversely impact the Company's ability to attract and retain senior management or attract other key employees during this critical time.  Although the Company has submitted what it believes to be final CARES Act documents to Treasury for counter signature, we can provide no assurance as to the final timing, terms or receipt of any funds.In addition, we cannot predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on our customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners, and each of their financial conditions; however, any material effect on these parties could adversely impact us.  The impact of COVID-19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this “Risk Factors
” section, any of which could have a material effect on us.Our U.S. government contracts may not continue at present sales levels, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Our sales to branches, agencies and departments of the U.S. government and their contractors were $668.2 million (32.2% of consolidated sales) in fiscal 2020 (See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).  The majority of our U.S. government sales is for products and services supporting DoD logistics and mobility strategy and DoS flight operations and are, therefore, subject to changes in defense and other governmental agency funding and spending.  Our contracts with the U.S. government and their contractors are typically agreements to provide products and services at a fixed price and have a term of one year or less, frequently subject to extension for one or more additional periods of one year at the option of the government customer. Sales to agencies of the U.S. government and their contractors are subject to a number of factors, including the level of troop deployment worldwide, competitive bidding, U.S. government funding, requirements generated by world events, and budgetary constraints.U.S. government programs are subject to annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes.  In recent years, U.S. government appropriations have been affected by larger U.S. government budgetary issues and related legislation, including the statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt. These issues could negatively affect the timely collection of our U.S. government invoices.Future congressional appropriation and authorization of defense spending and the application of sequestration remain marked by significant debate and an uncertain schedule. The federal debt limit continues to be actively debated as plans for long-term national fiscal policy are discussed. The outcome of these debates could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and programs we support in particular.8Table of ContentsIf there are funding delays and constraints, we may be required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. government contracts even if the U.S. government is unable to make timely payments.  Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.In light of COVID-19, and the corresponding decrease in commercial airline activity, we anticipate that the percentage of our revenue that comes from government contracts will increase and become more important to our overall business, which would heighten the adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition of any reduction in the sales levels of our U.S. government contracts.If we fail to comply with government procurement laws and regulations, we could lose business and be liable for various penalties or sanctions.We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of government contracts. In the U.S., these laws and regulations include the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Truth in Negotiations Act, Cost Accounting Standards, and laws, regulations, and orders restricting the use and dissemination of classified information under the U.S. export control laws and the export of certain products and technical information and safeguarding of contractor information systems.In addition, we are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable under government contracts. U.S. government agencies routinely audit government contractors to review performance under contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of and compliance with internal control systems and policies, including the contractor’s purchasing, property, estimating, compensation and management information systems. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract are not reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must be refunded. Also, any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in payments being withheld, penalties and reduced future business.U.S. government rules allow contracting officers to impose contractual withholdings at no less than certain minimum levels if a contracting officer determines that one or more of a contractor’s business systems have one or more significant deficiencies. If a contracting officer were to impose such a withholding on us or even one of our prime contractors, it would increase the risk that we would not be paid in full or paid timely. If future audit adjustments exceed our estimates, our profitability could be adversely affected.If a government inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions, including contract termination, fines, forfeiture of fees, suspension of payment and suspension or debarment from doing business with government agencies, any of which could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about certain pending proceedings.We use estimates when accounting for long-term contracts and face risks of cost overruns and losses on these contracts.We sell certain of our products and services to our commercial, government, and defense customers under firm contracts providing for fixed unit prices, regardless of costs incurred by us.  The cost of producing products or providing services may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, overhead, and other unknown variants, including manufacturing and other operational inefficiencies and differences between assumptions used by us to price a contract and actual results.  Increased costs may result in cost overruns and losses on such contracts, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We recognize revenue on our long-term contracts primarily over time as there is continuous transfer of control to the customer over the duration of the contract as the services are delivered, which generally requires estimates of total costs at completion, fees earned on the contract, or both. This estimation process is complex and involves significant judgment related to assumptions on flight hours, component repair costs, labor hours and rates, and contract penalties and incentives.  Adjustments to estimates are often required as work progresses, experience is gained and additional information becomes known, even though the scope of the work required under the contract may not change. Any adjustment as a result of a change in estimate is recognized as events become known. Changes in the underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates could result in adjustments that may adversely affect our future financial results.9Table of ContentsIf our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their contractual obligations, our contract profitability and our ability to win new contracts may be adversely affected.We rely on subcontractors to perform a portion of the services we agree to provide our customers, and our suppliers provide necessary inventory and component parts. A failure by one or more of our subcontractors or suppliers to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed-upon services or supplies may affect our ability to perform our contractual obligations.  Deficiencies in the performance of our subcontractors and/or suppliers could result in liquidated damages or our customer terminating our contract for default. A termination for default could expose us to liability and adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to win new contract awards.We are subject to significant government regulation and may need to incur significant expenses to comply with new or more stringent governmental regulation.The aviation industry is highly regulated by the FAA in the United States and equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. Before we sell any of our products that are to be installed in an aircraft, such as engines, engine parts and components, and airframe and accessory parts and components, they must meet certain standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in certain other countries. We operate repair stations that are licensed by the FAA and the equivalent regulatory agencies in certain other countries, and hold certificates to operate aircraft. Specific regulations vary from country to country; although regulatory requirements in other countries are generally satisfied by compliance with FAA requirements. New and more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted in the future that, if enacted, may have an adverse impact on us.If any of our material licenses, certificates, authorizations, or approvals were revoked or suspended by the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.Success at our airframe maintenance facilities is dependent upon continued outsourcing by the airlines.We currently perform airframe maintenance, repair, and overhaul activities at six leased locations.  Revenues at these facilities fluctuate based on demand for maintenance which, in turn, is driven by the number of aircraft operating and the extent of outsourcing of maintenance activities by airlines.  In addition, certain airlines operate certain new fleet types and/or newer generation aircraft and we may not have contractual arrangements to service these aircraft nor technicians trained and certified to perform the required airframe maintenance, repair, and overhaul activities.  If either the number of aircraft operating or the level of outsourcing of maintenance activities declines, we may not be able to execute our operational and financial plans at our maintenance, repair, and overhaul facilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Our operations would be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled personnel or work stoppages.Our business has historically been dependent on educated and skilled aviation mechanics because of the complex nature of many of our products and services. Furthermore, we have a collective bargaining agreement covering approximately 200 employees. Beginning in April 2020, we furloughed a significant portion of our skilled workforce as a result of the negative impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the demand for our services. Although we are taking measures to maintain good relationships with our workforce, including by paying the employer and employee portion of the furloughed employees’ health insurance costs, there can be no assurance that the act of furloughing our employees will not damage employee relations or cause employees to seek work elsewhere. Should the demand for skilled personnel return to pre-COVID-19 levels, and if we are unable to quickly reassemble our skilled workforce and subsequently retain a sufficient number of skilled personnel, or we experience a significant or prolonged work stoppage in such an environment, our ability to secure new work and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.We operate in highly competitive markets, and competitive pressures may adversely affect us.The markets for our products and services to our commercial, government, and defense customers are highly competitive, and we face competition from a number of sources, both domestic and international.  Our competitors include aircraft manufacturers, aircraft component and parts manufacturers, airline and aircraft service companies, other companies providing maintenance, repair and overhaul services, other aircraft spare parts distributors and redistributors.  Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and others may price their products and services below our selling prices.  These competitive markets also create pressure on our ability to hire and retain qualified technicians and other skilled labor needs.  We believe that our ability to compete depends on superior customer service and support, on-time delivery, sufficient inventory availability, competitive pricing, and effective quality assurance programs.10Table of ContentsOur government customers, including the DoD and DoS, may turn to commercial contractors, rather than traditional defense contractors, for certain work, or may utilize set asides such as small business, women-owned, or minority-owned contractors or determine to source work internally rather than use us.  We are also impacted by bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards and task orders.  Bid protests could result in significant expense for us, contract modifications, or the award decision being overturned and loss of the contract award. Even where a bid protest does not result in the loss of an award, the resolution can extend the time until the contract activity can begin, and delay earnings.  These competitive pressures, with potential impacts on both our commercial and government business, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We are exposed to risks associated with operating internationally.We conduct our business in a number of foreign countries, some of which are politically unstable or subject to military or civil conflicts.  Consequently, we are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following:●military conflicts, civil strife, and political risks;●export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;●compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, United Kingdom (“UK”) Bribery Act 2010, and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws; see Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about certain pending proceedings;●the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws, treaties, and technical standards and changes in those regulations;●contract award and funding delays;●potential restrictions on transfers of funds;●import and export duties and value added taxes;●foreign exchange risk;●transportation delays and interruptions, including the inability to move personnel out of foreign jurisdictions due to COVID-19 travel restrictions;●uncertainties arising from foreign local business practices and cultural considerations; and●changes in U.S. policies on trade relations and trade policy, including implementation of or changes in trade sanctions, tariffs, and embargoes.On January 31, 2020, the UK officially exited the European Union (“EU”) and entered a transition period during which it remains bound by EU rules and trade policy. There is significant uncertainty regarding the terms and the future relationship between the UK and the EU following the transition period. Potential adverse consequences of the UK’s exit include global market uncertainty, volatility in currency exchange rates, greater restrictions on imports and exports between the UK and other countries and increased regulatory complexities.While we have adopted and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of doing business internationally, such measures may not be adequate, and the regions in which we operate might not continue to be stable enough to allow us to operate profitably or at all.11Table of ContentsAcquisitions expose us to risks, including the risk that we may be unable to effectively integrate acquired businesses.We have completed acquisitions in the past few years and we have discussions with third parties regarding acquisitions on a regular basis.  Acquisitions involve risks, including difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel, the effects of amortization of any acquired intangible assets and the potential impairment of goodwill, and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired business. In addition, acquisitions often require substantial management resources and have the potential to divert our attention from our existing business.  For any businesses we may acquire in the future, we may not be able to execute our operational, financial, or integration plans for the acquired businesses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Market values for our aviation products fluctuate and we may be unable to recover our costs incurred on engines, rotable components and other aircraft parts.We make a number of assumptions when determining the recoverability of rotable components, engines, and other assets which are on lease, available for lease, or supporting our long-term programs. These assumptions include historical sales trends, current and expected usage trends, replacement values, current and expected lease rates, residual values, future demand, and future cash flows.  Reductions in demand for these assets or declining market values, as well as differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining the recoverability of our aircraft, engines, and other assets, could result in impairment charges in future periods, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We may need to reduce the carrying value of our assets.We own and distribute a significant amount of engines, aircraft parts and components, as well as own manufacturing facilities and joint venture investments.  Recurring losses in certain operations could require us to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of the related assets and recognize an impairment charge through earnings to reduce the carrying value.  During fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, we recognized impairment charges of $11.8 million, $74.1 million, and $54.2 million, respectively, related to our COCO business which is classified as a discontinued operation.  In addition, if aircraft or engines for which we offer replacement parts or supply repair and overhaul services are retired and there are fewer aircraft that require these parts or services, our revenues may decline. We recognized impairment charges of $11.0 million in fiscal 2020 related to the exit of certain product lines across our operations.We make a number of assumptions when determining the recoverability of our assets, including historical sales trends, current and expected usage trends, replacement values, current and expected lease rates, residual values, future demand, and future cash flows.  Differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining the recoverability of our assets could result in impairment charges in future periods, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions.  If we are unable to achieve the projected levels of operating results, it may be necessary to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and related intangible assets. During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $9.8 million related to our COCO business.  Similarly, if we were to lose a key customer or if a regulator were to terminate any of our repair certificates at our airframe maintenance or landing gear facilities, we might be required to record an impairment charge if we were unable to operate.We are dependent upon continued availability of financing to manage our business and to execute our business strategy, and additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us.Our ability to manage our business and to execute our business strategy is dependent, in part, on the continued availability of debt and equity capital. Access to the debt and equity capital markets may be limited by various factors, including the condition of overall credit markets, general economic factors, state of the aviation industry, our financial performance, and credit ratings. Debt and equity capital may not continue to be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.12Table of ContentsLIBOR, the London interbank offered rate, is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. Interest rates under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) are based partly on LIBOR. LIBOR is currently expected to phase out by the end of 2021. It is unclear if at that time LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve has begun publishing a Secured Overnight Funding Rate which is currently intended to serve as an alternative reference rate to LIBOR.  If the method for calculation of LIBOR changes, if LIBOR is no longer available or if lenders have increased costs due to changes in LIBOR, we may suffer from potential increases in interest rates on our borrowings. Further, we may need to renegotiate our credit facilities or any other borrowings that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established.Our existing debt and expected government funding includes restrictive and/or financial covenants.Certain financing arrangements, including our Revolving Credit Facility and our accounts receivable financing program, require us to comply with various restrictive covenants and some contain financial covenants that require us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests.  Our failure to meet these covenants could result in default under these loan and debt agreements and may result in a cross-default under other debt agreements. In the event of a default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amounts outstanding under our debt agreements could be declared immediately due and payable. Our failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, our expected receipt of funding under Payroll Support Program under the CARES Act would require us to comply with certain covenants. If we do not comply with these covenants, the government may require us to repay the support given to us.We may not be able to pay or maintain dividends, or we may choose not to pay dividends, and the failure to pay or maintain dividends may adversely affect our share price.On March 17, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.075 per share, or an aggregate of $2.6 million, which was paid on April 9, 2020 to holders of record on March 30, 2020.  This dividend may not be indicative of the amount of any future quarterly dividends.  Specifically, the Payroll Support Program under the CARES Act prohibits the Company from paying stock dividends through September 30, 2021, accordingly no dividend will be paid by the Company prior to that time assuming the receipt of funding.After the restrictions on paying the dividend under the CARES Act lapse, our ability to pay, maintain or increase cash dividends to our stockholders is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including: our ability to comply with financial covenants, the economic condition of the commercial aviation industry, the level and timing of capital expenditures, principal repayments and other capital needs, maintaining our credit ratings, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and legal restrictions on the payment of dividends, including government imposed restrictions.  In the future, we may choose to not pay dividends or may not be able to pay dividends, maintain our current level of dividends, or increase them over time. The failure to maintain or pay dividends may adversely affect our share price.Our industry is susceptible to product and other liability claims, and claims not adequately covered by insurance may adversely affect our financial condition.Our business exposes us to possible claims for property damage and bodily injury or death, which may result if an engine, engine part or component, airframe part or accessory, or any other aviation product that we have sold, manufactured, or repaired fails, or if an aircraft we operated, serviced, or in which our products are installed, has an accident.  We carry substantial liability insurance in amounts that we believe are adequate for our risk exposure and commensurate with industry norms. However, claims may arise in the future, and our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us in all circumstances. Additionally, we might not be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Any liability claim not covered by adequate insurance could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.13Table of ContentsOur business could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats or other disruptions.Our business depends heavily on information technology and computerized systems to communicate and operate effectively. The Company's systems and technologies, or those of third parties on which we rely, could fail or become unreliable due to equipment failures, software viruses, cyber threats, ransomware attacks, terrorist acts, natural disasters, power failures or other causes.  These threats arise in some cases as a result of our role as a defense contractor.Cyber security threats are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to our sensitive information, business e-mail compromises, ransomware attacks, and other electronic security breaches, including at our customers, suppliers, subcontractors, and joint venture partners, that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption of data.The procedures and controls we utilize to monitor and mitigate these threats may not be sufficient to prevent security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, the costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results, and financial condition.Moreover, expenditures incurred in implementing and maintaining cyber security and other procedures and controls could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We must comply with extensive environmental requirements, and any exposure to environmental liabilities may adversely affect us.Federal, state, and local requirements relating to the discharge and emission of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes, the remediation and abatement of contaminants, and other activities affecting the environment have had and may continue to have an impact on our operations. Management cannot assess the possible effect of compliance with future environmental requirements or of future environmental claims for which we may not have adequate indemnification or insurance coverage. If we were required to pay the expenses related to any future environmental claims for which neither indemnification nor insurance coverage were available, these expenses could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.Future environmental regulatory developments in the United States and abroad concerning environmental issues, such as climate change, could adversely affect our operations and increase operating costs and, through their impact on our customers, reduce demand for our products and services. Actions may be taken in the future by the U.S. government, state governments within the United States, foreign governments, or the International Civil Aviation Organization to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry. The precise nature of any such requirements and their applicability to us and our customers are difficult to predict, but the impact to us and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant, including the potential for increased fuel costs, carbon taxes or fees, or a requirement to purchase carbon credits.We may need to make significant capital expenditures to keep pace with technological developments in our industry.The industries in which we participate are constantly undergoing development and change, and it is likely that new products, equipment, and methods of repair and overhaul services will be introduced in the future. We may need to make significant expenditures to purchase new equipment and to train our employees to keep pace with any new technological developments. These expenditures could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.​"
14,AIR,AAR CORP,2019-07-18,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS             The following is a description of the principal risks inherent in our business. We are affected by factors that adversely impact the commercial aviation industry.          As a provider of products and services to the commercial aviation industry, we are greatly affected by overall economic conditions of thatindustry. The commercial aviation industry is historically cyclical and has been negatively affected in the past by geopolitical events, high fuel and oil prices, lack of capital, and weak economicconditions. As a result of these and other events, from time to time certain of our customers have filed for bankruptcy protection or ceased operation. The impact of instability in the globalfinancial markets may lead airlines to reduce domestic or international capacity. In addition, certain of our airline customers have in the past been impacted by tight credit markets, which limitedtheir ability to buy parts, services, engines, and aircraft.         Areduction in the operating fleet of aircraft both in the U.S. and abroad will result in reduced demand for parts support and maintenance activities for the type of aircraft affected.Further, tight credit conditions negatively impact the amount of liquidity available to buy parts, services, engines, and aircraft. A deteriorating airline environment may also result in additionalairline bankruptcies, and in such circumstances we may not be able to fully collect outstanding accounts receivable. Reduced demand from customers caused by weak economic conditions, including tightcredit conditions and customer bankruptcies, may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.         Ourbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, and growth rates may be adversely affected by these and other events that impact the aviation industry, including thefollowing: deterioration in the financial condition of our existing and potential customers;  reductions in the need for, or the deferral of, aircraft maintenance and repair services and spare parts support;   retirement of older generation aircraft, resulting in lower prices for spare parts and services for those aircraft;   reductions in demand for used aircraft and engines;  increased in-house maintenance by airlines;  lack of parts in the marketplace;  acts of terrorism;  future outbreaks of infectious diseases; and  acts of God. Our U.S. government contracts may not continue at present sales levels, which may have a material adverseeffect on our financial condition and results of operations.          Our sales to branches, agencies and departments of the U.S. government and their contractors were $546.2 million (26.6% of consolidatedsales) in fiscal 2019 (See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The majority of our U.S. government sales is for products and services supporting DoD logistics and mobilitystrategy and DoS flight operations and are, therefore, subject to changes in defense and other governmental agency funding and spending. Our contracts with the U.S. government and their contractorsare typically agreements to provide products and services at a fixed price and have a term of one year or less, frequently subject to extension for one or more additional periods of one year at theoption of the government customer. Sales to agencies of the U.S. government and their contractors are 7 Table of Contentssubjectto a number of factors, including the level of troop deployment worldwide, competitive bidding, U.S. government funding, requirements generated by world events, and budgetary constraints.         U.S.government programs are subject to annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes. In recent years, U.S. government appropriations have been affected bylarger U.S. government budgetary issues and related legislation, including the statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt (the ""debt ceiling""). These issues could negatively affect thetimely collection of our U.S. government invoices.         Futurecongressional appropriation and authorization of defense spending and the application of sequestration remain marked by significant debate and an uncertain schedule. The federaldebt limit continues to be actively debated as plans for long-term national fiscal policy are discussed. The outcome of these debates could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly andprograms we support in particular.         Ifthere are funding delays and constraints, we may be required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. government contracts even if the U.S. government isunable to make timely payments. Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existingcontracts or programs which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. If we fail to comply with government procurement laws and regulations, we could lose business and be liablefor various penalties or sanctions.          We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of government contracts. In the U.S., theselaws and regulations include the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Truth in Negotiations Act, Cost Accounting Standards, and laws, regulations, and ordersrestricting the use and dissemination of classified information under the U.S. export control laws and the export of certain products and technical information and safeguarding of contractorinformation systems.         Inaddition, we are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable under government contracts. U.S.government agencies routinely audit government contractors to review performance under contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards, as well as theadequacy of and compliance with internal control systems and policies, including the contractor's purchasing, property, estimating, compensation and management information systems. Any costs found tobe misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract are not reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must be refunded. Also, any inadequacies in our systems and policies couldresult in payments being withheld, penalties and reduced future business.         U.S.government rules allow contracting officers to impose contractual withholdings at no less than certain minimum levels if a contracting officer determines that one or more of acontractor's business systems have one or more significant deficiencies. If a contracting officer were to impose such a withholding on us or even one of our prime contractors, it would increase therisk that we would not be paid in full or paid timely. If future audit adjustments exceed our estimates, our profitability could be adversely affected.         Ifa government inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions, including contracttermination, fines, forfeiture of fees, suspension of payment and suspension or debarment from doing business with government agencies, any of which could materially adversely affect our reputation,business, financial condition and results of operations. 8 Table of ContentsWe use estimates when accounting for long-term contracts and face risks of cost overruns and losses onfixed-price contracts.          We sell certain of our products and services to our commercial, government, and defense customers under firm contracts providing for fixed unitprices, regardless of costs incurred by us. The cost of producing products or providing services may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, overhead, and otherunknown variants, including manufacturing and other operational inefficiencies and differences between assumptions used by us to price a contract and actual results. Increased costs may result in costoverruns and losses on such contracts, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.         Werecognize revenue on our long-term contracts primarily over time as there is continuous transfer of control to the customer over the duration of the contract as the services aredelivered, which generally requires estimates of total costs at completion, fees earned on the contract, or both. This estimation process is complex and involves significant judgment related toassumptions on flight hours, component repair costs, labor hours and rates, and contract penalties and incentives. Adjustments to estimates are often required as work progresses, experience is gainedand additional information becomes known, even though the scope of the work required under the contract may not change. Any adjustment as a result of a change in estimate is recognized as eventsbecome known. Changes in the underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates could result in adjustments that may adversely affect our future financial results. If our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their contractual obligations, our contract profitabilityand our ability to win new contracts may be adversely affected.          We rely on subcontractors to perform a portion of the services we agree to provide our customers, and our suppliers provide necessary inventoryand component parts. A failure by one or more of our subcontractors or suppliers to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed-upon services or supplies may affect our ability to perform ourcontractual obligations. Deficiencies in the performance of our subcontractors and/or suppliers could result in liquidated damages or our customer terminating our contract for default. A terminationfor default could expose us to liability and adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to win new contract awards. We are subject to significant government regulation and may need to incur significant expenses to comply withnew or more stringent governmental regulation.          The aviation industry is highly regulated by the FAA in the United States and equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. Before we sellany of our products that are to be installed in an aircraft, such as engines, engine parts and components, and airframe and accessory parts and components, they must meet certain standards ofairworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in certain other countries. We operate repair stations that are licensed by the FAA and the equivalent regulatory agencies incertain other countries, and hold certificates to operate aircraft. Specific regulations vary from country to country; although regulatory requirements in other countries are generally satisfied bycompliance with FAA requirements. New and more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted in the future that, if enacted, may have an adverse impact on us.         Ifany of our material licenses, certificates, authorizations, or approvals were revoked or suspended by the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries, our results ofoperations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Success at our airframe maintenance facilities is dependent upon continued outsourcing by the airlines.          We currently perform airframe maintenance, repair, and overhaul activities at seven leased locations. Revenues at these facilities fluctuatebased on demand for maintenance which, in turn, is driven by the 9 Table of Contentsnumberof aircraft operating and the extent of outsourcing of maintenance activities by airlines. In addition, certain airlines operate certain new fleet types and/or newer generation aircraft and wemay not have contractual arrangements to service these aircraft nor technicians trained and certified to perform the required airframe maintenance, repair, and overhaul activities. If either thenumber of aircraft operating or the level of outsourcing of maintenance activities declines, we may not be able to execute our operational and financial plans at our maintenance, repair, and overhaulfacilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our operations would be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled personnel or work stoppages.          We are dependent on an educated and highly skilled workforce because of the complex nature of many of our products and services. Furthermore, wehave a collective bargaining agreement covering approximately 200 employees. Our ability to operate successfully and meet our customers' demands could be jeopardized if we are unable to attract andretain a sufficient number of skilled personnel, including qualified licensed mechanics, to conduct our business, or if we experience a significant or prolonged work stoppage. These and similar eventsmay adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We operate in highly competitive markets, and competitive pressures may adversely affect us.          The markets for our products and services to our commercial, government, and defense customers are highly competitive, and we face competitionfrom a number of sources, bothdomestic and international. Our competitors include aircraft manufacturers, aircraft component and parts manufacturers, airline and aircraft service companies, other companies providing maintenance,repair and overhaul services, other aircraft spare parts distributors and redistributors. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and others mayprice their products and services below our selling prices. These competitive markets also create pressure on our ability to hire and retain qualified technicians and other skilled labor needs. Webelieve that our ability to compete depends on superior customer service and support, on-time delivery, sufficient inventory availability, competitive pricing, and effective quality assuranceprograms.         Ourgovernment customers, including the DoD and DoS, may turn to commercial contractors, rather than traditional defense contractors, for certain work, or may utilize set asides such assmall business, women-owned, or minority-owned contractors or determine to source work internally rather than use us. We are also impacted by bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new programawards and task orders. Bid protests could result in significant expense for us, contract modifications, or the award decision being overturned and loss of the contract award. Even where a bid protestdoes not result in the loss of an award, the resolution can extend the time until the contract activity can begin, and delay earnings. These competitive pressures, with potential impacts on both ourcommercial and government business, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We are exposed to risks associated with operating internationally.          We conduct our business in a number of foreign countries, some of which are politically unstable or subject to military or civil conflicts.Consequently, we are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following: military conflicts, civil strife, and political risks;  export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;  compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, United Kingdom (""UK"") Anti-bribery Act, and other anti-bribery and anti-corruptionlaws;  the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws, treaties, and technical standards and changes in those regulations; 10 Table of Contents contract award and funding delays;  potential restrictions on transfers of funds;  import and export duties and value added taxes;  foreign exchange risk;  transportation delays and interruptions;  uncertainties arising from foreign local business practices and cultural considerations; and  changes in U.S. policies on trade relations and trade policy, including implementation of or changes in trade sanctions, tariffs, andembargoes.         Inaddition, the UK held a referendum in 2016 in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (""EU"") referred to as Brexit. There continues to be substantial uncertaintyregarding the economic impact of the UK's potential exit from the EU. Potential adverse consequences of Brexit include global market uncertainty, volatility in currency exchange rates, greaterrestrictions on imports and exports between the UK and other countries and increased regulatory complexities.         Whilewe have adopted and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of doing business internationally, such measures may not beadequate, and the regions in which we operate might not continue to be stable enough to allow us to operate profitably or at all. Acquisitions expose us to risks, including the risk that we may be unable to effectively integrate acquiredbusinesses.          We have completed multiple acquisitions over the past few years and we have discussions with third parties regarding acquisitions on a regularbasis. Acquisitions involve risks, including difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel, the effects of amortization of any acquired intangible assets and the potential impairment ofgoodwill, and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired business. In addition, acquisitions often require substantial management resources and have the potential to divert our attention fromour existing business. For any businesses we may acquire in the future, we may not be able to execute our operational, financial, or integration plans for the acquired businesses, which couldadversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Market values for our aviation products fluctuate and we may be unable to recover our costs incurred onengines, rotable components and other aircraft parts.          We make a number of assumptions when determining the recoverability of rotable components, engines, and other assets which are on lease,available for lease, or supporting our long-term programs. These assumptions include historical sales trends, current and expected usage trends, replacement values, current and expected lease rates,residual values, future demand, and future cash flows. Reductions in demand for these assets or declining market values, as well as differencesbetween actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining the recoverability of our aircraft, engines, and other assets could result in impairment charges in future periods, whichwould adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We may need to reduce the carrying value of our assets.          We own and distribute a significant amount of engines, aircraft parts and components, as well as own manufacturing facilities and joint ventureinvestments. The removal of aircraft from service or recurring losses in certain operations could require us to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of those assets and record animpairment charge through earnings to reduce the carrying value. During the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and second quarter of fiscal 2018, we recognized impairment charges of $74.1 million 11 Table of Contentsand$54.2 million, respectively, related to assets included in our COCO business which is classified as a discontinued operation. In addition, if aircraft or engines for which we offerreplacement parts or supply repair and overhaul services are retired and there are fewer aircraft that require these parts or services, our revenues may decline.         Wemake a number of assumptions when determining the recoverability of our assets including historical sales trends, current and expected usage trends, replacement values, current andexpected lease rates, residual values, future demand, and future cash flows. Differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining the recoverability of our assetscould result in impairment charges in future periods, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.         Wehave recorded goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions. If we are unable to achieve the projected levels of operating results, it may be necessary to record animpairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and related intangible assets. During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $9.8 millionrelated to our COCO business. Similarly, if we were to lose a key customer or if a regulator were to terminate any of our repair certificates at our airframe maintenance or landing gear facilities, wemight be required to record an impairment charge if we were unable to operate. We are dependent upon continued availability of financing to manage our business and to execute our businessstrategy, and additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us.          Our ability to manage our business and to execute our business strategy is dependent, in part, on the continued availability of debt and equitycapital. Access to the debt and equity capital markets may be limited by various factors, including the condition of overall credit markets, general economic factors, state of the aviation industry,our financial performance, and credit ratings. Debt and equity capital may not continue to be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms couldadversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.         LIBOR,the London interbank offered rate, is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting theinterest rate on loans globally. Interest rates under our Revolving Credit Facility are based partly on the LIBOR rate. LIBOR is currently expected to phase out by the end of 2021. It is unclear if atthat time LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. If the method for calculation of LIBOR changes, if LIBOR isno longer available or if lenders have increased costs due to changes in LIBOR, we may suffer from potential increases in interest rates on our borrowings. Further, we may need to renegotiate ourcredit facilities or any other borrowings that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established. Our existing debt includes restrictive and financial covenants.          Certain financing arrangements, including our Revolving Credit Facility and our accounts receivable financing program, require us to comply withvarious restrictive covenants and some contain financial covenants that require us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests. Our failure to meet these covenants could result in defaultunder these loan and debt agreements and may result in a cross-default under other debt agreements. In the event of a default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amountsoutstanding under our debt agreements could be declared immediately due and payable. Our failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect our results of operations and financialcondition. 12 Table of ContentsOur industry is susceptible to product and other liability claims, and claims not adequately covered byinsurance may adversely affect our financial condition.          Our business exposes us to possible claims for property damage and bodily injury or death which may result if an engine, engine part orcomponent, airframe part or accessory, or any other aviation product that we have sold, manufactured, or repaired fails, or if an aircraft we operated, serviced, or in which our products areinstalled, has an accident. We carry substantial liability insurance in amounts that we believe are adequate for our risk exposure and commensurate with industry norms. However, claims may arise inthe future, and our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us in all circumstances. Additionally, we might not be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage in the future at an acceptablecost. Any liability claim not covered by adequate insurance could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our business could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats or other disruptions.          Our business depends heavily on information technology and computerized systems to communicate and operate effectively. The Company's systemsand technologies, or those of third parties on which we rely, could fail or become unreliable due to equipment failures, software viruses, cyber threats, ransomware attacks, terrorist acts, naturaldisasters, power failures or other causes. These threats arise in some cases as a result of our role as a defense contractor.         Cybersecurity threats are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to our sensitive information, business e-mailcompromises, ransomware attacks, and other electronic security breaches, including at our customers, suppliers, subcontractors, and joint venture partners, that could lead to disruptions in missioncritical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption of data.         Theprocedures and controls we utilize to monitor and mitigate these threats may not be sufficient to prevent security threats from materializing. If any of these events were tomaterialize, the costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results,and financial condition.         Moreover,expenditures incurred in implementing and maintaining cyber security and other procedures and controls could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We must comply with extensive environmental requirements, and any exposure to environmental liabilities mayadversely affect us.          Federal, state, and local requirements relating to the discharge and emission of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardouswastes, the remediation and abatement of contaminants, and other activities affecting the environment have had and may continue to have an impact on our operations. Management cannot assess thepossible effect of compliance with future environmental requirements or of future environmental claims for which we may not have adequate indemnification or insurance coverage. If we were required topay the expenses related to any future environmental claims for which neither indemnification nor insurance coverage were available, these expenses could have an adverse impact on our results ofoperations and financial condition.         Futureenvironmental regulatory developments in the United States and abroad concerning environmental issues, such as climate change, could adversely affect our operations and increaseoperating costs and, through their impact on our customers, reduce demand for our products and services. Actions may be taken in the future by the U.S. government, state governments within the UnitedStates, foreign governments, or the International Civil Aviation Organization to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry. The precise nature of any such requirements andtheir applicability to us and our customers are difficult to predict, but the impact to us and the aviation industry would likely be 13 Table of Contentsadverseand could be significant, including the potential for increased fuel costs, carbon taxes or fees, or a requirement to purchase carbon credits. We may need to make significant capital expenditures to keep pace with technological developments in ourindustry.          The industries in which we participate are constantly undergoing development and change, and it is likely that new products, equipment, andmethods of repair and overhaul services will be introduced in the future. We may need to make significant expenditures to purchase new equipment and to train our employees to keep pace with any newtechnological developments. These expenditures could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We identified material weaknesses in our internal controls which, if not remediated appropriately or timely,could affect the reliability of our financial reporting and result in loss of investor confidence and adversely impact our stock price.          During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. Refer toPart II, Item 9A for additional information. We have been implementing and will continue to implement measures designed to ensure that the control deficiencies contributing to thematerial weaknesses are remediated; however, we cannot provide assurance that these measures will be successful. If we are unable to remediate the material weaknesses or are unable to otherwisemaintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to report financial information timely and accurately could be adversely affected. As a result, we could lose investorconfidence and become subject to litigation or investigations, which could adversely affect our business, operations, and financial condition and our stock price"
6,AIR,AAR CORP,2018-07-11,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS             The following is a description of the principal risks inherent in our business. We are affected by factors that adversely impact the commercial aviation industry.          As a provider of products and services to the commercial aviation industry, we are greatly affected by overall economic conditions of thatindustry. The commercial aviation industry is historically cyclical and has been negatively affected in the past by geopolitical events, high fuel and oil prices, lack of capital, and weak economicconditions. As a result of these and other events, from time to time certain of our customers have filed for bankruptcy protection or ceased operation. The impact of instability in the globalfinancial markets may lead airlines to reduce domestic or international capacity. In addition, certain of our airline customers have in the past been impacted by tight credit markets, which limitedtheir ability to buy parts, services, engines, and aircraft.         Areduction in the operating fleet of aircraft both in the U.S. and abroad will result in reduced demand for parts support and maintenance activities for the type of aircraft affected.Further, tight credit conditions negatively impact the amount of liquidity available to buy parts, services, engines, and aircraft. A deteriorating airline environment may also result in additionalairline bankruptcies, and in such circumstances we may not be able to fully collect outstanding accounts receivable. Reduced demand from customers caused by weak economic conditions, including tightcredit conditions and customer bankruptcies, may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.         Ourbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, and growth rates may be adversely affected by these and other events that impact the aviation industry, including thefollowing: deterioration in the financial condition of our existing and potential customers;  reductions in the need for, or the deferral of, aircraft maintenance and repair services and spare parts support;   retirement of older generation aircraft, resulting in lower prices for spare parts and services for those aircraft;   reductions in demand for used aircraft and engines;  increased in-house maintenance by airlines;  lack of parts in the marketplace;  acts of terrorism;  future outbreaks of infectious diseases; and  acts of God. Our U.S. government contracts may not continue at present sales levels, which may have a material adverseeffect on our financial condition and results of operations.          Our sales to branches, agencies and departments of the U.S. government and their contractors were $304.3 million (17.4% of consolidatedsales) in fiscal 2018 (See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The majority of our U.S. government sales is for products and services supporting DoD logistics and mobilitystrategy and is, therefore, subject to changes in defense and other governmental agency funding and spending. Our contracts with the U.S. government and their contractors are typically agreements toprovide products and services at a fixed price and have a term of one year or less, frequently subject to extension for one or more additional periods of one year at the option of the governmentcustomer. Sales to agencies of the U.S. government and their contractors are subject to a number of 7 Table of Contentsfactors,including the level of troop deployment worldwide, competitive bidding, U.S. government funding, requirements generated by world events, and budgetary constraints.         U.S.government programs are subject to annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes. In recent years, U.S. government appropriations have been affected bylarger U.S. government budgetary issues and related legislation, including the statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt (the ""debt ceiling""). These issues could negatively affect thetimely collection of our U.S. government invoices.         Futurecongressional appropriation and authorization of defense spending and the application of sequestration remain marked by significant debate and an uncertain schedule. The federaldebt limit continues to be actively debated as plans for long-term national fiscal policy are discussed. The outcome of these debates could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly andprograms we support in particular.         Ifthere are funding delays and constraints, we may be required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. government contracts even if the U.S. government isunable to make timely payments. Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existingcontracts or programs which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We face risks of cost overruns and losses on fixed-price contracts.          We sell certain of our products and services to our commercial, government, and defense customers under firm contracts providing for fixed unitprices, regardless of costs incurred by us. The cost of producing products or providing services may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, overhead, and otherunknown variants, including manufacturing and other operational inefficiencies and differences between assumptions used by us to price a contract and actual results. Increased costs may result in costoverruns and losses on such contracts, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Success at our airframe maintenance facilities is dependent upon continued outsourcing by the airlines.          We currently perform airframe maintenance, repair and overhaul activities at seven leased locations. Revenues at these facilities fluctuatebased on demand for maintenance which, in turn, is driven by the number of aircraft operating and the extent of outsourcing of maintenance activities by airlines. In addition, certain airlines operatecertain new fleet types and/or newer generation aircraft and we may not have contractual arrangements to service these aircraft nor technicians trained and certified to perform the required airframemaintenance, repair and overhaul activities. If either the number of aircraft operating or the level of outsourcing of maintenance activities declines, we may not be able to execute our operationaland financial plans at our maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We operate in highly competitive markets, and competitive pressures may adversely affect us.          The markets for our products and services to our commercial, government, and defense customers are highly competitive, and we face competitionfrom a number of sources, both domestic and international. Our competitors include aircraft manufacturers, aircraft component and parts manufacturers, airline and aircraft service companies, othercompanies providing maintenance, repair and overhaul services, other aircraft spare parts distributors and redistributors, and other expeditionary airlift service providers. Some of our competitorshave substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and others may price their products and services below our selling prices. These competitive markets also create pressure on ourability to hire and retain qualified technicians and other skilled labor needs. We believe that our 8 Table of Contentsabilityto compete depends on superior customer service and support, on-time delivery, sufficient inventory availability, competitive pricing and effective quality assurance programs.         Ourgovernment customers, including the DoD, may turn to commercial contractors, rather than traditional defense contractors, for certain work, or may utilize small business contractorsor determine to source work internally rather than use us. We are also impacted by bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards. Bid protests could result in significant expense forus, contract modifications, or the award decision being overturned and loss of the contract award. Even where a bid protest does not result in the loss of an award, the resolution can extend the timeuntil the contract activity can begin, and delay earnings. These competitive pressures, with potential impacts on both ourcommercial and government business, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to significant government regulation and may need to incur significant expenses to comply withnew or more stringent governmental regulation.          The aviation industry is highly regulated by the FAA in the United States and equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. Before we sellany of our products that are to be installed in an aircraft, such as engines, engine parts and components, and airframe and accessory parts and components, they must meet certain standards ofairworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in certain other countries. We operate repair stations that are licensed by the FAA and the equivalent regulatory agencies incertain other countries, and hold certificates to operate aircraft. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although regulatory requirements in other countries are generally satisfied bycompliance with FAA requirements. New and more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted in the future that, if enacted, may have an adverse impact on us.         Ifany of our material licenses, certificates, authorizations, or approvals were revoked or suspended by the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries, our results ofoperations and financial condition may be adversely affected. If we fail to comply with government procurement laws and regulations, we could lose business and be liablefor various penalties or sanctions.          We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. government contracts. These laws andregulations include the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Truth in Negotiations Act, Cost Accounting Standards, and laws, regulations, and ordersrestricting the use and dissemination of classified information under the U.S. export control laws and the export of certain products and technical information and safeguarding of contractorinformation systems. Certain government contracts provide audit rights by government agencies, including with respect to performance, costs, business systems, internal controls and compliance withapplicable laws and regulations. In complying with these laws and regulations, we may incur significant costs, and non-compliance may result in the imposition of fines and penalties, includingcontractual damages. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or if a government audit, review, or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civilpenalties, criminal penalties, or administrative sanctions, including suspension or debarment from contracting with the U.S. government. Our reputation could suffer harm if allegations of improprietywere made or found against us, which could adversely affect our operating performance and may result in additional expenses and possible loss of revenue. 9 Table of ContentsWe are exposed to risks associated with operating internationally.          We conduct our business in a number of foreign countries, some of which are politically unstable or subject to military or civil conflicts.Consequently, we are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following: military conflicts, civil strife, and political risks;  export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;  compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, United Kingdom (""UK"") Anti-bribery Act, and other anti-bribery and anti-corruptionlaws;  the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws, treaties, and technical standards and changes in those regulations;   contract award and funding delays;  potential restrictions on transfers of funds;  import and export duties and value added taxes;  foreign exchange risk;  transportation delays and interruptions;  uncertainties arising from foreign local business practices and cultural considerations; and  changes in U.S. policies on trade relations and trade policy, including implementation of or changes in trade sanctions, tariffs, andembargoes.         Inaddition, the UK held a referendum in 2016 in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (""EU""). On March 29, 2017, the UK government commenced the exit processunder Article 50 of the Treaty of the EU by notifying the European Council of the UK's intention to leave the EU. This notification started a two-year time period for the UK and the remainingEU countries to negotiate a withdrawal agreement. The final terms of the UK's potential exit from the EU have yet to be determined and it is possible there will be greater restrictions on imports andexports between the UK and EU countries along with increased regulatory complexities.         Whilewe have adopted and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of doing business internationally, such measures may not beadequate, and theregions in which we operate might not continue to be stable enough to allow us to operate profitably or at all. Acquisitions expose us to risks, including the risk that we may be unable to effectively integrate acquiredbusinesses.          We have completed multiple acquisitions over the past few years and we have discussions with third parties regarding acquisitions on a regularbasis. Acquisitions involve risks, including difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel, the effects of amortization of any acquired intangible assets and the potential impairment ofgoodwill, and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired business. In addition, acquisitions often require substantial management resources and have the potential to divert our attention fromour existing business. For any businesses we may acquire in the future, we may not be able to execute our operational, financial, or integration plans for the acquired businesses, which couldadversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 10 Table of ContentsMarket values for our aviation products fluctuate and we may be unable to recover our costs incurred onengines, rotable components and other aircraft parts.          We make a number of assumptions when determining the recoverability of rotable components, engines, and other assets which are on lease,available for lease, or supporting our long-term programs. These assumptions include historical sales trends, current and expected usage trends, replacement values, current and expected lease rates,residual values, future demand, and future cash flows. Reductions in demand for these assets or declining market values, as well as differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized byus when determining the recoverability of our aircraft, engines, and other assets could result in impairment charges in future periods, which would adversely affect our results of operations andfinancial condition. We may need to reduce the carrying value of our assets.          We own and distribute a significant amount of engines, aircraft parts and components, and manufacturing facilities and related equipment. Theremoval of aircraft from service or recurring losses in certain operations could require us to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of those assets and record an impairment charge throughearnings to reduce the carrying value. During the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we recognized impairment charges of $54.2 million related to assets included in our COCO business which isclassified as a discontinued operation. In addition, if aircraft or engines for which we offer replacement parts or supply repair and overhaul services are retired and there are fewer aircraft thatrequire these parts or services, our revenues may decline.         Wemake a number of assumptions when determining the recoverability of our assets including historical sales trends, current and expected usage trends, replacement values, current andexpected lease rates, residual values, future demand, and future cash flows. Differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining the recoverability of our assetscould result in impairment charges in future periods, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.         Wehave recorded goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions. If we are unable to achieve the projected levels of operating results, it may be necessary to record animpairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and related intangible assets. During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $9.8 millionrelated to our COCO business. Similarly, if we were to lose a key customer or one of our airframe maintenance or landing gear facilities were to lose its authority to operate, we might be required torecord an impairment charge. We are dependent upon continued availability of financing to manage our business and to execute our businessstrategy, and additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us.          Our ability to manage our business and to execute our business strategy is dependent, in part, on the continued availability of debt and equitycapital. Access to the debt and equity capital markets may be limited by various factors, including the condition of overall credit markets, general economic factors, state of the aviation industry,our financial performance, and credit ratings. Debt and equity capital may not continue to be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms couldadversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our existing debt includes restrictive and financial covenants.          Certain financing arrangements, including our Revolving Credit Facility and our accounts receivable financing program, require us to comply withvarious restrictive covenants and some contain financial covenants that require us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests. Our failure to meet these covenants could result in defaultunder these loan and debt agreements and may result in a cross-default under other debt agreements. In the event of a default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amountsoutstanding under our debt agreements could be declared immediately due and payable. Our 11 Table of Contentsfailureto comply with these covenants could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our industry is susceptible to product and other liability claims, and claims not adequately covered byinsurance may adversely affect our financial condition.          Our business exposes us to possible claims for property damage and bodily injury or death which may result if an engine, engine part orcomponent, airframe part or accessory, or any other aviation product which we have sold, manufactured, or repaired fails, or if an aircraft we operated, serviced, or in which our products areinstalled, crashes. We carry substantial liability insurance in amounts that we believe are adequate for our risk exposure and commensurate with industry norms. However, claims may arise in thefuture, and our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us in all circumstances. Additionally, we might not be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage in the future at an acceptablecost. Any liability claim not covered by adequate insurance could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our business could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats or other disruptions.          Our businesses depend heavily on information technology and computerized systems to communicate and operate effectively. The Company's systemsand technologies, or those ofthird parties on which we rely, could fail or become unreliable due to equipment failures, software viruses, cyber threats, ransomware attacks, terrorist acts, natural disasters, power failures orother causes. These threats arise in some cases as a result of our role as a defense contractor.         Cybersecurity threats are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to our sensitive information, ransomware attacks,including our customers, suppliers, subcontractors, and joint venture partners, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems, unauthorized releaseof confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption of data.         Theprocedures and controls we utilize to monitor and mitigate these threats may not be sufficient to prevent security threats from materializing. If any of these events were tomaterialize, the costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results,and financial condition.         Moreover,expenditures incurred in implementing and maintaining cyber security and other procedures and controls could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We must comply with extensive environmental requirements, and any exposure to environmental liabilities mayadversely affect us.          Federal, state, and local requirements relating to the discharge and emission of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardouswastes, the remediation and abatement of contaminants, and other activities affecting the environment have had and may continue to have an impact on our operations. Management cannot assess thepossible effect of compliance with future environmental requirements or of future environmental claims for which we may not have adequate indemnification or insurance coverage. If we were required topay the expenses related to any future environmental claims for which neither indemnification nor insurance coverage were available, these expenses could have an adverse impact on our results ofoperations and financial condition.         Futureenvironmental regulatory developments in the United States and abroad concerning environmental issues, such as climate change, could adversely affect our operations and increaseoperating costs and, through their impact on our customers, reduce demand for our products and services. Actions may be taken in the future by the U.S. government, state governments within the UnitedStates, foreign 12 Table of Contentsgovernments,the International Civil Aviation Organization, or by signatory countries through a new global climate change treaty to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry.The precise nature of any such requirements and their applicability to us and our customers are difficult to predict, but the impact to us and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and couldbe significant, including the potential for increased fuel costs, carbon taxes or fees, or a requirement to purchase carbon credits. We may need to make significant capital expenditures to keep pace with technological developments in ourindustry.          The industries in which we participate are constantly undergoing development and change, and it is likely that new products, equipment, andmethods of repair and overhaul services will be introduced in the future. We may need to make significant expenditures to purchase new equipment and to train our employees to keep pace with any newtechnological developments. These expenditures could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our operations would be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled personnel or work stoppages.          We are dependent on an educated and highly skilled workforce because of the complex nature of many of our products and services. Furthermore, wehave a collective bargaining agreement covering approximately 155 employees. Our ability to operate successfully and meet our customers' demands could be jeopardized if we are unable to attract andretain a sufficient number of skilled personnel, including qualified licensed mechanics, to conduct our business, or if we experience a significant or prolonged work stoppage. These and similar eventsmay adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition"

We are affected by factors that adversely impact the commercial aviation industry.          As a provider of products and services to the commercial aviation industry, we are greatly affected by overall economic conditions of thatindustry. The commercial aviation industry is historically cyclical and has been negatively affected in the past by geopolitical events, high fuel and oil prices, lack of capital, and weak economicconditions.

The impact of instability in the globalfinancial markets may lead airlines to reduce domestic or international capacity. In addition, certain of our airline customers have in the past been impacted by tight credit markets, which limitedtheir ability to buy parts, services, engines, and aircraft.         Areduction in the operating fleet of aircraft both in the U.S. and abroad will result in reduced demand for parts support and maintenance activities for the type of aircraft affected.Further, tight credit conditions negatively impact the amount of liquidity available to buy parts, services, engines, and aircraft. A deteriorating airline environment may also result in additionalairline bankruptcies, and in such circumstances we may not be able to fully collect outstanding accounts receivable. Reduced demand from customers caused by weak economic conditions, including tightcredit conditions and customer bankruptcies, may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.         Ourbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, and growth rates may be adversely affected by these and other events that impact the aviation industry, including thefollowing: deterioration in the financial condition of our existing and potential customers;  reductions in the need for, or the deferral of, aircraft maintenance and repair services and spare parts support;   retirement of older generation aircraft, resulting in lower prices for spare parts and services for those aircraft;   reductions in demand for used aircraft and engines;  increased in-house maintenance by airlines;  lack of parts in the marketplace;  acts of terrorism;  future outbreaks of infectious diseases; and  acts of God. Our U.S. government contracts may not continue at present sales levels, which may have a material adverseeffect on our financial condition and results of operations.          Our sales to branches, agencies and departments of the U.S. government and their contractors were $454.8 million (25.7% of consolidatedsales) in fiscal 2017 (See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The majority of our U.S. government contracts is for products and services supporting DoD logistics andmobility strategy, as well as for expeditionary airlift services and is, therefore, subject to changes in defense and other governmental agency funding and spending. Our contracts with the U.S.government, including the DoD and its contractors, are typically agreements to provide products and services at a fixed price and have a term of one year or less, frequently subject to extension forone or more additional periods of one year at the option of thegovernment customer. Sales to agencies of the U.S. government and their contractors are subject to a number of factors, including the level of troop 7 Table of Contentsdeploymentworldwide, competitive bidding, U.S. government funding, requirements generated by world events, and budgetary constraints.         U.S.government programs are subject to annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes. In recent years, U.S. government appropriations have been affected bylarger U.S. government budgetary issues and related legislation. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (the ""Budget Act"") which raised the statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt (thedebt ceiling) until March 2017 and raised the sequester caps imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011. The suspension of the federal debt limit has not been extended beyond March 2017 which couldnegatively affect the timely collection of our U.S. government invoices.         Futurecongressional appropriation and authorization of defense spending and the application of sequestration remain marked by significant debate and an uncertain schedule. The federaldebt limit continues to be actively debated as plans for long-term national fiscal policy are discussed. The outcome of these debates could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly andprograms we support in particular.         Ifthe existing federal debt limit is not raised, we may be required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. government contracts even if the U.S.government is unable to make timely payments. Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays ofexisting contracts or programs which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We face risks of cost overruns and losses on fixed-price contracts.          We sell certain of our products and services to our commercial, government, and defense customers under firm contracts providing for fixed unitprices, regardless of costs incurred by us. The cost of producing products or providing services may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, overhead, and otherunknown variants, including manufacturing and other operational inefficiencies and differences between assumptions used by us to price a contract and actualresults. Increased costs may result in cost overruns and losses on such contracts, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Success at our airframe maintenance facilities is dependent upon continued outsourcing by the airlines.          We currently perform airframe maintenance, repair and overhaul activities at five leased facilities. Revenues at these facilities fluctuatebased on demand for maintenance which, in turn, is driven by the number of aircraft operating and the extent of outsourcing of maintenance activities by airlines. In addition, certain airlines operatecertain new fleet types and/or newer generation aircraft and we may not have contractual arrangements to service these aircraft nor technicians trained and certified to perform the required airframemaintenance, repair and overhaul activities. If either the number of aircraft operating or the level of outsourcing of maintenance activities declines, we may not be able to execute our operationaland financial plans at our maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We operate in highly competitive markets, and competitive pressures may adversely affect us.          The markets for our products and services to our commercial, government, and defense customers are highly competitive, and we face competitionfrom a number of sources, both domestic and international. Our competitors include aircraft manufacturers, aircraft component and parts manufacturers, airline and aircraft service companies, othercompanies providing maintenance, repair and overhaul services, other aircraft spare parts distributors and redistributors, and other expeditionary airlift service providers. Some of our competitorshave substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and others may price their products and services below our selling prices. We believe that our ability to compete depends 8 Table of Contentsonsuperior customer service and support, on-time delivery, sufficient inventory availability, competitive pricing and effective quality assurance programs.         Ourgovernment customers, including the DoD, may turn to commercial contractors, rather than traditional defense contractors, for certain work, or may utilize small business contractorsor determine to source work internally rather than use us. We are also impacted by bid protests from unsuccessfulbidders on new program awards. Bid protests could result in significant expense for us, contract modifications, or the award decision being overturned and loss of the contract award. Even where a bidprotest does not result in the loss of an award, the resolution can extend the time until the contract activity can begin, and delay earnings. These competitive pressures, with potential impacts onboth our commercial and government business, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to significant government regulation and may need to incur significant expenses to comply withnew or more stringent governmental regulation.          The aviation industry is highly regulated by the FAA in the United States and equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. Before we sellany of our products that are to be installed in an aircraft, such as engines, engine parts and components, and airframe and accessory parts and components, they must meet certain standards ofairworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in certain other countries. We operate repair stations that are licensed by the FAA and the equivalent regulatory agencies incertain other countries, and hold certificates to operate aircraft. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although regulatory requirements in other countries are generally satisfied bycompliance with FAA requirements. New and more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted in the future that, if enacted, may have an adverse impact on us.         Ifany of our material licenses, certificates, authorizations, or approvals were revoked or suspended by the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries, our results ofoperations and financial condition may be adversely affected. If we fail to comply with government procurement laws and regulations, we could lose business and be liablefor various penalties or sanctions.          We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. government contracts. These laws andregulations include the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Truth in Negotiations Act, Cost Accounting Standards, and laws, regulations, and ordersrestricting the use and dissemination of classified information under the U.S. export control laws and the export of certain products and technical information. Certain government contracts provideaudit rights by government agencies, including with respect to performance, costs, internal controls and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In complying with these laws and regulations,we may incur significant costs, and non-compliance may result in the imposition of fines and penalties, including contractual damages. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or if agovernment audit, review, or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil penalties, criminal penalties, or administrative sanctions, including suspension ordebarment from contracting with the U.S. government.Our reputation could suffer harm if allegations of impropriety were made or found against us, which could adversely affect our operating performance and may result in additional expenses and possibleloss of revenue. A significant portion of our expeditionary airlift revenue is derived from providing expeditionary airliftservices in Afghanistan.          Our expeditionary airlift business derives a significant portion of its revenue from providing expeditionary airlift services in Afghanistan forthe DoD. The U.S. has been reducing military activities in Afghanistan and the number of troops in Afghanistan is currently less than 10,000. Our expeditionary 9 Table of Contentsairliftservices revenue will likely experience further declines should troop reductions occur in Afghanistan or we do not receive task orders for future services under our indefinite delivery,indefinite quantity contract awards.         Weare bidding on expeditionary airlift contracts in other regions supporting both DoD and non-DoD customers, although there can be no assurance we will be awarded any of thesecontracts. Although we expect ongoing demand for expeditionary airlift services in Afghanistan and other regions from the DoD and other governmental departments, we are exposed to the risk that ourexpeditionary airlift revenues may further decline if contracts are not renewed, renewed only in part, or are terminated, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financialcondition. If we are unable to successfully redeploy aircraft not actively supporting current customers at favorable rates or sell them on favorable terms, it could have a material adverse effect onour business, results of operations and financial condition.         U.S.government contractors that provide support services in theaters of conflict such as Afghanistan have come under increasing scrutiny by agency inspectors general, governmentauditors and congressional committees. Investigations pursued by any or all of these groups may result in additional expense, adverse publicity for us and reputational harm, regardless of theunderlying merit of the allegations being investigated. We are exposed to risks associated with operating internationally.          We conduct our business in a number of foreign countries, some of which are politically unstable or subject to military or civil conflicts.Consequently, we are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following: military conflicts, civil strife, and political risks;  export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;  compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, United Kingdom (""UK"") Anti-bribery Act, and other anti-bribery and anti-corruptionlaws;  the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws, treaties, and technical standards and changes in those regulations;   contract award and funding delays;  potential restrictions on transfers of funds;  import and export duties and value added taxes;  foreign exchange risk;  transportation delays and interruptions;  uncertainties arising from foreign local business practices and cultural considerations; and  changes in U.S. policies on trade relations and trade policy, including implementation of or changes in trade sanctions, tariffs, andembargoes.         Inaddition, the UK held a referendum in 2016 in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (""EU""). On March 29, 2017, the UK government commenced the exit processunder Article 50 of the Treaty of the EU by notifying the European Council of the UK's intention to leave the EU. This notification starts a two-year time period for the UK and the remaining EUcountries to negotiate a withdrawal agreement. The terms of the UK's potential exit from the EU have yet to be determined and it is possible there will be greater restrictions on imports and exportsbetween the UK and EU countries along with increased regulatory complexities. 10 Table of Contents        Whilewe have adopted and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of doing business internationally, such measures may not beadequate, and the regions in which we operate might not continue to be stable enough to allow us to operate profitably or at all. Acquisitions expose us to risks, including the risk that we may be unable to effectively integrate acquiredbusinesses.          We explore and have discussions with third parties regarding acquisitions on a regular basis. Acquisitions involve risks, including difficultiesin integrating the operations and personnel, the effects of amortization of any acquired intangible assets and the potential impairment of goodwill, and the potential loss of key employees of theacquired business. In addition, acquisitions often require substantial management resources and have the potential to divert our attention from our existing business. For any businesses we may acquirein the future, we may not be able to execute our operational, financial, or integration plans for the acquired businesses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financialcondition. Market values for our aviation products fluctuate, and we may be unable to re-lease or sell aircraft andengines when their current leases expire.          We make a number of assumptions when determining the recoverability of aircraft, engines, and other assets which are on lease or available forlease. These assumptions include historical sales trends, current and expected usage trends, replacement values, current and expected lease rates, residual values, future demand, and future cashflows. Reductions in demand for these assets or declining market values, as well as differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining the recoverability of ouraircraft, engines, and other assets could result in impairment charges in future periods, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.         Welease aircraft and engines to our customers on an operating lease basis. Our ability to re-lease or sell these assets on acceptable terms when the lease expires is subject to a numberof factors which drive industry capacity, including new aircraft deliveries, availability of used aircraft and engines in the marketplace, competition, financial condition of our customers, overallhealth of the airline industry, and general economic conditions. Our inability to re-lease or sell aircraft and engines could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We may need to reduce the carrying value of our assets.          We own and distribute a significant amount of aircraft, aircraft parts and components, and manufacturing facilities and related equipment. Theremoval of aircraft from service or recurring losses in certain operations could require us to evaluate the recoverability of the carryingvalue of those assets and record an impairment charge through earnings to reduce the carrying value. We recognized impairment charges and other losses of $71.4 million in fiscal 2015 related toour actions to address underperforming product lines and inventories. In addition, if aircraft or engines for which we offer replacement parts or supply repair and overhaul services are retired andthere are fewer aircraft that require these parts or services, our revenues may decline.         Wehave recorded goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions. If we are unable to achieve the projected levels of operating results, it may be necessary to record animpairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and related intangible assets. Similarly, if we were to lose a key customer or one of our airframe maintenance or landing gear facilitieswere to lose its authority to operate, we might be required to record an impairment charge. 11 Table of ContentsWe are dependent upon continued availability of financing to manage our business and to execute our businessstrategy, and additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us.          Our ability to manage our business and to execute our business strategy is dependent, in part, on the continued availability of debt and equitycapital. Access to the debt and equity capital markets may be limited by various factors, including the condition of overall credit markets, general economic factors, state of the aviation industry,our financial performance, and credit ratings. Debt and equity capital may not continue to be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms couldadversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our existing debt includes restrictive and financial covenants.          Certain loan and debt agreements, including our Revolving Credit Facility, require us to comply with various restrictive covenants and somecontain financial covenants that require us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests. Our failure to meet these covenants could result in default under these loan and debt agreements andmay result in a cross-default under other debt agreements. In the event of a default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amounts outstanding under our debt agreements could bedeclared immediately due and payable. Our failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our industry is susceptible to product and other liability claims, and claims not adequately covered byinsurance may adversely affect our financial condition.          Our business exposes us to possible claims for property damage and bodily injury or death which may result if an engine, engine part orcomponent, airframe part or accessory, or any other aviation product which we have sold, manufactured, or repaired fails, or if an aircraft we operated, serviced, or in which our products areinstalled, crashes. We carry substantial liability insurance in amounts that we believe are adequate for our risk exposure and commensurate with industry norms. However, claims may arise in thefuture, and our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us in all circumstances. Additionally, we might not be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage in the future at an acceptablecost. Any liability claim not covered by adequate insurance could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our business could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats or other disruptions.          Our businesses depend heavily on information technology and computerized systems to communicate and operate effectively. The Company's systemsand technologies, or those of third parties on which we rely, could fail or become unreliable due to equipment failures, software viruses, cyber threats, ransomware attacks, terrorist acts, naturaldisasters, power failures or other causes. These threats arise in some cases as a result of our role as a defense contractor.         Cybersecurity threats are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to our sensitive information, ransomware attacks,including our customers, suppliers, subcontractors, and joint venture partners, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems, unauthorized releaseof confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption of data.         Althoughwe utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate these threats, these procedures and controls may not be sufficient to prevent security threats frommaterializing. If any of these events were to materialize, the costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified and could have a material adverseeffect on our reputation, operating results, and financial condition. 12 Table of Contents        Moreover,expenditures incurred in implementing and maintaining cyber security and other procedures and controls could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We must comply with extensive environmental requirements, and any exposure to environmental liabilities mayadversely affect us.          Federal, state, and local requirements relating to the discharge and emission of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardouswastes, the remediation and abatement of contaminants, and other activities affecting the environment have had and may continue to have an impact on our operations. Management cannot assess thepossible effect of compliance with future environmental requirements or of future environmental claims for which we may not have adequate indemnification or insurance coverage. If we were required topay the expenses related to any future environmental claims for which neither indemnification nor insurance coverage were available, these expenses could have an adverse impact on our results ofoperations and financial condition.         Futureenvironmental regulatory developments in the United States and abroad concerning environmental issues, such as climate change, could adversely affect our operations and increaseoperating costs and, through their impact on our customers, reduce demand for our products and services. Actions may be taken in the future by the U.S. government, state governments within the UnitedStates, foreign governments, the International Civil Aviation Organization, or by signatory countries through a new global climate change treaty to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by theaviation industry. The precise nature of any such requirements and their applicability to us and our customers are difficult to predict, but the impact to us and the aviation industry would likely beadverse and could be significant, including the potential for increased fuel costs, carbon taxes or fees, or a requirement to purchase carbon credits. We may need to make significant capital expenditures to keep pace with technological developments in ourindustry.          The industries in which we participate are constantly undergoing development and change, and it is likely that new products, equipment, andmethods of repair and overhaul services will be introduced in the future. We may need to make significant expenditures to purchase new equipmentand to train our employees to keep pace with any new technological developments. These expenditures could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our operations would be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled personnel or work stoppages.          We are dependent on an educated and highly skilled workforce because of the complex nature of many of our products and services. Furthermore, wehave a collective bargaining agreement covering approximately 125 employees. Our ability to operate successfully and meet our customers' demands could be jeopardized if we are unable to attract andretain a sufficient number of skilled personnel, including qualified licensed mechanics, to conduct our business, or if we experience a significant or prolonged work stoppage. These and similar eventsmay adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition"
1,AIR,AAR CORP,2016-07-13,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS             The following is a description of the principal risks inherent in our business. We are affected by factors that adversely impact the commercial aviation industry.          As a provider of products and services to the commercial aviation industry, we are greatly affected by overall economic conditions ofthat industry. The commercial aviation industry is historically cyclical and has been negatively affected in the past by geopolitical events, high fuel and oil prices, lack of capital, and weakeconomic conditions. As a result of these and other events, from time to time certain of our customers have filed for bankruptcy protection or ceased operation. The impact of instability in the globalfinancial markets may lead airlines to reduce domestic or international capacity. In addition, certain of our airline customers have in the past been impacted by tight credit markets, which limitedtheir ability to buy parts, services, engines, and aircraft.         Areduction in the operating fleet of aircraft both in the U.S. and abroad will result in reduced demand for parts support and maintenance activities for the type of aircraft affected.Further, tight credit conditions negatively impact the amount of liquidity available to buy parts, services, engines, and aircraft. A deteriorating airline environment may also result in additionalairline bankruptcies, and in such circumstances we may not be able to fully collect outstanding accounts receivable. Reduced demand from customers caused by weak economic conditions, including tightcredit conditions and customer bankruptcies, may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.         Ourbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, and growth rates may be adversely affected by these and other events that impact the aviation industry, including thefollowing: deterioration in the financial condition of our existing and potential customers;  reductions in the need for, or the deferral of, aircraft maintenance and repair services and spare parts support;   retirement of older generation aircraft, resulting in lower prices for spare parts and services for those aircraft;   reductions in demand for used aircraft and engines;  increased in-house maintenance by airlines;  lack of parts in the marketplace;  terrorist attacks;  future outbreaks of infectious diseases; and  acts of God. Our U.S. government contracts may not continue at present sales levels, which may have a materialadverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.          Our sales to branches, agencies and departments of the U.S. government and their contractors were $513.8 million (30.9% ofconsolidated sales) in fiscal 2016 (See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The majority of our U.S. government contracts is for products and services supporting DoDlogistics and mobility strategy, as well as for expeditionary airlift services and is, therefore, subject to changes in defense and other governmental agency funding and spending. Our contracts withthe U.S. government, including the DoD and its contractors, are typicallyagreements to provide products and services at a fixed price and have a term of one year or less, frequently subject to extension for one or more additional periods of one year at the option of thegovernment customer. Sales to agencies of the U.S. government and their contractors are subject to a number of factors, including the level of troop 7 Table of Contentsdeploymentworldwide, competitive bidding, U.S. government funding, requirements generated by world events, and budgetary constraints.         ThePresident signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (the ""Budget Act"") on November 2, 2015. The Budget Act raises the statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debtuntil March 2017 and raises the sequester caps imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011. However, unforeseen circumstances could cause an extended debt ceiling breach, which could negatively affectthe timely collection of our U.S. government invoices.         Futurecongressional appropriation and authorization of defense spending and the application of sequestration remain marked by significant debate and an uncertain schedule. The federaldebt limit continues to be actively debated as plans for long-term national fiscal policy are discussed. The outcome of these debates could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly andprograms we support in particular.         Ifthe existing federal debt limit is not raised, we may be required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. government contracts even if the U.S.government is unable to make timely payments. Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays ofexisting contracts or programs which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We face risks of cost overruns and losses on fixed-price contracts.          We sell certain of our products and services to our commercial, government, and defense customers under firm contracts providing forfixed unit prices, regardless of costs incurred by us. The cost of producing products or providing services may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, overhead, andother unknown variants, including manufacturing and other operational inefficiencies and differences between assumptions used by us toprice a contract and actual results. Increased costs may result in cost overruns and losses on such contracts, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Success at our airframe maintenance facilities is dependent upon continued outsourcing by theairlines.          We currently perform airframe maintenance, repair and overhaul activities at five leased facilities. Revenues at these facilitiesfluctuate based on demand for maintenance which, in turn, is driven by the number of aircraft operating and the extent of outsourcing of maintenance activities by airlines. In addition, certainairlines operate certain new fleet types and/or newer generation aircraft and we may not have contractual arrangements to service these aircraft nor technicians trained and certified to perform therequired airframe maintenance, repair and overhaul activities. If either the number of aircraft operating or the level of outsourcing of maintenance activities declines, we may not be able to executeour operational and financial plans at our maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We operate in highly competitive markets, and competitive pressures may adversely affect us.          The markets for our products and services to our commercial, government, and defense customers are highly competitive, and we facecompetition from a number of sources, both domestic and international. Our competitors include aircraft manufacturers, aircraft component and parts manufacturers, airline and aircraft servicecompanies, other companies providing maintenance, repair and overhaul services, other aircraft spare parts distributors and redistributors, and other expeditionary airlift service providers. Some ofour competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and others may price their products and services below our selling prices. We believe that our ability to competedepends on superior customer service and support, on-time delivery, sufficient inventory availability, competitive pricing and effective quality assurance programs. 8 Table of Contents        Ourgovernment customers, including the DoD, may turn to commercial contractors, rather than traditional defense contractors, for certain work, or may utilize small business contractorsor determine to source work internally rather than use us. We are also impacted by bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards. Bid protests could result in significant expense forus, contract modifications, or the award decision being overturned and loss of the contract award. Even where a bidprotest does not result in the loss of an award, the resolution can extend the time until the contract activity can begin, and delay earnings. These competitive pressures, with potential impacts onboth our commercial and government business, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to significant government regulation and may need to incur significant expenses tocomply with new or more stringent governmental regulation.          The aviation industry is highly regulated by the FAA in the United States and equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. Beforewe sell any of our products that are to be installed in an aircraft, such as engines, engine parts and components, and airframe and accessory parts and components, they must meet certain standards ofairworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in certain other countries. We operate repair stations that are licensed by the FAA and the equivalent regulatory agencies incertain other countries, and hold certificates to operate aircraft. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although regulatory requirements in other countries are generally satisfied bycompliance with FAA requirements. New and more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted in the future that, if enacted, may have an adverse impact on us.         Ifany of our material licenses, certificates, authorizations, or approvals were revoked or suspended by the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries, our results ofoperations and financial condition may be adversely affected. If we fail to comply with government procurement laws and regulations, we could lose business and beliable for various penalties or sanctions.          We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. government contracts. Theselaws and regulations include the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Truth in Negotiations Act, Cost Accounting Standards, and laws, regulations, and ordersrestricting the use and dissemination of classified information under the U.S. export control laws and the export of certain products and technical information. Certain government contracts provideaudit rights by government agencies, including with respect to performance, costs, internal controls and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In complying with these laws and regulations,we may incur significant costs, and non-compliance may result in the imposition of fines and penalties, including contractual damages. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or if agovernment audit, review, or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil penalties, criminal penalties, or administrative sanctions, including suspension ordebarment from contracting with the U.S. government. Our reputation could suffer harm if allegations of impropriety were made or found against us, whichcould adversely affect our operating performance and may result in additional expenses and possible loss of revenue. A significant portion of our expeditionary airlift revenue is derived from providing expeditionaryairlift services in Afghanistan.          Our expeditionary airlift business derives a significant portion of its revenue from providing expeditionary airlift services inAfghanistan for the DoD. The U.S. has been reducing military activities in Afghanistan and had previously announced plans to reduce the number of troops in Afghanistan to 5,500 by the end of calendaryear 2016. Recent announcements by the President have indicated the draw down will be slower than originally planned due to the precarious security situation in Afghanistan with the 9 Table of Contentsnumberof troops expected to be 8,400 by January 2017. Our expeditionary airlift services revenue will likely experience further declines should troop reductions occur in Afghanistan.         Weare bidding on expeditionary airlift contracts in other regions supporting both DoD and non-DoD customers, although there can be no assurance we will be awarded any of thesecontracts. Although we expect ongoing demand for expeditionary airlift services in Afghanistan and other regions from the DoD and other governmental departments, we are exposed to the risk that ourexpeditionary airlift revenues may further decline if contracts are not renewed, renewed only in part, or are terminated, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financialcondition. If we are unable to successfully redeploy aircraft not actively supporting current customers at favorable rates or sell them on favorable terms, it could have a material adverse effect onour business, results of operations and financial condition.         U.S.government contractors that provide support services in theaters of conflict such as Afghanistan have come under increasing scrutiny by agency inspectors general, governmentauditors and congressional committees. Investigations pursued by any or all of these groups may result in additional expense, adverse publicity for us and reputational harm, regardless of theunderlying merit of the allegations being investigated. We are exposed to risks associated with operating internationally.          We conduct our business in certain foreign countries, some of which are politically unstable or subject to military or civil conflicts.Consequently, we are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following: military conflicts, civil strife, and political risks;  export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;  compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, United Kingdom (""UK"") Anti-bribery Act, and other anti-bribery laws;   the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws, treaties, and technical standards and changes in those regulations;   contract award and funding delays;  potential restrictions on transfers of funds;  import and export duties and value added taxes;  foreign exchange risk;  transportation delays and interruptions; and  uncertainties arising from foreign local business practices and cultural considerations.         Inaddition, the UK held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (""EU""). The terms of the UK's potential exit from the EU have yet to be determined and itis possible there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the UK and EU countries along with increased regulatory complexities.         Whilewe have adopted and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of doing business internationally, we cannot ensure that suchmeasures will be adequate or that the regions in which we operate will continue to be stable enough to allow us to operate profitably or at all. 10 Table of ContentsAcquisitions expose us to risks, including the risk that we may be unable to effectively integrateacquired businesses.          We explore and have discussions with third parties regarding acquisitions on a regular basis. Acquisitions involve risks, includingdifficulties in integrating the operations and personnel, the effects of amortization of any acquired intangible assets and the potential impairment of goodwill, and the potential loss of keyemployees of the acquired business. In addition, acquisitions often require substantial management resources and have the potential to divert our attention from our existing business. For anybusinesses we may acquire in the future, we may not be able to execute our operational, financial, or integration plans for the acquired businesses, which could adversely affect our results ofoperations and financial condition. Market values for our aviation products fluctuate, and we may be unable to re-lease or sell aircraftand engines when their current leases expire.          We make a number of assumptions when determining the recoverability of inventories, aircraft, and engines, which are on lease oravailable for lease. These assumptions include historical sales trends, current and expected usage trends, replacement values, current and expected lease rates, residual values, future demand, andfuture cash flows. Reductions in demand for our inventories or declining market values, as well as differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining therecoverability of our inventories, aircraft, and engines, could result in impairment charges in future periods, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.         Welease aircraft and engines to our customers on an operating lease basis. Our ability to re-lease or sell these assets on acceptable terms when the lease expires is subject to a numberof factors which drive industry capacity, including new aircraft deliveries, availability of used aircraft and engines in the marketplace, competition, financial condition of our customers, overallhealth of the airline industry, and general economic conditions. Our inability to re-lease or sell aircraft and engines could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We may need to reduce the carrying value of our assets.          We own and distribute a significant amount of aircraft, aircraft parts and components, and manufacturing facilities and relatedequipment. The removal of aircraft from service or recurring losses in certain operations could require us to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of those assets and record an impairmentcharge through earnings to reduce the carrying value.We recognized impairment charges and other losses of $71.4 million in fiscal 2015 related to our actions to address underperforming product lines and inventories. In addition, if aircraft orengines for which we offer replacement parts or supply repair and overhaul services are retired and there are fewer aircraft that require these parts or services, our revenues may decline.         Wehave recorded goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions. If we are unable to achieve the projected levels of operating results, it may be necessary to record animpairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and related intangible assets. Similarly, if we were to lose a key customer or one of our airframe maintenance or landing gear facilitieswere to lose its authority to operate, we might be required to record an impairment charge. We are dependent upon continued availability of financing to manage our business and to execute ourbusiness strategy, and additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us.          Our ability to manage our business and to execute our business strategy is dependent, in part, on the continued availability of debtand equity capital. Access to the debt and equity capital markets may be limited by various factors, including the condition of overall credit markets, general economic factors, state of the aviationindustry, our financial performance, and credit ratings. Debt and equity capital may not 11 Table of Contentscontinueto be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our existing debt includes restrictive and financial covenants.          Certain loan and debt agreements, including our Credit Facility, require us to comply with various restrictive covenants and somecontain financial covenants that require us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests. Our failure to meet these covenants could result in default under these loan and debt agreements andmay result in a cross-default under other debt agreements. In the event of a default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amounts outstanding under our debt agreements could bedeclared immediately due and payable. Our failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our industry is susceptible to product and other liability claims, and claims not adequately coveredby insurance may adversely affect our financial condition.          Our business exposes us to possible claims for property damage and bodily injury or death which may result if an engine, engine part orcomponent, airframe part or accessory, or any other aviation product which we have sold, manufactured, or repaired fails, or if an aircraft we operated, serviced, or in which our products areinstalled, crashes. We carry substantial liability insurance in amounts that we believe are adequate for our risk exposure and commensurate with industry norms. However, claims may arise in thefuture, and our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us in all circumstances. Additionally, we might not be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage in the future at an acceptablecost. Any liability claim not covered by adequate insurance could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our business could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats or other disruptions.          Our businesses depend heavily on information technology and computerized systems to communicate and operate effectively. The Company'ssystems and technologies, or those of third parties on which we rely, could fail or become unreliable due to equipment failures, software viruses, cyber threats, terrorist acts, natural disasters,power failures or other causes. These threats arise in some cases as a result of our role as a defense contractor.         Cybersecurity threats are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to our sensitive information, including our customers,suppliers, subcontractors, and joint venture partners, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential orotherwise protected information, and corruption of data.         Althoughwe utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate these threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient to preventsecurity threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, the costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified and couldhave a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results, and financial condition.         Moreover,expenditures incurred in implementing cyber security and other procedures and controls could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We must comply with extensive environmental requirements, and any exposure to environmentalliabilities may adversely affect us.          Federal, state, and local requirements relating to the discharge and emission of substances into the environment, the disposal ofhazardous wastes, the remediation and abatement of contaminants, and other 12 Table of Contentsactivitiesaffecting the environment have had and may continue to have an impact on our operations. Management cannot assess the possible effect of compliance with future environmental requirements orof future environmental claims for which we may not have adequate indemnification or insurance coverage. If we were required to pay the expenses related to any future environmental claims for whichneither indemnification nor insurance coverage were available, these expenses could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.         Futureenvironmental regulatory developments in the United States and abroad concerning environmental issues, such as climate change, could adversely affect our operations and increaseoperating costs and, through their impact on our customers, reduce demand for our products and services. Actions may be taken in the future by the U.S. government, state governments within the UnitedStates, foreign governments, the International Civil Aviation Organization, or by signatory countries through a new global climate change treaty to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by theaviation industry. The precise nature of any such requirements and their applicability to us and our customers are difficult to predict, but the impact to us and the aviation industry would likely beadverse and could be significant, including the potential for increased fuel costs, carbon taxes or fees, or a requirement to purchase carbon credits. We may need to make significant capital expenditures to keep pace with technological developments inour industry.          The industries in which we participate are constantly undergoing development and change, and it is likely that new products, equipment,and methods of repair and overhaul services will be introduced in the future. We may need to make significant expenditures to purchase new equipment and to train our employees to keep pace with anynew technologicaldevelopments. These expenditures could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our operations would be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled personnel or work stoppages.          We are dependent on an educated and highly skilled workforce because of the complex nature of many of our products and services.Furthermore, we have a collective bargaining agreement covering approximately 110 employees. Our ability to operate successfully and meet our customers' demands could be jeopardized if we are unableto attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled personnel, including qualified licensed mechanics, to conduct our business, or if we experience a significant or prolonged work stoppage. These andsimilar events may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition"
15,AIR,AAR CORP,2015-07-15,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS             The following is a description of the principal risks inherent in our business. We are affected by factors that adversely impact the commercial aviation industry.          As a provider of products and services to the commercial aviation industry, we are greatly affected by overall economic conditions ofthat industry. The commercial aviation industry is historically cyclical and has been negatively affected in the past by geopolitical events, high fuel and oil prices, lack of capital, and weakeconomic conditions. In addition, as a result of these and other events, from time to time certain of our customers have filed for bankruptcy protection or ceased operation. The impact of instabilityin the global financial markets may lead airlines to reduce domestic or international capacity. In addition, certain of our airline customers have in the past been impacted by tight credit markets,which limited their ability to buy parts, services, engines, and aircraft.         Areduction in the operating fleet of aircraft both in the U.S. and abroad will result in reduced demand for parts support and maintenance activities for the type of aircraft affected.Further, tight credit conditions negatively impact the amount of liquidity available to buy parts, services, engines, and aircraft. A deteriorating airline environment may also result in additionalairline bankruptcies, and in such circumstances we may not be able to fully collect outstanding accounts receivable. Reduced demand from customers caused by weak economic conditions, including tightcredit conditions and customer bankruptcies, may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.         Ourbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, and growth rates may be adversely affected by these and other events that impact the aviation industry, including thefollowing: deterioration in the financial condition of our existing and potential customers;  reductions in the need for, or the deferral of, aircraft maintenance and repair services and spare parts support;   retirement of older generation aircraft, resulting in lower prices for spare parts and services for those aircraft;   reductions in demand for used aircraft and engines;  increased in-house maintenance by airlines;  lack of parts in the marketplace;  future terrorist attacks and the ongoing war on terrorism;  future outbreaks of infectious diseases; and  acts of God. Our U.S. government contracts may not continue at present sales levels, which may have a materialadverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.          Our sales to branches, agencies and departments of the U.S. government and their contractors were $493.1 million (30.9% ofconsolidated sales) in fiscal 2015 (See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The majority of our U.S. government contracts is for products and services supporting DoDlogistics and mobility strategy, as well as for expeditionary airliftservices and is, therefore, subject to changes in defense and other governmental agency funding and spending. Our contracts with the U.S. government, including the DoD and its contractors, aretypically agreements to provide products and services at a fixed price and have a term of one year or less, frequently subject to extension for one or more additional periods of one year at the optionof the government customer. Sales to agencies of the U.S. government and their contractors are subject to a number of factors, including the level of troop 7 Table of Contentsdeploymentworldwide, competitive bidding, U.S. government funding, requirements generated by world events, and budgetary constraints.         Defensefunding continues to face pressure due to U.S. budget deficit challenges. Congress enacted the Budget Control Act of 2011 (""Budget Act""), which reduced defense spending by aminimum of $487 billion over a ten-year period that began in the government's fiscal year 2012. The Budget Act also provided that the defense budget would face ""sequestration"" cuts of up to anadditional $500 billion during that same period to the extent that discretionary spending limits are exceeded. The impact of sequestration cuts was reduced with respect to the government'sfiscal years 2014 and 2015 following the enactment of The Bipartisan Budget Act in December 2013. However, significant uncertainty remains with respect to overall levels of defense spending and it islikely that U.S. government discretionary spending levels will continue to be constrained, including risk of future sequestration cuts.         Futurecongressional appropriation and authorization of defense spending and the application of sequestration remain marked by significant debate and an uncertain schedule. The federaldebt limit continues to be actively debated as plans for long-term national fiscal policy are discussed. The outcome of these debates could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly andprograms we support in particular.         Ifthe existing federal debt limit is not raised, we may be required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. government contracts even if the U.S.government is unable to make timely payments. Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays ofexisting contracts or programs which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We face risks of cost overruns and losses on fixed-price contracts.          We sell certain of our products and services to our commercial, government, and defense customers under firm contracts providing forfixed unit prices, regardless of costs incurred by us. The cost of producing products or providing services may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, overhead, andother unknown variants, including manufacturing and other operational inefficiencies and differences between assumptions used by us to price a contract and actual results. Increased costs may resultin cost overruns and losses on such contracts, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Success at our airframe maintenance facilities is dependent upon continued outsourcing by theairlines.          We currently perform airframe maintenance, repair and overhaul activities at six leased facilities one of which is in the process ofbeing closed. Revenues at these facilities fluctuate based on demand for maintenance which, in turn, is driven by the number of aircraft operating and the extent of outsourcing of maintenanceactivities by airlines. In addition, certain airlines operate certain new fleet types and/or newer generation aircraft and we may not have contractual arrangements to service these aircraft nortechnicians trained and certified to perform the required airframe maintenance, repair and overhaul activities. If either the number of aircraft operating or the level of outsourcing of maintenanceactivities declines, we may not be able to execute our operational and financial plans at our maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations andfinancial condition. We operate in highly competitive markets, and competitive pressures may adversely affect us.          The markets for our products and services to our commercial, government, and defense customers are highly competitive, and we facecompetition from a number of sources, both domestic and international. Our competitors include aircraft manufacturers, aircraft component and parts manufacturers, airline and aircraft servicecompanies, other companies providing maintenance, repair and overhaul services, other aircraft spare parts distributors and redistributors, and other expeditionary airlift service providers. Some 8 Table of Contentsofour competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and others may price their products and services below our selling prices. We believe that our ability tocompete depends on superior customer service and support, on-time delivery, sufficient inventory availability, competitive pricing and effective quality assurance programs.         Ourgovernment customers, including the DoD, may turn to commercial contractors, rather than traditional defense contractors, for certain work, or may utilize small business contractorsor determine to source work internally rather than use us. We are also impacted by bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards. Bid protests could result in significant expense forus, contract modifications, or the award decision being overturned and loss of the contract award. Even where a bid protest does not result in the loss of an award, the resolution can extend the timeuntil the contract activity can begin, and delay earnings. These competitive pressures, with potential impacts on both our commercial and government business, could adversely affect our results ofoperations and financial condition. We are subject to significant government regulation and may need to incur significant expenses tocomply with new or more stringent governmental regulation.          The aviation industry is highly regulated by the FAA in the United States and equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. Beforewe sell any of our products that are to be installed in an aircraft, such as engines, engine parts and components, and airframe and accessory parts and components, they must meet certain standards ofairworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in certain other countries. We operate repair stations that are licensed by the FAA and the equivalent regulatory agencies incertain other countries, and hold certificates to operate aircraft. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although regulatory requirements in other countries are generally satisfied bycompliance with FAA requirements. New and more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted in the future that, if enacted, may have an adverse impact on us.         Ifany of our material licenses, certificates, authorizations, or approvals were revoked or suspended by the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries, our results ofoperations and financial condition may be adversely affected. If we fail to comply with government procurement laws and regulations, we could lose business and beliable for various penalties or sanctions.          We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. government contracts. Theselaws and regulations include the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Truth in Negotiations Act, Cost Accounting Standards, and laws, regulations, and ordersrestricting the use and dissemination of classified information under the U.S. export control laws and the export of certain products and technical information. Certain government contracts provideaudit rights by government agencies, including with respect to performance, costs, internal controls and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In complying with these laws and regulations,we may incur significant costs, and non-compliance may result in the imposition of fines and penalties, including contractual damages. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or if agovernment audit, review, or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil penalties, criminal penalties, or administrative sanctions, including debarment fromcontracting with the U.S. government. Our reputation could suffer harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, which could adversely affect our operating performance and may result inadditional expenses and possible loss of revenue. 9 Table of ContentsA significant portion of our expeditionary airlift revenue is derived from providing expeditionaryairlift services in Afghanistan.          Our expeditionary airlift business derives a significant portion of its revenue from providing expeditionary airlift services inAfghanistan for the DoD. The U.S. has been reducing military activities in Afghanistan and began calendar year 2015 with approximately 10,000 military personnel in Afghanistan. The U.S. governmentpreviously announced plans to reduce the number of troops in Afghanistan by approximately half before the end of calendar year 2016. Recent indications are that the reduction in troops may be slowerthan previously communicated. Our expeditionary airlift services revenue will likely experience further declines as troop reductions occur in Afghanistan.         Weare bidding on expeditionary airlift contracts in other regions supporting both DoD and non-DoD customers, although there can be no assurance we will be awarded any of thesecontracts. Although we expect ongoing demand for expeditionary airlift services in Afghanistan and other regions from the DoD and other governmental departments, we are exposed to the risk that ourexpeditionary airlift revenues may further decline if contracts are not renewed, renewed only in part, or are terminated,which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. If we are unable to successfully redeploy aircraft not actively supporting current customers at favorable rates or sellthem on favorable terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.         U.S.government contractors that provide support services in theaters of conflict such as Afghanistan have come under increasing scrutiny by agency inspectors general, governmentauditors and congressional committees. Investigations pursued by any or all of these groups may result in adverse publicity for us and reputational harm, regardless of the underlying merit of theallegations being investigated. We are exposed to risks associated with operating internationally.          We conduct our business in certain foreign countries, some of which are politically unstable or subject to military or civil conflicts.Consequently, we are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following: military conflicts, civil strife, and political risks;  export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;  compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK Anti-bribery Act, and other anti-bribery laws;   the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws, treaties, and technical standards and changes in those regulations;   contract award and funding delays;  potential restrictions on transfers of funds;  import and export duties and value added taxes;  foreign exchange risk;  transportation delays and interruptions; and  uncertainties arising from foreign local business practices and cultural considerations.         Whilewe have adopted and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of doing business internationally, we cannot ensure that suchmeasures will be adequate or that the regions in which we operate will continue to be stable enough to allow us to operate profitably or at all. 10 Table of ContentsAcquisitions expose us to risks, including the risk that we may be unable to effectively integrateacquired businesses.          We explore and have discussions with third parties regarding acquisitions on a regular basis. Acquisitions involve risks, includingdifficulties in integrating the operations and personnel, the effects of amortization of any acquired intangible assets and the potential impairment of goodwill, and the potential loss of keyemployees of the acquired business. In addition, acquisitions often require substantial management resources and have the potential to divert our attention from our existing business. For anybusinesses we may acquire in the future, we may not be able to execute our operational, financial, or integration plans for the acquired businesses, which could adversely affect our results ofoperations and financial condition. Market values for our aviation products fluctuate, and we may be unable to re-lease or sell aircraftand engines when their current lease expires.          We use a number of assumptions when determining the recoverability of inventories, aircraft, and engines, which are on lease oravailable for lease. These assumptions include historical sales trends, current and expected usage trends, replacement values, current and expected lease rates, residual values, future demand, andfuture cash flows. Reductions in demand for our inventories or declining market values, as well as differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining therecoverability of our inventories, aircraft, and engines, could result in impairment charges in future periods, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.         Welease aircraft and engines to our customers on an operating lease basis. Our ability to re-lease or sell these assets on acceptable terms when the lease expires is subject to a numberof factors which drive industry capacity, including new aircraft deliveries, availability of used aircraft and engines in the marketplace, competition, financial condition of our customers, overallhealth of the airline industry, and general economic conditions. Our inability to re-lease or sell aircraft and engines could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We may need to reduce the carrying value of our assets.          We own and distribute a significant amount of aircraft, aircraft parts and components, and manufacturing facilities and relatedequipment. The removal of aircraft from service or recurring losses in certain operations could require us to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of those assets and record an impairmentcharge through earnings to reduce the carrying value. We recognized impairment charges and other losses of $71.4 million in fiscal 2015 related to our actions to address underperforming productlines and inventories. In addition, if aircraft or engines for which we offer replacement parts or supply repair and overhaul services are retired and there are fewer aircraft that require these partsor services, our revenues may decline.         Wehave recorded goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions. If we are unable to achieve the projected levels of operating results, it may be necessary to record animpairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and related intangible assets. Similarly, if we were to lose a key customer or one of our airframe maintenance or landing gear facilitieswere to lose its authority to operate, we might be required to record an impairment charge. We are dependent upon continued availability of financing to manage our business and to execute ourbusiness strategy, and additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us.          Our ability to manage our business and to execute our business strategy is dependent, in part, on the continued availability of debtand equity capital. Access to the debt and equity capital markets may be limited by various factors, including the condition of overall credit markets, general economic factors, state of the aviationindustry, our financial performance, and credit ratings. Debt and equity capital may not 11 Table of Contentscontinueto be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our existing debt includes restrictive and financial covenants.          Certain loan and debt agreements require us to comply with various restrictive covenants and some contain financial covenants thatrequire us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests. Our failure to meet these covenants could result in default under these loan and debt agreements and may result in a cross-default underother debt agreements. In the event of a default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amounts outstanding under our debt agreements could be declared immediately due and payable.Our failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our industry is susceptible to product and other liability claims, and claims not adequately coveredby insurance may adversely affect our financial condition.          Our business exposes us to possible claims for property damage and bodily injury or death which may result if an engine, engine part orcomponent, airframe part or accessory, or any other aviation product which we have sold, manufactured, or repaired fails, or if an aircraft we operated, serviced, or in which our products areinstalled, crashes we carry substantial liability insurance in amounts that we believe are adequate for our risk exposure and commensurate with industry norms. However, claims may arise in the future,and our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us in all circumstances. Additionally, we might not be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Anyliability claim not covered by adequate insurance could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our business could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats or other disruptions.          Our businesses depend heavily on information technology and computerized systems to communicate and operate effectively. The Company'ssystems and technologies, or those of third parties on which we rely, could fail or become unreliable due to equipment failures, software viruses, cyber threats, terrorist acts, natural disasters,power failures or other causes. These threats arise in some cases as a result of our role as a defense contractor.         Cybersecurity threats are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to our sensitive information, including our customers,suppliers, subcontractors, and joint venture partners, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential orotherwise protected information, and corruption of data.         Althoughwe utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate these threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient to preventsecurity threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, the costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified and couldhave a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results, and financial condition. We must comply with extensive environmental requirements, and any exposure to environmentalliabilities may adversely affect us.          Federal, state, and local requirements relating to the discharge and emission of substances into the environment, the disposal ofhazardous wastes, the remediation and abatement of contaminants, and other activities affecting the environment have had and may continue to have an impact on our operations. Management cannot assessthe possible effect of compliance with future environmental requirements or of future environmental claims for which we may not have adequate indemnification or insurance coverage. If 12 Table of Contentswewere required to pay the expenses related to any future environmental claims for which neither indemnification nor insurance coverage were available, these expenses could have an adverse impact onour results of operations and financial condition.         Futureenvironmental regulatory developments in the United States and abroad concerning environmental issues, such as climate change, could adversely affect our operations and increaseoperating costs and, through their impact on our customers, reduce demand for our products and services. Actions may be taken in the future by the U.S. government, state governments within the UnitedStates, foreign governments, the International Civil Aviation Organization, or by signatory countries through a new global climate change treaty to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by theaviation industry. The precise nature of any such requirements and their applicability to us and our customers are difficult to predict, but the impact to us and the aviation industry would likely beadverse and could be significant, including the potential for increased fuel costs, carbon taxes or fees, or a requirement to purchase carbon credits. We may need to make significant capital expenditures to keep pace with technological developments inour industry.          The industries in which we participate are constantly undergoing development and change, and it is likely that new products, equipment,and methods of repair and overhaul services will be introduced in the future.

These andsimilar events may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition"
5,AIR,AAR CORP,2014-07-17,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS             The following is a description of the principal risks inherent in our business.  We are affected by factors that adversely impact the commercial aviation industry.          As a provider of products and services to the commercial aviation industry, we are greatly affected by overall economic conditions ofthat industry. The commercial aviation industry is historically cyclical and has been negatively affected in the past by geopolitical events, high oil prices, lack of capital, and weak economicconditions. In addition, as a result of these and other events, from time to time certain of our customers have filed for bankruptcy protection or ceased operation.         Incalendar year 2008 and into 2009, demand for air transportation in the United States and abroad declined due to economic deterioration in the U.S. and other global economies. Althoughglobal economic conditions improved in the 2010 to 2014 period, the recovery has generally been sluggish in the U.S. and in many other developed nations. The impact of persistently high fuel costs andthe continued sluggish or weak worldwide economic conditions may lead airlines to reduce domestic or international capacity. In addition, certain of our airline customers have in the past beenimpacted by tight credit markets, which limited their ability to buy parts, services, engines, and aircraft.         Areduction in the operating fleet of aircraft both in the U.S. and abroad will result in reduced demand for parts support and maintenance activities for the type of aircraft affected.Further, tight credit conditions negatively impact the amount of liquidity available to buy parts, services, engines, and aircraft. A deteriorating airline environment may also result in additionalairline bankruptcies, and in such circumstances we may not be able to fully collect outstanding accounts receivable. Reduced demand from customers caused by weak economic conditions, including tightcredit conditions and customer bankruptcies, may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.         Ourbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, and growth rates may be adversely affected by these and other events that impact the aviation industry, including thefollowing: deterioration in the financial condition of our existing and potential customers;   reductions in the need for, or the deferral of, aircraft maintenance and repair services and spare parts support;   retirement of older generation aircraft, resulting in lower prices for spare parts and services for those aircraft;   reductions in demand for used aircraft and engines;  increased in-house maintenance by airlines;  high oil prices;  lack of parts in the marketplace;  future terrorist attacks and the ongoing war on terrorism;  future outbreaks of infectious diseases; and  acts of God.  Our U.S. government contracts may not continue at present sales levels, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.          Our sales to branches, agencies and departments of the U.S. government and their contractors were $694.9 million (34.1% ofconsolidated sales) in fiscal year 2014 (See Note 13of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The majority of our U.S. government contracts is for products and services 6 Table of ContentssupportingDoD logistics and mobility strategy, as well as for supplemental expeditionary airlift services and are, therefore, subject to changes in defense and other governmental agency funding andspending. Our contracts with the U.S. government, including the DoD and its contractors, are typically agreements to provide products and services at a fixed price and have a term of one year or less,frequently subject to extension for one or more additional periods of one year at the option of the government customer. Sales to agencies of the U.S. government and their contractors are subject to anumber of factors, including the level of troop deployment worldwide, competitive bidding, U.S. government funding, requirements generated by world events, and budgetary constraints.         Defensefunding is currently facing pressure due to U.S. budget deficit challenges. Congress enacted the Budget Control Act of 2011 (""Budget Act""), which reduced defense spending by aminimum of $487 billion over a ten-year period that began in the government's fiscal year 2012. As a result of the Budget Act and deficit reduction pressures, it appears likely thatdiscretionary spending by the federal government may remain constrained for several years.         TheAmerican Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (""Taxpayer Relief Act"") delayed the pending sequestration of appropriations imposed by the Budget Act by two months, from January 2, 2013to March 1, 2013, and reduced the amount of the government fiscal year 2013 budget cuts. Sequestration went into effect March 1, 2013. On March 26, 2013, the President signed intolaw the Consolidated Further Continuing Appropriations Act, which included specific appropriations for the DoD.         InOctober 2013, Congress passed a continuing resolution to temporarily fund the government and suspended the statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt (the debt ceiling)through February 7, 2014. In December 2013, Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act for the government's fiscal 2014. Congress also passed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (the""Bipartisan Budget Act""), which set discretionary spending levels for the government's fiscal 2014 and 2015. The Bipartisan Budget Act retained the lower spending limits, including theacross-the-board spending reduction methodology as provided for in the Budget Act. On January 16, 2014, Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014, providing for federalspending levels consistent with the Bipartisan Budget Act. The President signed the legislation into law on January 17, 2014.         Futurecongressional appropriation and authorization of defense spending and the application of sequestration remain marked by significant debate and an uncertain schedule. The debtceiling continues to be actively debated as plans for long-term national fiscal policy are discussed. Theoutcome of these debates could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and programs we support in particular.         Ifthe existing debt ceiling is not raised, we may be required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. Government contracts even if the U.S. Government isunable to make timely payments. The challenging budget environment, including the potential impact from any future sequestration or constraints related to the debt ceiling, could have a materialadverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.  We face risks of cost overruns and losses on fixed-price contracts.          We sell certain of our products and services to our commercial, government, and defense customers under firm contracts providing forfixed unit prices, regardless of costs incurred by us. The cost of producing products or providing services may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, overhead, andother unknown variants, including manufacturing and other operational inefficiencies and differences between assumptions used by us to price a contract and actual results. Increased costs may resultin cost overruns and losses on such contracts, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 7 Table of Contents Significant cost issues may develop in connection with the A400M cargo system.          Our Cargo Systems unit was selected in June 2005 to provide cargo loading systems for the Airbus A400M Military Transport Aircraft(""A400M""). We have incurred significant engineering and development costs in connection with this program (see Note 12 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), and we expect to incuradditional development costs as the design is certified. The certification of our design for full functionality is currently scheduled for the third quarter of calendar 2014. In July 2013, we andAirbus amended the A400M contract to make changes to the Company's role and responsibilities under the program, establish a fixed price per shipset, set applicable weight parameters and make certainother changes.         Wemay not be able to recover our engineering and development costs, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, under certain circumstances, includingthe following: (i) weare not able to obtain certification of the design of the system in the third quarter of calendar 2014; (ii) the A400M program experiences significant additional delivery delays or ordercancellations; (iii) we fail to achieve the expected production cost reductions; (iv) we fail to deliver the items that we are now responsible for in accordance with the terms of theamended contract; or (v) the contract is further amended to change our role and responsibilities.  Success at our airframe maintenance facilities is dependent upon continued outsourcing by the airlines.          We currently perform airframe maintenance, repair and overhaul activities at leased facilities in Indianapolis, Indiana; Oklahoma City,Oklahoma; Miami, Florida; Duluth, Minnesota; Hot Springs, Arkansas; and Lake Charles, Louisiana. Revenues at these facilities fluctuate based on demand for maintenance which, in turn, is driven by thenumber of aircraft operating and the extent of outsourcing of maintenance activities by airlines. If either the number of aircraft operating or the level of outsourcing of maintenance activitiesdeclines, we may not be able to execute our operational and financial plans at our maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financialcondition.  We operate in highly competitive markets, and competitive pressures may adversely affect us.          The markets for our products and services to our commercial, government, and defense customers are highly competitive, and we facecompetition from a number of sources, both domestic and international. Our competitors include aircraft manufacturers, aircraft component and parts manufacturers, airline and aircraft servicecompanies, other companies providing maintenance, repair and overhaul services, other aircraft spare parts distributors and redistributors, and other expeditionary airlift service providers. Some ofour competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and others may price their products and services below our selling prices.         Ourgovernment customers, including the DoD, may turn to commercial contractors, rather than traditional defense contractors, for certain work, or may utilize small business contractorsor determine to source work internally rather than use us. We are also are impacted by bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards. Bid protests could result in significant expense tothe company, contract modifications or the award decision being overturned and loss of the contract award. Even where a bid protest does not result in the loss of an award, the resolution can extendthe time until the contract activity can begin, and delay earnings. These competitive pressures, with potential impacts on both our commercial and government business, could adversely affect ourresults of operations and financial condition.  We are subject to significant government regulation and may need to incur significant expenses to comply with new or more stringent governmental regulation.          The aviation industry is highly regulated by the FAA in the United States and equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. Beforewe sell any of our products that are to be installed in an aircraft, such as 8 Table of Contentsengines,engine parts and components, and airframe and accessory parts and components, they must meet certain standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies incertain other countries. We operate repair stations that are licensed by the FAA and the equivalent regulatory agencies in certain other countries, and hold certificates to operate aircraft. Specificregulations vary from country to country, although regulatory requirements in other countries are generally satisfied by compliance with FAA requirements. New and more stringent governmentalregulations may be adopted in the future that, if enacted, may have an adverse impact on us.         Ifany of our material licenses, certificates, authorizations, or approvals were revoked or suspended by the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries, our results ofoperations and financial condition may be adversely affected.  If we fail to comply with complex procurement laws and regulations, we could lose business and be liable for various penalties or sanctions.          We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. government contracts. Theselaws and regulations include the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Truth in Negotiations Act, Cost Accounting Standards, and laws, regulations, and ordersrestricting the use and dissemination of classified information under the U.S. export control laws and the export of certain products and technical information. Certain government contracts provideaudit rights by government agencies, including with respect to performance, costs, internal controls and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In complying with these laws and regulations,we may incur significant costs, and non-compliance may result in the imposition of fines and penalties, including contractual damages. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or if agovernment audit, review, or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil penalties, criminal penalties, or administrative sanctions, including debarment fromcontracting with the U.S. Government. Our reputation could suffer harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, which could adversely affect our operating performance and may result inadditional expenses and possible loss of revenue.  The majority of our expeditionary airlift revenue is derived from providing expeditionary airlift services in Afghanistan.          Our expeditionary airlift business derives most of its revenue from providing supplemental expeditionary airlift services inAfghanistan for the DoD. The U.S. has announced plans to reduce military activities in Afghanistan in 2014 and expects to end the calendar year with fewer than 10,000 U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Ourrevenue from our expeditionary airlift business in Afghanistan depends in part on the execution of a status of forces agreement between the U.S. and the Afghan governments that would establish theframework under which U.S. military personnel operate in Afghanistan and how Afghan laws apply toward U.S. personnel, including our employees and contractors. Without a status of forces agreement, ouractivities and associated revenues in Afghanistan may be substantially reduced or even eliminated. The negotiation of the status of forces agreement has been deferred by the Afghan government pendingthe outcome of their Presidential election.         Weare also bidding on expeditionary airlift contracts supporting both DoD and non-DoD customers, although there can be no assurance we will be awarded any of these contracts. At thebeginning of fiscal year 2014 we had 40 aircraft in revenue service. By the end of fiscal year 2014, 20 of those aircraft were no longer in active service and were available for future missiondeployment.         Althoughwe expect ongoing demand for expeditionary airlift services in Afghanistan from the DoD and other governmental departments, we are exposed to the risk that our expeditionaryairlift revenues may decline if contracts are not renewed, renewed only in part, or are terminated, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. If we are unable tosuccessfully redeploy our 9 Table of Contentsexistingaircraft at favorable rates or sell them on favorable terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.         U.S.government contractors that provide support services in theaters of conflict such as Afghanistan have come under increasing scrutiny by agency inspectors general, governmentauditors and congressional committees. Investigations pursued by any or all of these groups may result in adverse publicity for us and reputational harm, regardless of the underlying merit of theallegations being investigated.  We are exposed to risks associated with operating internationally.          We conduct our business in certain foreign countries, some of which are politically unstable or subject to military or civil conflicts.Consequently, we are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following: military conflicts, civil strife, and political risks;  export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;   compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws;   the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws, treaties, and technical standards and changes in those regulations;   contract award and funding delays;  potential restrictions on transfers of funds;  import and export duties and value added taxes;  foreign exchange risk;  transportation delays and interruptions; and  uncertainties arising from foreign local business practices and cultural considerations.         Whilewe have and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of doing business internationally, we cannot ensure that such measureswill be adequate or that the regions in which we operate will continue to be stable enough to allow us to operate profitably or at all.  Acquisitions expose us to risks, including the risk that we may be unable to effectively integrate acquired businesses.          We continue to grow through acquisitions. We explore and have discussions with third parties regarding additional acquisitions on aregular basis. Acquisitions involve risks, including difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel, the effects of amortization of any acquired intangible assets and the potentialimpairment of goodwill, and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired business. In addition, acquisitions often require substantial management resources and have the potential to divert ourattention from our existing business. For our recent acquisitions, and for any businesses we may acquire in the future, we may not be able to execute our operational, financial, or integration plansfor the acquired businesses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Market values for our aviation products fluctuate, and we may be unable to re-lease or sell aircraft and engines when their current lease expires.          We use a number of assumptions when determining the recoverability of inventories, aircraft, and engines, which are on lease oravailable for lease. These assumptions include historical sales trends, current and expected usage trends, replacement values, current and expected lease rates, residual values, future demand, andfuture cash flows. Reductions in demand for our inventories or declining market 10 Table of Contentsvalues,as well as differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining the recoverability of our inventories, aircraft, and engines, could result in impairmentcharges in future periods, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.         Welease aircraft and engines to our customers on an operating lease basis. Our ability to re-lease or sell these assets on acceptable terms when the lease expires is subject to a numberof factors which drive industry capacity, including new aircraft deliveries, availability of used aircraft and engines in the marketplace, competition, financial condition of our customers, overallhealth of the airline industry, and general economic conditions. Our inability to re-lease or sell aircraft and engines could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We may need to reduce the carrying value of our assets.          We own a significant amount of aircraft, aircraft parts and components, and manufacturing facilities and related equipment. The removalof aircraft from service or recurring losses in certain operations could require us to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of those assets and record an impairment charge throughearnings to reduce the carrying value.         Wehave recorded goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions. If we are unable to achieve the projected levels of operating results, it may be necessary to record animpairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and related intangible assets. Similarly, if we were to lose a key customer or one of our airframe maintenance or landing gear facilitieswere to lose their authority to operate, it could be necessary to record an impairment charge.  We are dependent upon continued availability of financing to manage our business and to execute our business strategy, and additional financing may not be available on termsacceptable to us.          Our ability to manage our business and to execute our business strategy is dependent, in part, on the continued availability of debtand equity capital. Access to the debt and equity capital markets may be limited by various factors, including the condition of overall credit markets, general economic factors, state of the aviationindustry, our financial performance, and creditratings. Debt and equity capital may not continue to be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms could adversely affect our results ofoperations and financial condition.  Our existing debt includes restrictive and financial covenants.          Certain loan and debt agreements require us to comply with various restrictive covenants and some contain financial covenants thatrequire us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests. Our failure to meet these covenants could result in default under these loan and debt agreements and may result in a cross-default underother debt agreements. In the event of a default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amounts outstanding under our debt agreements could be declared immediately due and payable.Our failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Our industry is susceptible to product and other liability claims, and claims not adequately covered by insurance may adversely affect our financial condition.          Our business exposes us to possible claims for property damage and bodily injury or death which may result if an engine, engine part orcomponent, airframe part or accessory, or any other aviation product which we have sold, manufactured, or repaired fails, or if an aircraft we operated, serviced, or in which our products areinstalled crashes and the cause cannot be determined. We carry substantial liability insurance in amounts that we believe are adequate for our risk exposure and commensurate with industry norms.However, claims may arise in the future, and our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us in all circumstances. Additionally, we might not be able to maintain adequate insurance coveragein the 11 Table of Contentsfutureat an acceptable cost. Any liability claim not covered by adequate insurance could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Our business could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats or other disruptions.          Our businesses depend heavily on information technology and computerized systems to communicate and operate effectively. The Company'ssystems and technologies, or those of third parties on which we rely, could fail or become unreliable due to equipment failures, software viruses, cyber threats, terrorist acts, natural disasters,power failures or other causes. These threats arise in some cases as a result of our role as a defense contractor.         Cybersecurity threats are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to our sensitive information, including our customers,suppliers, subcontractors, and joint venture partners, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential orotherwise protected information, and corruption of data.         Althoughwe utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate these threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient to preventsecurity threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, the costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified and couldhave a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results, and financial condition.  We must comply with extensive environmental requirements, and any exposure to environmental liabilities may adversely affect us.          Federal, state, and local requirements relating to the discharge and emission of substances into the environment, the disposal ofhazardous wastes, the remediation and abatement of contaminants, and other activities affecting the environment have had and may continue to have an impact on our operations. Management cannot assessthe possible effect of compliance with future environmental requirements or of future environmental claims for which we may not have adequate indemnification or insurance coverage. If we were requiredto pay the expenses related to any future environmental claims for which neither indemnification nor insurance coverage were available, these expenses could have an adverse impact on our results ofoperations and financial condition.         Futureenvironmental regulatory developments in the United States and abroad concerning environmental issues, such as climate change, could adversely affect our operations and increaseoperating costs and, through their impact on our customers, reduce demand for our products and services. Actions may be taken in the future by the U.S. government, state governments within the UnitedStates, foreign governments, the International Civil Aviation Organization, or by signatory countries through a new global climate change treaty to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by theaviation industry. The precise nature of any such requirements and their applicability to us and ourcustomers are difficult to predict, but the impact to us and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant, including the potential for increased fuel costs, carbon taxes orfees, or a requirement to purchase carbon credits.  We may need to make significant capital expenditures to keep pace with technological developments in our industry.          The industries in which we participate are constantly undergoing development and change, and it is likely that new products, equipment,and methods of repair and overhaul services will be introduced in the future. We may need to make significant expenditures to purchase new equipment and to train our employees to keep pace with anynew technological developments. These expenditures could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 12 Table of Contents Our operations would be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled personnel or work stoppages.          We are dependent on an educated and highly skilled workforce, because of the complex nature of many of our products and services.Furthermore, we have a collective bargaining agreement covering approximately 130 employees. Our ability to operate successfully and meet our customers' demands could be jeopardized if we are unableto attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled personnel, including qualified licensed mechanics, to conduct our business, or if we experience a significant or prolonged work stoppage. These andsimilar events may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition"
13,AIR,AAR CORP,2013-07-26,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS             The following is a description of the principal risks inherent in our business.  We are affected by factors that adversely impact the commercial aviation industry.          As a provider of products and services to the commercial aviation industry, we are greatly affected by overall economic conditions ofthat industry. The commercial aviation industry is historically cyclical and has been negatively affected in the past by geopolitical events, high oil prices, lack of capital, and weak economicconditions. In addition, as a result of these and other events, from time-to-time certain of our customers have filed for bankruptcy protection or ceased operation.         Incalendar year 2008 and into 2009, demand for air transportation in the United States and abroad declined due to economic deterioration in the U.S. and other global economies. Althoughglobal economic conditions improved in the 2010 to 2013 period, the recovery has generally been sluggish in the U.S. and in many other developed nations. The impact of persistently high fuel costs andthe continued sluggish or weak worldwide economic conditions may lead airlines to reduce domestic or international capacity. In addition, certain of our airline customers have in the past beenimpacted by tight credit markets, which limited their ability to buy parts, services, engines, and aircraft.         Areduction in the operating fleet of aircraft both in the U.S. and abroad will result in reduced demand for parts support and maintenance activities for the type of aircraft affected.Further, tight credit conditions negatively impact the amount of liquidity available to buy parts, services, engines, and aircraft. A deteriorating airline environment may also result in additionalairline bankruptcies, and we may not be able to fully collect outstanding accounts receivable. Reduced demand from customers caused by weak economic conditions, including tight credit conditions andcustomer bankruptcies, may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.         Ourbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, and growth rates may be adversely affected by these and other events that impact the aviation industry, including thefollowing:deterioration in the financial condition of our existing and potential customers;  reductions in the need for, or the deferral of, aircraft maintenance and repair services and spare parts support;  retirement of older generation aircraft, resulting in lower prices for spare parts and services for those aircraft;  reductions in demand for used aircraft and engines; increased in-house maintenance by airlines; high oil prices; lack of parts in the marketplace; future terrorist attacks and the ongoing war on terrorism; future outbreaks of infectious diseases; and acts of God.  Our U.S. government contracts may not continue at present sales levels, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.          Our sales to branches, agencies and departments of the U.S. government and their contractors were $763.2 million (35.7% ofconsolidated sales) in fiscal year 2013 (See Note 16of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The majority of our U.S. government contracts is for products and services 6 Table of ContentssupportingU.S. Department of Defense logistics and mobility strategy, as well as for supplemental airlift services and are, therefore, subject to changes in defense and other governmental agencyfunding and spending. Our contracts with the U.S. government, including the Department of Defense and its contractors, are typically agreements to provide products and services at a fixed price andhave a term of one year or less, frequently subject to extension for one or more additional periods of one year at the option of the government customer. Sales to agencies of the U.S. government andtheir contractors are subject to a number of factors, including the level of troop deployment worldwide, competitive bidding, U.S. government funding, requirements generated by world events, andbudgetary constraints.         Defensefunding is currently facing pressure due to U.S. budget deficit challenges. Congress enacted the Budget Control Act of 2011 (""Budget Act""), which reduced defense spending by aminimum of $487 billion over a ten-year period that began in government fiscal year 2012. Considering the Budget Act and deficit reduction pressures, it is likely that discretionary spending bythe federal government will remain constrained for several years.         TheAmerican Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (""Taxpayer Relief Act"") delayed the pending sequestration of appropriations imposed by the Budget Act by two months, from January 2, 2013to March 1, 2013, and reduced the amount of the government fiscal year 2013 budget cuts. Sequestration went into effect March 1, 2013. On March 26, 2013, the President signed intolaw the Consolidated Further Continuing Appropriations Act, which includes specific appropriations for the U.S. Department of Defense. On April 10, 2013, the President delivered his proposedfiscal 2014 budget to Congress. The President's $527 billion fiscal 2014 defense budget is lower than the final defense appropriations for fiscal 2013.         Whilethe specific effects of sequestration still cannot be determined, the automatic across-the-board cuts would approximately double the amount of the ten-year $487 billionreduction in the U.S. government defense spending that began in government fiscal year 2012 already required by the Budget Act. At this time, we have no information from our defense customers orotherwise that would allow us to estimate the impact of sequestration on our defense sales; however, our government-related business could be adversely impacted if no legislative or other solution isreached in the near future and sequestration remains in effect for an extended period.  Acquisitions expose us to risks, including the risk that we may be unable to effectively integrate acquired businesses.          We continue to grow through acquisitions. We explore and have discussions with third parties regarding additional acquisitions on aregular basis. Acquisitions involve risks, including difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel, the effects of amortization of any acquired intangible assets and the potentialimpairment of goodwill, and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired business. For our recent acquisitions, and for any businesses we may acquire in the future, we may not be able toexecute our operational, financial, or integration plans for the acquired businesses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We face risks of cost overruns and losses on fixed-price contracts.          We sell certain of our products and services to our commercial, government, and defense customers under firm contracts providing forfixed unit prices, regardless of costs incurred by us. The cost of producing products or providing services may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, overhead, andother unknown variants, including manufacturing and other operational inefficiencies and differences between assumptions used by us to price a contract and actual results. Increased costs may resultin cost overruns and losses on such contracts, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 7 Table of Contents Significant cost issues may develop in connection with the A400M cargo system.          Our Cargo Systems unit was selected in June 2005 to provide cargo loading systems for the Airbus A400M Military Transport Aircraft(""A400M""). We have incurred significant engineering and development costs in connection with this program (see Note 15 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), and we expect to incuradditional costs until final design approval, which is currently scheduled for the first calendar quarter of 2014. In July 2013, we and Airbus amended the A400M contract to make changes to theCompany's role and responsibilities under the program, establish a fixed price per shipset, set applicable weight parameters and make certain other changes. The Company believes that the revised fixedpricing schedule will enable the Company to recover its engineering and development costs, provided the Company achieves specified reductions in the production costs of those items over which it hascontinuing responsibility.         Wemay not be able to recover our engineering and development costs, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, under certain circumstances, includingthe following: (i) the A400M program experiences significant additional delivery delays or order cancellations; (ii) we fail to achieve the expected production cost reductions;(iii) we fail to deliver the items that we are now responsible for in accordance with the terms of the amended contract; or (iv) the contract is further amended to change our role andresponsibilities.  Success at our airframe maintenance facilities is dependent upon continued outsourcing by the airlines.          We currently perform airframe maintenance, repair and overhaul activities at leased facilities in Indianapolis, Indiana; Oklahoma City,Oklahoma; Miami, Florida; Duluth, Minnesota; and Hot Springs, Arkansas. Revenues at these facilities fluctuate based on demand for maintenance which, in turn, is driven by the number of aircraftoperating and the extent of outsourcing of maintenance activities by airlines. If either the number of aircraft operating or the level of outsourcing of maintenance activities declines, we may not beable to execute our operational and financial plans at our maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We operate in highly competitive markets, and competitive pressures may adversely affect us.          The markets for our products and services to our commercial, government, and defense customers are highly competitive, and we facecompetition from a number of sources, both domestic and international. Our competitors include aircraft manufacturers, aircraft component and parts manufacturers, airline and aircraft servicecompanies, other companies providing maintenance, repair and overhaul services, other aircraft spare parts distributors and redistributors, and other expeditionary airlift service providers. Some ofour competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and others may price their products and services below our selling prices. These competitive pressures couldadversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We are subject to significant government regulation and may need to incur significant expenses to comply with new or more stringent governmental regulation.          The aviation industry is highly regulated by the FAA in the United States and equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. Beforewe sell any of our products that are to beinstalled in an aircraft, such as engines, engine parts and components, and airframe and accessory parts and components, they must meet certain standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or theequivalent regulatory agencies in certain other countries. We operate repair stations that are licensed by the FAA and the equivalent regulatory agencies in certain other countries, and holdcertificates to operate aircraft. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although regulatory requirements in other countries are generally satisfied by compliance with FAA requirements.New and more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted in the future that, if enacted, may have an adverse impact on us. 8 Table of Contents        Ifany of our material licenses, certificates, authorizations, or approvals were revoked or suspended by the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries, our results ofoperations and financial condition may be adversely affected.  If we fail to comply with complex procurement laws and regulations, we could lose business and be liable for various penalties or sanctions.          We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. government contracts. Theselaws and regulations include the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Truth in Negotiations Act, Cost Accounting Standards, and laws, regulations, and ordersrestricting the use and dissemination of classified information under the U.S. export control laws and the export of certain products and technical information. In complying with these laws andregulations, we may incur significant costs, and non-compliance may result in the imposition of fines and penalties, including contractual damages. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulationsor if a government audit, review, or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil penalties, criminal penalties, or administrative sanctions, including debarmentfrom contracting with the U.S. Government. Our reputation could suffer harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, which could adversely affect our operating performance and may result inadditional expenses and possible loss of revenue.  The majority of Airlift's revenue is derived from providing expeditionary airlift services in Afghanistan.          Airlift derives most of its revenue from providing supplemental airlift services in Afghanistan for the U.S. Department of Defense. TheU.S. has announced plans to reduce substantially military activities in Afghanistan in 2014 and withdraw the majority of its troops, althoughthe timing and number of troops to be withdrawn is not precisely known. Airlift has contracts with option renewals in October 2013 and May 2014 with an aggregate annual sales value of approximately$220 million. In addition, Airlift has a contract expiring on November 30, 2013 with an annual sales value of $110 million. Although we expect significant ongoing demand forairlift services in Afghanistan from the U.S. Department of Defense and other governmental departments, we are exposed to the risk that our revenues at Airlift may decline if these contracts are notrenewed, renewed only in part, or are terminated, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Airlift's inability to diversify its customer base beyond the U.S.Department of Defense in Afghanistan could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.         U.S.government contractors that provide support services in theaters of conflict such as Afghanistan have come under increasing scrutiny by agency inspectors general government auditorsand congressional committees. Investigations pursued by any or all of these groups may result in adverse publicity for us and reputational harm, regardless of the underlying merit of the allegationsbeing investigated.  We are exposed to risks associated with operating internationally.          We conduct our business in certain foreign countries, some of which are politically unstable or subject to military or civil conflicts.Consequently, we are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following:military conflicts, civil strife, and political risks; export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;  compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws;  the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws, treaties, and technical standards and changes in those regulations; 9 Table of Contentscontract award and funding delays; potential restrictions on transfers of funds; import and export duties and value added taxes; foreign exchange risk; transportation delays and interruptions; and uncertainties arising from foreign local business practices and cultural considerations.         Whilewe have and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of doing business internationally, we cannot ensure that such measureswill be adequate or that the regions in which we operate will continue to be stable enough to allow us to operate profitably or at all.  Market values for our aviation products fluctuate, and we may be unable to re-lease or sell aircraft and engines when their current lease expires.          We use a number of assumptions when determining the recoverability of inventories, aircraft, and engines, which are on lease oravailable for lease. These assumptions include historical sales trends, current and expected usage trends, replacement values, current and expected lease rates, residual values, future demand, andfuture cash flows. Reductions in demand for our inventories or declining market values, as well as differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining therecoverability of our inventories, aircraft, and engines, could result in impairment charges in future periods.         Welease aircraft and engines to our customers on an operating lease basis. Our ability to re-lease or sell these assets on acceptable terms when the lease expires is subject to a numberof factors which drive industry capacity, including new aircraft deliveries, availability of used aircraft and engines in the marketplace, competition, financial condition of our customers, overallhealth of the airline industry, and general economic conditions. Our inability to re-lease or sell aircraft and engines could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We are dependent upon continued availability of financing to manage our business and to execute our business strategy, and additional financing may not be available on termsacceptable to us.          Our ability to manage our business and to execute our business strategy is dependent, in part, on the continued availability of debtand equity capital. Access to the debt and equity capital markets may be limited by various factors, including the condition of overall credit markets, general economic factors, state of the aviationindustry, our financial performance, and credit ratings. Debt and equity capital may not continue to be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Our inability to obtain financing on favorableterms could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Our existing debt includes restrictive and financial covenants.          Certain loan and debt agreements require us to comply with various restrictive covenants and some contain financial covenants thatrequire us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests. Our failure to meet these covenants could result in default under these loan and debt agreements and may result in a cross-default underother debt agreements. In the event of a default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amounts outstanding under our debt agreements could be declared immediately due and payable.Our failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 10 Table of Contents Our industry is susceptible to product and other liability claims, and claims not adequately covered by insurance may adversely affect our financial condition.          Our business exposes us to possible claims for property damage and bodily injury or death which may result if an engine, engine part orcomponent, airframe part or accessory, or any other aviation product which we have sold, manufactured, or repaired fails, or if an aircraft we operated, serviced, or in which our products areinstalled crashes and the cause cannot be determined. We carry substantial liability insurance in amounts that we believe are adequate for our risk exposure and commensurate with industry norms.However, claims may arise in the future, and our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us in all circumstances. Additionally, we might not be able to maintain adequate insurance coveragein the future at an acceptable cost. Any liability claim not covered by adequate insurance could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Our business could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats or other disruptions.          We face cyber threats, threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees, and terrorist acts, as well as the potentialfor business disruptions associated with information technology failures, natural disasters, or public health crises. These threats arise in some cases as a result of our role as a defense contractor.         Cybersecurity threats are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to our sensitive information, including our customers,suppliers, subcontractors, and joint venture partners, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential orotherwise protected information, and corruption of data.         Althoughwe utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate these threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient to preventsecurity threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, the costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified and couldhave a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results, and financial condition.  We must comply with extensive environmental requirements, and any exposure to environmental liabilities may adversely affect us.          Federal, state, and local requirements relating to the discharge and emission of substances into the environment, the disposal ofhazardous wastes, the remediation and abatement of contaminants, and other activities affecting the environment have had and may continue to have an impact on our operations. Management cannot assessthe possible effect of compliance with future environmental requirements or of future environmental claims for which we may not have adequate indemnification or insurance coverage. If we were requiredto pay the expenses related to any future environmental claims for which neither indemnification nor insurance coverage were available, these expenses could have an adverse impact on our results ofoperations and financial condition.         Futureenvironmental regulatory developments in the United States and abroad concerning environmental issues, such as climate change, could adversely affect our operations and increaseoperating costs and, through their impact on our customers, reduce demand for our products and services. Actions may be taken in the future by the U.S. government, state governments within the UnitedStates, foreign governments, the International Civil Aviation Organization, or by signatory countries through a new global climate change treaty to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by theaviation industry. The precise nature of any such requirements and their applicability to us and our customers are difficult to predict, but the impact to us and the aviation industry would likely beadverse and could be significant, including the potential for increased fuel costs, carbon taxes or fees, or a requirement to purchase carbon credits. 11 Table of Contents We may need to make significant capital expenditures to keep pace with technological developments in our industry.          The industries in which we participate are constantly undergoing development and change, and it is likely that new products, equipment,and methods of repair and overhaul services will be introduced in the future. We may need to make significant expenditures to purchase new equipment and to train our employees to keep pace with anynew technological developments. These expenditures could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Our operations would be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled personnel or work stoppages.          We are dependent on an educated and highly skilled workforce, because of the complex nature of many of our products and services.Furthermore, we have a collective bargaining agreement covering approximately 230 employees. Our ability to operate successfully and meet our customers' demands could be jeopardized if we are unableto attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled personnel, including qualified licensed mechanics, to conduct our business, or if we experience a significant or prolonged work stoppage. These andsimilar events may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition"
10,AIR,AAR CORP,2011-07-13,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS             The following is a description of the principal risks inherent in our business.  We are affected by factors that adversely impact the commercial aviation industry.          As a provider of products and services to the commercial aviation industry, we are greatly affected by overall economic conditions ofthat industry. The commercial aviation industry is historically cyclical and has been negatively affected in the past by geopolitical events, high oil prices, lack of capital and weak economicconditions. In addition, as a result of these and other events, from time-to-time certain of our customers have filed for bankruptcy protection or ceased operation.         Incalendar year 2008 and into 2009, demand for air transportation in the United States and abroad declined due to economic deterioration in the U.S. and other global economies. Althoughglobal economic conditions improved in 2010 and 2011, the recovery has generally been sluggish in the U.S., and in many other developed nations. The impact of high fuel costs and the continuedsluggish or weak world-wide economic conditions, may lead airlines to reduce domestic or international capacity. In addition, certain of our airline customers have in the past beenimpacted by tight credit markets, which has limited their ability to buy parts, services, engines and aircraft.         Afurther reduction in the operating fleet of aircraft both in the U.S. and abroad will result in reduced demand for parts support and maintenance activities for the type of aircraftaffected. Further, tight credit conditions may impact the amount of liquidity available to buy parts, services, engines and aircraft. A deteriorating airline environment may also result in airlinebankruptcies, and we may not be able to fully collect outstanding accounts receivable. Reduced demand from customers caused by weak economic conditions, including tight credit conditions and customerbankruptcies, may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.         Ourbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and growth rates may be adversely affected by these and other events that impact the aviation industry, including thefollowing: deterioration in the financial condition of our existing and potential customers;   reductions in the need for, or the deferral of, aircraft maintenance and repair services and spare parts support;  retirement of older generation aircraft, resulting in lower prices for spare parts and services for those aircraft;  reductions in demand for used aircraft and engines;   increased in-house maintenance by airlines;   high oil prices;   future terrorist attacks and the ongoing war on terrorism;   future outbreaks of infectious diseases; and   acts of God.  Our government contracts may not continue at present sales levels, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.          Our sales to branches, agencies and departments of the U.S. government and their contractors were $893,017 (50.3% of consolidatedsales) in fiscal year 2011 (See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The majority of our U.S. government contracts are for products and services used for ongoing militaryperformance-based logistics support activities, products which support the U.S. military's 7 Table of Contentsdeploymentstrategy, and expeditionary airlift services in support of military deployments. Our contracts with the U.S. government, including the Department of Defense and its contractors, aretypically firm agreements to provide products and services at a fixed price and have a term of one year or less, frequently subject to extension for one or more additional periods of one year at theoption of the government customer. Sales to agencies of the U.S. government and their contractors are subject to a number of factors, including the level of troop deployment worldwide, competitivebidding, U.S. government funding requirements generated by world events, and budgetary constraints. Therefore, such sales may not continue at levels previously experienced. While spendingauthorizations for intelligence and defense-related programs by the U.S. government have increased in recent years, in particular after the 2001 terrorist attacks and as a result of action in supportof military and civil activity in Afghanistan and Iraq, future levels of expenditure, mission priorities and authorizations for these programs may decrease, which could have an adverse effect on ourresults of operations and financial condition.  Market values for our aviation products fluctuate and we may be unable to re-lease or sell aircraft and engines when their current lease expires.          We use a number of assumptions when determining the recoverability of inventories and aircraft and engines which are on lease oravailable for lease. These assumptions include historical sales trends, current and expected usage trends, replacement values, current and expected lease rates, residual values, future demand, andfuture cash flows. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we decided to offer one narrow body aircraft for sale from our wholly-owned aircraft portfolio and as a result, we recorded a $5,355pre-tax impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the aircraft to it is net realizable value. During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we performed a comprehensive review of ouraircraft portfolio. The primary objective of this review was to assess the impact of the economic slowdown and credit crisis on market conditions. Based upon that review, we recorded a $21,033pre-tax impairment charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 to reduce the carrying value of three aircraft to their net realizable value. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, werecorded a $10,100 pre-tax impairment charge on inventory and engines which had been acquired prior to September 11, 2001. This inventory was also subject to impairment chargesrecorded in previous fiscal years. The fiscal 2009 inventory and engine impairment charges were triggered by declining conditions in the commercial aviation industry and a slowdown inthe sales volume of these assets during the fiscal year. Further reductions in demand for our inventories or declining market values, as well as differences between actual results and the assumptionsutilized by us when determining the recoverability of our inventories, aircraft and engines, could result in additional impairment charges in future periods. We can give no assurance that futureimpairment charges for our inventories, aircraft and engines will not occur.         Welease aircraft and engines to our customers on an operating lease basis. Our ability to re-lease or sell these assets on acceptable terms when the lease expires is subjectto a number of factors which drive industry capacity, including new aircraft deliveries, availability of used aircraft and engines in the marketplace, competition, financial condition of ourcustomers, overall health of the airline industry and general economic conditions. During fiscal 2012, ten 737-400's and one 737-300 in the joint venture portfolio and one MD80in the wholly owned portfolio will be up for lease renewal. Our inability to re-lease these aircraft, or other aircraft and engines that are currently on lease, could adversely affect ourresults of operations and financial condition.  Acquisitions expose us to risks, including the risk that we may be unable to effectively integrate acquired businesses.          We continue to grow through acquisitions, including most recently with the acquisition of Airlift in April 2010, the largestacquisition in the Company's history. Further, we explore and have discussions with third parties regarding additional acquisitions on a regular basis. Acquisitions involve risks, includingdifficulties in integrating the operations and personnel, the effects of amortization of any acquired intangible assets and the potential impairment of goodwill, and the potential loss of keyemployees of the 8 Table of Contentsacquiredbusiness. For our recent acquisitions, and for any businesses we may acquire in the future, we may not be able to execute our operational, financial or integration plans for the acquiredbusinesses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We face risks of cost overruns and losses on fixed-price contracts.          We sell certain of our products and services to our commercial, government and defense customers under firm contracts providing forfixed prices, regardless of costs incurred by us. The cost of producing products or providing services may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, overhead and otherunknown variants, including manufacturing and other operational inefficiencies and differences between assumptions used by us toprice a contract and actual results. Increased costs may result in cost overruns and losses on such contracts, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Significant cost issues may develop in connection with the A400M Cargo system.          In June 2005, we announced that our Cargo Systems business in our Structures and Systems segment was selected to provide cargo handlingsystems for the new Airbus A400M Military Transport Aircraft (""A400M""). We have incurred, and are expected to continue to incur, significant development costs in connection with this program (seeNote 14 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our portion of revenue to be generated from this program is expected to exceed $300 million through fiscal 2020, based on currentsales projections for the A400M as provided to us by Airbus. Based on program delays and information provided by Airbus, planned first shipments under this program have slipped to fiscal 2013. If theA400M experiences significant additional delivery delays or order cancellations, or if we fail to develop the system according to contract specifications, then we may not be able to recover ourdevelopment costs, and our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.  Success within our Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul segment is dependent upon continued outsourcing by the airlines.          We currently perform airframe maintenance, repair and overhaul activities at leased facilities in Indianapolis, Indiana; Oklahoma City,Oklahoma; Miami, Florida; and Hot Springs, Arkansas. Revenues at these facilities fluctuate based on demand for maintenance which, in turn, is driven by the number of aircraft operating and the extentof outsourcing of maintenance activities by airlines. If either the number of aircraft operating or the level of outsourcing of maintenance activities declines, we may not be able to execute ouroperational and financial plans at our MRO facilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We operate in highly competitive markets, and competitive pressures may adversely affect us.          The markets for our products and services to our commercial, government and defense customers are highly competitive, and we facecompetition from a number of sources, both domestic and international. Our competitors include aircraft and aircraft component and parts manufacturers, airline and aircraft service companies, othercompanies providing maintenance, repair and overhaul services, other aircraft spare parts distributors and redistributors, and other expeditionary airlift service providers. Some of our competitorshave substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and others may price their products and services below our selling prices. These competitive pressures could adversely affect ourresults of operations and financial condition. 9 Table of Contents We are subject to significant government regulation and may need to incur significant expenses to comply with new or more stringent governmental regulation.          The aviation industry is highly regulated by the FAA in the United States and equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. Beforewe sell any of our products that are to be installed in an aircraft, such as engines, engine parts and components, and airframe and accessory parts and components, they must meet certain standards ofairworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in certain other countries. We operate repair stations that are licensed by the FAA and the equivalent regulatory agencies incertain other countries, and hold certificates to operate aircraft. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although regulatory requirements in other countries are generally satisfied bycompliance with FAA requirements. New and more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted in the future that, if enacted, may have an adverse impact on us.         Ifany of the Company's material licenses, certificates, authorizations or approvals were revoked or suspended by the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries, ourresults of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.  If we fail to comply with complex procurement laws and regulations, we could lose business and be liable for various penalties or sanctions.          We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. Theselaws and regulations include the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the Truth in Negotiations Act, Cost Accounting Standards, and laws, regulations and orders restricting the use and dissemination ofclassified information under U.S. export control laws, and the export of certain products and technical information. In complying with these laws and regulations, we may incur significant costs, andnon-compliance may result in the imposition of fines and penalties, including contractual damages. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or if a government audit, review orinvestigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions. Our reputation could suffer harm if allegations of impropriety weremade against us, which could adversely affect our operating performance and may result in additional expenses and possible loss of revenue.  The majority of Airlift's revenue is derived from providing expeditionary airlift services in Afghanistan.          Airlift derives most of its revenue from providing supplemental airlift in Afghanistan for the U.S. Department of Defense. ThePresident of the United States recently affirmed plans for troop withdrawals in Afghanistan beginning in calendar year 2011, and then accelerating in mid-to-late calendar year2012. Although we expect significant on-going demand for airlift services in Afghanistan from the Department of Defense and other governmental departments, we are exposed to the risk thatour revenues at Airlift may decline, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.         U.S.government contractors that provide support services in theaters of conflict such as Afghanistan have come under increasing scrutiny by agency inspector generals, governmentauditors and congressional committees. Investigations pursued by any or all of these groups may result in adverse publicity for us and reputational harm, regardless of the underlying merit of theallegations being investigated.         Inaddition, in connection with our acquisition of Airlift, we entered into a consent agreement with the U.S. Department of State, Office of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, toresolve certain violations of export control laws that occurred prior to our acquisition. Under the consent agreement, we agreed to take certain measures to enhance Airlift's export compliance programand appointed an internal special compliance official to oversee Airlift's continuing assessment, improvement and adoption of enhancements to its compliance program. If during the eighteen-month termof the consent agreement, the government determines we have failed to comply with the terms of the consent agreement ending in 10 Table of ContentsJanuary2012, we or one of our subsidiaries may face sanctions, which could include debarment from participating in contracts with the U.S. government.  We are exposed to risks associated with operating internationally.          We conduct our business in certain foreign countries, some of which are politically unstable or subject to military or civil conflicts.Consequently, we are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following: military conflicts, civil strife and political risks;   export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;   compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;   the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws, treaties and technical standards and changes in those regulations;  contract award and funding delays;   potential restrictions on transfers of funds;   import and export duties and value added taxes;   transportation delays and interruptions;   uncertainties arising from foreign local business practices and cultural considerations.         Whilewe have and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of doing business internationally, we cannot ensure that such measureswill be adequate. There can be no assurances that the regions in which we operate will continue to be stable enough to allow us to operate profitably or at all.  We are dependent upon the continued availability of financing to manage our business and to execute our business strategy, and additional financing may not be available onterms acceptable to us.          Our ability to manage our business and to execute our business strategy is dependent, in part, on the continued availability of debtand equity capital. Access to the debt and equity capital markets may be limited by various factors, including the condition of overall credit markets, general economic factors, the state of theaviation industry, our financial performance and credit ratings. Debt and equity capital may not continue to be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Our inability to obtain financing onfavorable terms could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Our existing debt includes restrictive and financial covenants.          Certain of our loan agreements require us to comply with various restrictive covenants and some contain financial covenants thatrequire us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests. Our failure to meet these covenants could result in default under these loan agreements and would result in a cross-default under otherloan agreements. In the event of a default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amounts outstanding under loan agreements could be declared immediately due and payable. Our failureto comply with these covenants could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Our industry is susceptible to product and other liability claims, and claims not adequately covered by insurance may adversely affect our financial condition.          Our business exposes us to possible claims for property damage and personal injury or death which may result if an engine, engine partor component, airframe part or accessory or any other aviation product 11 Table of Contentswhichwe have sold, manufactured or repaired fails, or if an aircraft we operated, serviced or in which our products are installed crashes and the cause cannot be determined. We carry substantialliability insurance in amounts that we believe are adequate for our risk exposure and commensurate with industry norms. However, claims may arise in the future, and our insurance coverage may not beadequate to protect us in all circumstances. Additionally, we might not be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Any liability claim not covered by adequateinsurance could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We must comply with extensive environmental requirements, and any exposure to environmental liabilities may adversely affect us.          Federal, state and local requirements relating to the discharge and emission of substances into the environment, the disposal ofhazardous wastes, the remediation and abatement of contaminants, and other activities affecting the environment have had and may continue to have an impact on our operations. Management cannot assessthe possible effect of compliance with future environmental requirements or of future environmental claims for which we may not have adequate indemnification or insurance coverage. If we were requiredto pay the expenses related to any future environmental claims for which neither indemnification nor insurance coverage were available, these expenses could have an adverse impact on our results ofoperations and financial condition.         Futureenvironmental regulatory developments in the United States and abroad concerning issues such as climate change, could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs and,through their impact on our customers, reduce demand. Actions may be taken in the future by the U.S. government, state governments within the United States, foreign governments, the InternationalCivil Aviation Organization, or by signatory countries through a new global climate change treaty to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry. The precise nature of any suchrequirements and their applicability to us and our customers are difficult to predict, but the impact to us and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant, including thepotential for increased fuel costs, carbon taxes or fees, or a requirement to purchase carbon credits.  We may need to make significant capital expenditures to keep pace with technological developments in our industry.          The industries in which we participate in are constantly undergoing development and change, and it is likely that new products,equipment and methods of repair and overhaul services will be introduced in the future. We may need to make significant expenditures to purchase new equipment and to train our employees to keep pacewith any new technological developments. These expenditures could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Our operations would be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled personnel or work stoppages.          Because of the complex nature of many of our products and services, we are dependent on an educated and highly skilled workforce.Furthermore, we have a collective bargaining agreement covering 487 employees. Our ability to operate successfully and meet our customers' demands could be jeopardized if we are unable to attract andretain a sufficient number of skilled personnel, including qualified licensed mechanics, to conduct our business, or if we experience a significant or prolonged work stoppage, and may adversely affectour results of operations and financial condition. 12 Table of Contents"
7,AIR,AAR CORP,2010-07-16,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS             The following is a description of the principal risks inherent in our business.  We are affected by factors that adversely affect the commercial aviation industry.          As a provider of products and services to the commercial aviation industry, we are greatly affected by overall economic conditions ofthat industry. The commercial aviation industry is historically cyclical and has been negatively affected during the past decade by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the subsequentdecline in air travel, the war on terrorism, the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, and historically high oil prices. As a result of these and other events, certain customersfiled for bankruptcy protection over the past several years, and others may be forced to do so in the future.         Morerecently, demand for air transportation in the United States and abroad has decreased due to adverse changes and deterioration in the U.S. and other global economies. While someeconomic indicators, like the U.S. GDP, have shown growth, other economic indicators that affect air travel, such as unemployment, have not yet begun to recover. Continued sluggish or weakworld-wide economic conditions may lead airlines to further reduce domestic or international capacity. In addition, certain of our airline customers have been impacted by tight creditmarkets, which has limited their ability to buy parts, services, engines and aircraft.         Afurther reduction in the operating fleet of aircraft both in the U.S. and abroad will result in reduced demand for parts support and maintenance activities for the type of aircraftaffected. Further, tight credit conditions may impact the amount of liquidity available to buy parts, services, engines and aircraft. Reduced demand from customers caused by weak economic conditions,including tight credit conditions, may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.         Ourbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and growth rates may be adversely affected by these and other events that impact the aviation industry, including thefollowing: deterioration in the financial condition of our existing and potential customers;   reductions in the need for, or the deferral of, aircraft maintenance and repair services and spare parts support;  retirement of older generation aircraft, resulting in lower prices for spare parts and services for those aircraft;  reductions in demand for used aircraft and engines;   increased in-house maintenance by airlines;   high oil prices;   future terrorist attacks and the ongoing war on terrorism; and   future outbreaks of infectious diseases.  Our customers may not be able to meet their financial obligations to us or we may experience less business as a result of the current airline environment, which wouldadversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.          Certain of our existing and prospective worldwide airline customers continue to suffer from problems affecting the aviation industry,and some have filed for bankruptcy protection. As a result, we may sell fewer parts and services to these customers and certain of these customers continue to pose credit risks to us. Our inability tocollect outstanding accounts receivable from one or more important customers would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 8 Table of Contents        Since2005, Mesa Air Group, Inc. (""Mesa"") has been a significant customer of the Company. During fiscal 2010, total sales to Mesa were $63,500, of which $38,800 was in theAviation Supply Chain segment (of which approximately $23,000 related to the ERJ 145 and CRJ 200 aircraft) and $24,700 was in the Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul segment (of which approximately$11,000 related to the ERJ 145 and CRJ 200 aircraft). In November 2009, AAR and Mesa amended their parts supply and maintenance agreements for the ERJ 145 and CRJ 200 aircraft types to provide Mesawith increased flexibility to respond to demand fluctuations in the 50-seat aircraft market.         OnJanuary 5, 2010, Mesa and subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. As a result, we wrote off certainpre-petition accounts receivable due from Mesa.         Basedupon our understanding of Mesa's requirements and subject to its restructuring plan, we expect future annual sales to Mesa to approximate $30,000 to $35,000. At May 31,2010, we had long-term assets recorded in equipment on long-term lease of $38,600 supporting the Mesa supply chain programs. At May 31, 2010, we also hadpost-petition trade accounts receivable and other assets associated with Mesa of approximately $6,200. If Mesa significantly reduces or eliminates a portion of its remaining aircraftfleet, or if Mesa is not able toemerge from its bankruptcy proceedings, our results of operations and financial position could be negatively affected.  Market values for our aviation products fluctuate.          We use a number of assumptions when determining the recoverability of inventories and aircraft and engines which are on lease oravailable for lease. These assumptions include historical sales trends, current and expected usage trends, replacement values, current and expected lease rates, residual values, future demand, andfuture cash flows. During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we performed a comprehensive review of our aircraft portfolio. The primary objective of this review was to assess the impact of theeconomic slowdown and credit crisis on market conditions. Based upon that review, we recorded a $21,033 pre-tax impairment charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 to reduce thecarrying value of three aircraft to their net realizable value. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded a $10,100 pre-tax impairment charge on inventory and engines which hadbeen acquired prior to September 11, 2001. This inventory was also subject to impairment charges recorded in previous fiscal years. The fiscal 2009 inventory and engine impairment charges weretriggered by declining conditions in the commercial aviation industry and a slowdown in the sales volume of these assets during the fiscal year. Further reductions in demand for our inventories ordeclining market values, as well as differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining the recoverability of our inventories, aircraft and engines, could result inadditional impairment charges in future periods. We can give no assurance that future impairment charges for our inventories, aircraft and engines will not occur.  Acquisitions expose us to risks, including the risk that we may be unable to effectively integrate acquired businesses.          During fiscal 2008 and 2007, we completed four acquisitions. More recently, in April 2010, we acquired AWS. Further, we explore andhave discussions with third parties regarding additional acquisitions on a regular basis. Acquisitions involve risks, including difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel, the effects ofamortization of any acquired intangible assets and the potential impairment of goodwill, and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired business. For our recent acquisitions, and for anybusinesses we may acquire in the future, we may not be able to execute our operational, financial or integration plans for the acquired businesses, which could adversely affect our results ofoperations and financial condition. 9 Table of Contents We face risks of cost overruns and losses on fixed-price contracts.          We sell certain of our products and services to our commercial and government customers under firm contracts providing for fixedprices, regardless of costs incurred by us. The cost of producing products or providing services may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, overhead and otherunknown variants, including manufacturing and other operational inefficiencies and differences between assumptions used by us to price a contract and actual results. Increased costs may result in costoverruns and losses on such contracts, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We may be unable to re-lease or sell aircraft and engines when their current leases expire.          We lease aircraft and engines to our customers on an operating lease basis. Our ability to re-lease or sell these assets onacceptable terms when the lease expires is subject to a number of factors which drive industry capacity, including new aircraft deliveries, availability of used aircraft and engines in themarketplace, competition, financial condition of our customers, overall health of the airline industry and general economic conditions. During fiscal 2011, five 737-400's and two737-300's in the joint venture portfolio and one MD80 in the wholly owned portfolio will be up for lease renewal. Our inability to re-lease these aircraft, or other aircraftand engines that are currently on lease, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Significant cost issues may develop in connection with the A400M Cargo system.          In June 2005, we announced that our Cargo Systems business in our Structures and Systems segment was selected to provide cargo handlingsystems for the new A400M Military Transport Aircraft (""A400M""). We are a subcontractor to Pfalz Flugzeugwerke GmbH (""PFW"") of Speyer, Germany on this Airbus program. We have incurred, and areexpected to continue to incur, significant development costs in connection with this program (see Note 13 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our portion of revenue to be generatedfrom this program is expected to exceed $300 million through fiscal 2020, based on current sales projections for the A400M as provided to us by Airbus. Based on program delays and informationprovided by Airbus, planned first shipments under this program have slipped to fiscal 2013. If the A400M experiences significant additional delivery delays or order cancellations, or if we fail todevelop the system according to contract specifications, then we may not be able to recover our development costs, and our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.  Success within our Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul segment is dependent upon continued outsourcing by the airlines.          We currently conduct airframe maintenance, repair and overhaul activities at leased facilities in Indianapolis, Indiana; Oklahoma City,Oklahoma; Miami, Florida; and Hot Springs, Arkansas. Revenues at these facilities fluctuate based on demand for maintenance which, in turn, is driven by the number of aircraft operating and the extentof outsourcing of maintenance activities by airlines. If either the number of aircraft operating or the level of outsourcing of maintenance activities decline, we may not be able to execute ouroperational and financial plans at our MRO facilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We operate in highly competitive markets, and competitive pressures may adversely affect us.          The aviation industry and the markets for our products and services to our government and defense customers are highly competitive, andwe face competition from a number of sources, both domestic and international. Our competitors include aircraft and aircraft component and parts manufacturers, airline and aircraft service companies,other companies providing maintenance, repair and overhaul services, other aircraft spare parts distributors and redistributors, and other expeditionary airlift service providers. 10 Table of ContentsSomeof our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and others may price their products and services below our selling prices. These competitive pressurescould adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We are subject to significant government regulation and may need to incur significant expenses to comply with new or more stringent governmental regulation.          The aviation industry is highly regulated by the FAA in the United States and equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. Beforewe sell any of our products that are to be installed in an aircraft, such as engines, engine parts and components, and airframe and accessory parts and components, they must meet certain standards ofairworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. We operate repair stations that are licensed by the FAA and the equivalent regulatory agencies in othercountries, and hold certificates to operate aircraft. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although regulatory requirements in other countries are generally satisfied by compliance withFAA requirements. New and more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted in the future that, if enacted, may have an adverse impact on us.         Ifany of the Company's material licenses, certificates, authorizations or approvals were revoked or suspended by the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries, ourresults of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.  Our government contracts may not continue at present sales levels, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.          Our sales to agencies of the U.S. government and their contractors were approximately $607,348 (44.9% of consolidated sales) in fiscalyear 2010 (See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). With our acquisition of AWS, we expect such sales to represent a larger portion of our business in the future. Themajority of our U.S. government contracts are for products and services used for ongoing military performance-based logistics support activities, products which support the U.S. military's deploymentstrategy, and expeditionary airlift services in support of military deployments. Our contracts with the U.S. government, including the Department of Defense and its contractors, are typically firmagreements to provide products and services at a fixed price and have a term of one year or less, frequently subject to extension for one or more additional periods of one year at the option of thegovernment customer. Sales to agencies of the U.S. government and their contractors are subject to a number of factors, including the level of troop deployment worldwide, competitive bidding, U.S.government funding requirements generated by world events, and budgetary constraints. Therefore, such sales may not continue at levels previously experienced. While spending authorizations forintelligence and defense-related programs by the U.S. government have increased in recent years, in particular after the 2001 terrorist attacks and more recently as a result of action in support ofmilitary and civil activity in Afghanistan and Iraq, future levels of expenditure, mission priorities and authorizations for these programs may decrease or shift to programs in areas where we do notcurrently provide services, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  If we fail to comply with complex procurement laws and regulations, we could lose business and be liable for various penalties or sanctions.          We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. Theselaws and regulations include the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the Truth in Negotiations Act, Cost Accounting Standards, and laws, regulations and orders restricting the use and dissemination ofclassified information under U.S. export control laws, and the export of certain products and technical information. In complying with these laws and regulations, we may incur significant costs, andnon-compliance may result in the imposition of fines and penalties, including contractual damages. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or if a government audit, review or 11 Table of Contentsinvestigationuncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions. Our reputation could suffer harm if allegations of impropriety weremade against us, which could adversely affect our operating performance and may result in additional expenses and possible loss of revenue. U.S. government contractors that provide support services intheaters of conflict such as Afghanistan have come under increasing scrutiny by agency inspector generals, government auditors and congressional committees. Investigations pursued by any or all ofthese groups may result in adverse publicity for us and reputational harm, regardless of the underlying merit of the allegations being investigated.  We are exposed to risks associated with operating internationally.          We conduct our business in certain foreign countries, some of which are politically unstable or subject to military or civil conflicts.A significant portion of AWS's revenue is derived from providing expeditionary airlift services in Afghanistan. Consequently, we are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to internationaloperations, including the following: military conflicts, civil strife and political risks;   export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;   compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;   the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws, treaties and technical standards and changes in those regulations;  contract award and funding delays;   potential restrictions on transfers of funds;   import and export duties and value added taxes;   transportation delays and interruptions; and   uncertainties arising from foreign local business practices and cultural considerations.         Whilewe have and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of doing business internationally, we cannot ensure that such measureswill be adequate. There can be no assurances that the regions in which we operate will continue to be stable enough to allow us to operate profitably or at all. In connection with our acquisition ofAWS, we expect to enter into a consent agreement with the U.S. Department of State, Office of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, to resolve certain violations of export control laws by AWSthat occurred prior to our acquisition. Under the proposed consent agreement, we would take certain measures to enhance AWS' export compliance program and appoint an internal special complianceofficial to oversee AWS' continuing assessment, improvement and adoption of enhancements to its compliance program. If during the eighteen-month term of the consent agreement, the governmentdetermines we have failedto comply with the terms of the consent agreement, we or one of our subsidiaries may face sanctions, which could include debarment from participating in contracts with the U.S. government.  We are dependent upon the continued availability of financing to manage our business and to execute our business strategy, and additional financing may not be available onterms acceptable to us.          Our ability to manage our business and to execute our business strategy is dependent, in part, on the continued availability of debtand equity capital. Access to the debt and equity capital markets may be limited by various factors, including the condition of overall credit markets, general economic factors, the state of theaviation industry, our financial performance and credit ratings. Debt and equity capital may not continue to be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Our inability to obtain financing onfavorable terms could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 12 Table of Contents Our existing debt includes restrictive and financial covenants.          Certain of our loan agreements require us to comply with various restrictive covenants and some contain financial covenants thatrequire us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests. Our failure to meet these covenants could result in default under these loan agreements and would result in a cross-default under otherloan agreements. In the event of a default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amounts outstanding under loan agreements could be declared immediately due and payable. Our failureto comply with these covenants could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Our industry is susceptible to product and other liability claims, and claims not adequately covered by insurance may adversely affect our financial condition.          Our business exposes us to possible claims for property damage and personal injury or death which may result if an engine, engine partor component, airframe part or accessory or any other aviation product which we have sold, manufactured or repaired fails, or if an aircraft we operated, serviced or in which our products areinstalled crashes and the cause cannot be determined. We carry substantial liability insurance in amounts that we believe are adequate for our risk exposure and commensurate with industry norms.However, claims may arise in the future, and ourinsurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us in all circumstances. Additionally, we might not be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Any productliability claim not covered by adequate insurance could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We must comply with extensive environmental requirements, and any exposure to environmental liabilities may adversely affect us.          Federal, state and local requirements relating to the discharge of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes,and other activities affecting the environment have had and may continue to have an impact on our operations. Management cannot assess the possible effect of compliance with future environmentalrequirements or of future environmental claims for which we may not have adequate indemnification or insurance coverage. If we were required to pay the expenses related to any future environmentalclaims for which neither indemnification nor insurance coverage were available, these expenses could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.         Futureenvironmental regulatory developments in the United States and abroad concerning issues such as climate change, could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs and,through their impact on our customers, reduce demand. Actions may be taken in the future by the U.S. government, state governments within the United States, foreign governments, the InternationalCivil Aviation Organization, or by signatory countries through a new global climate change treaty to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry. The precise nature of any suchrequirements and their applicability to us and our customers are difficult to predict, but the impact to us and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant, including thepotential for increased fuel costs, carbon taxes or fees, or a requirement to purchase carbon credits. 13 Table of Contents  We may need to make significant capital expenditures to keep pace with technological developments in our industry.          The aviation industry is constantly undergoing development and change, and it is likely that new products, equipment and methods ofrepair and overhaul services will be introduced in the future. We may need to make significant expenditures to purchase new equipment and to train our employees to keep pace with any new technologicaldevelopments. These expenditures could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Our operations would be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled personnel or work stoppages.          Because of the complex nature of many of our products and services, we are dependent on an educated and highly skilled workforce.Furthermore, we have a collective bargaining agreement covering approximately 610 employees. Our ability to operate successfully and meet our customers' demands could be jeopardized if we are unableto attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled personnel, including qualified licensed mechanics, to conduct our business, or if we experience a significant or prolonged work stoppage, and mayadversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 14 Table of Contents"

2,AIR,AAR CORP,2006-07-17,"ITEM 1A.        RISKFACTORSThe following is a description of some of theprincipal risks inherent in our business. The risks and uncertainties describedbelow are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties notpresently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, could negativelyimpact our results of operations or financial condition in the future.5 We may be affected by continuing problems in theaviation industry.As a provider of products and services to the aviationindustry, we are greatly affected by the overall economic condition of thatindustry. The aviation industry is historically cyclical. Early in calendaryear 2001, the commercial aviation industry began to experience the negativeeffects of a worldwide economic downturn. The events of September 11, 2001exacerbated that condition, resulting in a significant decline in air traveland reduced capacity by most of the major U.S.-based airlines. Since September 11,2001, the aviation industry has also been negatively affected by historicallyhigh fuel prices, the war on terrorism and the outbreak of Severe AcuteRespiratory Syndrome, or SARS. As a result of these and other events, certaincustomers filed for bankruptcy protection, including Air Canada, AlohaAirlines, Delta Air Lines, Mesaba Airlines, Northwest Airlines, U.S. Airways,United Airlines and Varig.Our business,financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted by thefollowing:·       continuedhistorically high fuel costs;·       futureterrorist attacks and the ongoing war on terrorism;·       deteriorationin the financial condition of some of our existing and potential customers, aswell as airlines currently in bankruptcy;·       reductionsin the need for, or the deferral of, aircraft maintenance and repair servicesand spare parts support;·       retirementof older generation aircraft, resulting in lower prices for spare parts andservices for those aircraft;·       reductionsin demand for used aircraft and engines; and·       futureoutbreaks of SARS or similar communicable diseases.The economic and otherfactors affecting the aviation industry may have an adverse impact on ourresults of operations and financial condition.Our customers maynot be able to meet their financial obligations to us, which would adverselyaffect our financial condition and results of operations.A number of our existingand prospective worldwide airline customers continue to suffer from theproblems affecting the aviation industry, and some have filed for bankruptcyprotection or are only recently emerging from bankruptcy. As a result, certainof these customers continue to pose credit risks to us. Our inability tocollect receivables from one or more important customers could adversely affectour results of operations and financial condition.The market value for our aviation products fluctuates.We have used a number ofassumptions when determining the recoverability of inventories and aircraft andengines which are on lease or available for lease. These assumptions includehistorical sales trends, current and expected usage trends, replacement values,current and expected lease rates, residual values, future demand, and futurecash flows. Principally as a result of the events of September 11, 2001and its impact on the global airline industrys financial condition, fleet sizeand aircraft utilization, we recorded a significant charge for impairedinventories and engines during the second quarter of fiscal 2002 utilizingthose assumptions. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we recorded anadditional charge as a result of a further decline in market value for certainof these inventories, aircraft and engines. Reductions in demand for ourinventories or declining market values, as well as differences between actualresults and the assumptions utilized by us when determining the recoverabilityof our inventories, aircraft and engines, 6 couldresult in additional impairment charges in future periods. We can give noassurance that future impairment charges for our inventories, aircraft andengines will not occur.Our governmentcontracts may not continue at present sales levels, which may have a materialadverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Our sales to the U.S.Department of Defense and its contractors were approximately $300 million (33.5%of consolidated sales) in fiscal year 2006. The majority of our governmentcontracts are for aviation products and services used for ongoing militarylogistic support activities and for products which support the U.S. Militarysdeployment strategy. Our contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense and itscontractors are typically firm agreements to provide products and services at afixed price and have a term of one year or less, frequently subject toextension for one or more additional periods of one year at the option of theU.S. Department of Defense. Because these sales are subject to competitivebidding, government funding and requirements generated by world events, salesto our government customers may not continue at levels previously experienced,which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financialcondition.We may be unable to re-lease or sell currently leasedaircraft and engines.We purchase and leaseaircraft and engines to our customers on an operating lease basis. Our abilityto re-lease or sell these assets on acceptable terms is subject to a number offactors which drive industry capacity, including new aircraft deliveries,availability of used aircraft and engines in the marketplace, competition,financial condition of our customers, overall health of the airline industryand general economic conditions. Our inability to re-lease or sell aircraft andengines that are currently on lease could adversely affect our results ofoperations and financial condition.Our IndianapolisMaintenance Center (IMC) is still in the start-up phase and may not be ableto capture market share from the competition.In June 2004, weentered into a long-term agreement to occupy a significant portion of an airframemaintenance facility in Indianapolis, Indiana. The IMC is comprised of 12airframe maintenance bays (10 of which are available to us), as well asbackshop, warehouse and office space. Revenues at the IMC will fluctuate basedon the demand for maintenance driven by the number of aircraft operating andpotential outsourcing of maintenance activities by airlines. Furthermore, wemay not be able to capture market share in the highly competitive airframemaintenance market at the IMC, or we may not be able to hire and retain therequired amount of qualified licensed aircraft mechanics. As a result, we maynot be able to execute our operational and financial plan at the IMC, whichcould adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We operate in a highly competitive industry, andcompetitive pressures may adversely affect us.The aviation industry andthe markets for our products and services are highly competitive, and we facecompetition from a number of sources. Our competitors include aircraftmanufacturers, aircraft parts manufacturers, airline and aircraft servicecompanies, other companies providing maintenance, repair and overhaul services,and other aircraft spare parts distributors and redistributors. Some of ourcompetitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than wehave. We can give no assurance that competitive pressures will not adverselyaffect our results of operations and financial condition.7 We are dependentupon continued availability of financing to manage our business and to executeour business strategy, and additional financing may not be available on termsacceptable to us.Our ability to manage ourbusiness and to execute our business strategy is dependent, in part, on thecontinuing availability of debt and equity capital. Access to the debt andequity capital markets may be limited by various factors, including generaleconomic conditions, the state of the aviation industry, our financialperformance and current credit ratings. Debt and equity capital may notcontinue to be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Our inability toobtain financing on favorable terms could adversely affect our results ofoperations and financial condition.Our existing debt includes restrictive and financialcovenants.Certain of our loanagreements require us to comply with various restrictive covenants. Thesecovenants include restrictions that limit our ability to incur additional debt,pay dividends, or redeem or repurchase our capital stock; create liens ornegative pledges with respect to our assets; and to merge, consolidate or sellour assets. In addition, some of our loan agreements contain financialcovenants that require us to comply with specified financial ratios and testsrelating to fixed charge coverage and minimum working capital and tangible networth levels. Total outstanding obligations subject to these covenants was$75,000 at May 31, 2006. Our failure to meet these financial covenantscould result in default under these loan agreements and would result in across-default under other loan agreements. In the event of a default and ourinability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amounts outstanding under loanagreements could be declared immediately due and payable. The effect of thesecovenants, or our failure to comply with them, could adversely affect ourresults of operations and financial condition.We are subject tosignificant government regulation and may need to incur significant expenses tocomply with new or more stringent governmental regulation.The aviation industry ishighly regulated by the FAA in the United States and the equivalent regulatoryagencies in other countries. Before we sell any of our products that are to beinstalled in an aircraft, such as engines, engine parts and components, andairframe and accessory parts and components, they must meet certain standardsof airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agenciesin other countries. We also operate repair stations that are licensed by theFAA and in some cases the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries.Specific regulations vary from country to country, although regulatoryrequirements in other countries are generally satisfied by compliance with FAArequirements. Although we believe we comply with all applicable regulatorystandards, these standards may change in the future, requiring our inventory tobe modified or scrapped. New and more stringent governmental regulations may beadopted in the future that, if enacted, may have an adverse impact on us. Ifmaterial licenses, authorizations or approvals were revoked or suspended by theFAA and in some cases the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries,our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.Acquisitions expose us to risks, including the riskthat we may be unable to effectively integrate acquisitions.We explore and havediscussions with third parties regarding possible acquisitions. Acquisitionsinvolve risks including difficulties in integrating the operations andpersonnel of the acquired business, the potential amortization of acquiredintangible assets, the potential impairment of goodwill and the potential lossof key employees of the acquired business. If we acquire one or more businesses,we may not be able to execute our operational, financial or integration plan ofthe acquired businesses, which could adversely affect our results of operationsand profitability.8 Our industry issusceptible to product liability claims, and claims not adequately covered byinsurance may adversely affect our financial condition.Our business exposes us topossible claims for property damage and personal injury or death which mayresult if an engine, engine part or component, airframe part or accessory orany other aviation product which we have sold, manufactured or repaired failsor if an aircraft in which our products are installed crashes and the causecannot be determined. We carry substantial liability insurance in amounts thatwe believe are adequate for our risk exposure and commensurate with industrynorms. However, claims may arise in the future, and our insurance coverage maynot be adequate to protect us in all circumstances. Additionally, we can giveno assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage inthe future at an acceptable cost. Any product liability claim not covered byadequate insurance could adversely affect our results of operations andfinancial condition.We must comply withextensive environmental requirements, and any exposure to environmentalliabilities may adversely affect us.Federal, state and localrequirements relating to the discharge of substances into the environment, thedisposal of hazardous wastes, and other activities affecting the environmenthave had and may continue to have an impact on our manufacturing operations.Compliance with environmental requirements and resolution of environmentalclaims have, in the past, been accomplished without material effect on ourliquidity and capital resources, competitive position or financial condition.Management believes that our expenditures for environmental capital investmentand any remediation necessary to comply with present regulations governingenvironmental protection, and other expenditures for the resolution ofenvironmental claims, will not have a material adverse effect on our business,financial condition or results of operation. Management cannot assess thepossible effect of compliance with future environmental requirements or of futureenvironmental claims for which we may not have adequate indemnification orinsurance coverage. If we were required to pay the expenses related to anyfuture environmental claims for which neither indemnification nor insurancecoverage were available, these expenses could have an adverse impact on ourresults of operations and financial condition. Additional information onenvironmental matters, including an administrative proceeding against one ofour subsidiaries by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, iscontained under Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for thefiscal year ended May 31, 2006.We may need to makesignificant capital expenditures to keep pace with technological developmentsin our industry.The aviation industry isconstantly undergoing development and change, and it is likely that newproducts, equipment and methods of repair and overhaul services will beintroduced in the future. We may need to make significant capital expendituresto purchase new equipment and to train our employees to keep pace with any newtechnological developments. These capital expenditures could adversely affectour results of operations and financial condition.Our operations would be adversely affected by ashortage of skilled personnel.Because of the complex nature of many of our productsand services, we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilledworkforce. Our ability to operate successfully and meet our customers demandscould be jeopardized if we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient numberof skilled personnel to conduct our business, and may adversely affect ourresults of operations and profitability.9We face risks ofcost overruns and losses on fixed-price contracts.We sell certain of ourproducts and services under firm, fixed-price contracts providing for fixedprices for the products and services, regardless of costs incurred by us. Thecost of producing products or providing services may be adversely affected byincreases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, overhead and other factors,including manufacturing inefficiencies. Increased costs may result in costoverruns and losses on such contracts which could adversely affect our resultsof operations and financial condition"
