Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors
This Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) with respect to the financial condition, results of operations, and business of Avnet. These statements are generally identified by words like “believes,” “plans,” “projects,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “should,” “will,” “may,” “estimates,” or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, and actual results and other outcomes could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which that statement is made. Except as required by law, the Company does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date on which the statement is made.Risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements include the risk factors discussed below as well as risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that management does not currently consider material. Such factors make the Company’s operating results for future periods difficult to predict and, therefore, prior results do not necessarily indicate results in future periods. Some of the risks disclosed below may have already occurred, but not to a degree that management considers material unless otherwise noted. Any of the below factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, may have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, operating results, prospects, and liquidity. Similarly, the price of the Company’s common stock is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions; actual financial results that do not meet the Company’s or the investment community’s expectations; changes in the Company’s or the investment community’s expectations for the Company’s future results, dividends or share repurchases; and other factors, many of which are beyond the Company’s control. Business and Operations RisksChanges in customer needs and consumption modelsChanges in customer product demands and consumption models may cause a decline in the Company’s billings, which would have a negative impact on the Company’s financial results. Changes in technology (such as artificial intelligence) could reduce the types or quantity of services that customers require from the Company. While the Company attempts to identify changes in market conditions as soon as possible, the dynamics of the industries in which 9Table of Contentsit operates make it difficult to predict and timely react to such changes, including those relating to product capacity and lead times. Also, future downturns, inflation, or supply chain challenges, including in the semiconductor and embedded solutions industries, could adversely affect the Company’s relationships with its customers, operating results, and profitability. Specifically, the semiconductor industry experiences periodic fluctuations in product supply and demand (often associated with changes in economic conditions, technology, and manufacturing capacity) and suppliers may not adequately predict or meet customer demand. Geopolitical uncertainty (including from military conflicts; health-related crises; and international trade disputes) have led, and may continue to lead, to shortages, extended lead times, and unpredictability in the supply of certain semiconductors and other electronic components. In reaction, customers may over order to ensure sufficient inventory, which, when the shortage lessens, may result in order cancellations and decreases. In cases where customers have entered into non-cancellable/ non-returnable orders, customers may not be able or willing to carry out the terms of the orders. The Company’s prices to customers depend on many factors, including product availability, supplier costs, and competitive pressures. In fiscal 2022 and 2023, pricing to customers increased due to higher costs from suppliers, as well as higher freight and other costs. However, the Company may not be able to maintain higher prices to customers in the future. As product becomes more available, customer and competitive pressures may lower prices to customers, which could reduce the Company’s margins. In addition, the Company may be unable to increase prices to customers to offset higher internal costs, which could also reduce margins. During fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, sales of semiconductors represented approximately 81%, 76%, and 75% of the Company’s consolidated sales, respectively, and the Company’s sales closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor industry. These conditions make it more difficult to manage the Company’s business and predict future performance.Disruptions to key supplier and customer relationshipsOne of the Company’s competitive strengths is the breadth and quality of the suppliers whose products the Company distributes. For fiscal 2023, there was one of the Company’s suppliers that accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s consolidated billings. The Company’s contracts with its suppliers vary in duration and are generally terminable by either party at will upon notice. The Company’s suppliers may terminate or significantly reduce their volume of business with the Company because of a product shortage, an unwillingness to do business with the Company, changes in strategy, or otherwise. Shortages of products or loss of a supplier may negatively affect the Company’s business and relationships with its customers, as customers depend on the Company’s timely delivery of technology hardware and software from the industry’s leading suppliers. In addition, shifts in suppliers’ strategies, or performance and delivery issues, may negatively affect the Company’s financial results. These conditions make it more difficult to manage the Company’s business and predict future performance. The competitive landscape has also experienced a consolidation among suppliers and capacity constraints, which could negatively impact the Company’s profitability and customer base.Further, if key suppliers modify the terms of their contracts (including, without limitation, terms regarding price protection, rights of return, order cancellation rights, delivery commitments, rebates, or other terms that protect or enhance the Company’s gross margins), it could negatively affect the Company’s results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. Due to recent global shortages of semiconductors, some suppliers have increased the amount of non-cancellable/ non-returnable orders, which limited the Company’s ability to adjust down its inventory levels. The Company may attempt to limit associated risks by passing such terms on to its customers, but this may not be possible.10Table of ContentsRisks related to international operationsDuring fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 approximately 76%, 77% and 78%, respectively, of the Company’s sales came from its operations outside the United States. The Company’s operations are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including, but not limited to, the following:●potential restrictions on the Company’s ability to repatriate funds from its foreign subsidiaries;●foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations;●non-compliance with foreign and domestic data privacy regulations, business licensing requirements, environmental regulations, and anti-corruption laws, the failure of which could result in severe penalties including monetary fines and criminal proceedings;●non-compliance with foreign and domestic import and export regulations and adoption or expansion of trade restrictions, including technology transfer restrictions, additional license, permit or authorization requirements for shipments, specific company sanctions, new and higher duties, tariffs or surcharges, or other import/export controls;●complex and changing tax laws and regulations; ●regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ between jurisdictions; ●economic and political instability, terrorism, military conflicts (including the Russia-Ukraine conflict), or civilian unrest;●fluctuations in freight costs (both inbound and outbound), limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure;●natural disasters (including as a result of climate change), pandemics, and other public health crises; ●differing employment practices and labor issues; and●non-compliance with local laws.In addition to the cost of compliance, the potential criminal penalties for violations of import or export regulations and anti-corruption laws, by the Company or its third-party agents, create heightened risks for the Company’s international operations. If a regulatory body determines that the Company has violated such laws, the Company could be fined significant sums, incur sizable legal defense costs, have its import or export capabilities restricted or denied, or have its inventories seized, which could have a material and adverse effect on the Company’s business. Additionally, allegations that the Company has violated any such regulations may negatively impact the Company’s reputation, which may result in customers or suppliers being unwilling to do business with the Company. While the Company has adopted measures and controls designed to ensure compliance with these laws, these measures may not be adequate, and the Company may be materially and adversely impacted in the event of an actual or alleged violation.Tariffs, trade restrictions, and sanctions resulting from international trade disputes, changes in trade policies, or military conflicts may adversely affect the Company’s sales and profitability. For example, the U.S. government imposed several trade policies, rules, and restrictions applicable to China and Hong Kong. In addition, in response to the Russian-Ukraine conflict, the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and numerous other countries initiated a variety of sanctions, export restrictions, currency controls and other restrictions against Russia. The Chinese and Russian governments have responded in kind with restrictions, sanctions, and other measures. These actions have resulted in losses; increased costs, including increased costs of procuring certain products the Company purchases from its suppliers; shortages of materials and electronic components; increased expenses such as energy, fuel, and freight costs, which may not 11Table of Contentsbe possible to pass on to customers; increased cyber security attacks; credit market disruptions; and inflation, which may impact the Company’s sales, customer demand for certain products, access to certain markets, and profits. In addition, increased operational expenses incurred in minimizing the number of products subject to the tariffs could adversely affect the Company’s operating profits. Neither U.S. tariffs nor any retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods have yet had a material impact, but any future actions or escalations that affect trade relations could materially affect the Company’s sales and results of operations. The Company transacts sales, pays expenses, owns assets, and incurs liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Because the Company’s consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars, the Company must translate such activities and amounts into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect during each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and other currencies affect the Company’s reported amounts of sales, operating income, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, unexpected and dramatic changes in foreign currency exchange rates may negatively affect the Company’s earnings from those markets. While the Company may use derivative financial instruments to reduce its net exposure, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may materially affect the Company’s financial results. Further, foreign currency instability and disruptions in the credit and capital markets may increase credit risks for some of the Company’s customers and may impair its customers’ ability to repay existing obligations.Internal information systems failuresThe Company depends on its information systems to facilitate its day-to-day operations and to produce timely, accurate, and reliable information on financial and operational results. Currently, the Company’s global operations are tracked with multiple information systems, including systems from acquired businesses, some of which are subject to ongoing IT projects designed to streamline or optimize the Company’s systems. These IT projects are extremely complex, in part because of wide ranging processes, use of on-premise and cloud environments, the Company’s business operations, and changes in information technology (including artificial intelligence). The Company may not always succeed at these efforts. Implementation or integration difficulties may adversely affect the Company’s ability to complete business transactions and ensure accurate recording and reporting of financial data. In addition, IT projects may not achieve the expected efficiencies and cost savings, which could negatively impact the Company’s financial results. A failure of any of these information systems (including due to power losses, computer and telecommunications failures, cyber security incidents, or manmade or natural disasters), or material difficulties in upgrading these information systems, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, internal controls, and reporting obligations under federal securities laws.Due to the Company’s increased online sales, system interruptions and delays that make its websites and services unavailable or slow to respond may reduce the attractiveness of its products and services to its customers. If the Company is unable to continually improve the efficiency of its systems, it could cause systems interruptions or delays and adversely affect the Company’s operating results.Logistics disruptionsThe Company’s global logistics services are operated through specialized and centralized distribution centers around the globe, some of which are outsourced. The Company also depends almost entirely on third-party transportation service providers to deliver products to its customers. A major interruption or disruption in service at one or more of its distribution centers for any reason or significant disruptions of services from the Company’s third-party transportation providers could cause a delay in expected cost savings or an increase in expenses, which may not be possible to pass on to customers. Such disruptions could result from risks related to information technology, data security, or any of the General Risk Factors
, as discussed herein. In addition, as the Company continues to increase capacity at various distribution centers, it may experience operational challenges, increased costs, decreased efficiency, 12Table of Contentsand customer delivery delays and failures. Such operational challenges could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business partners, and on the Company’s business, operations, financial performance, and reputation.Data security and privacy threatsThreats to the Company’s data and information technology systems (including cyber security attacks such as phishing and ransomware) are becoming more frequent and sophisticated. Threat actors have successfully breached the Company’s systems and processes in various ways, and such cyber security breaches expose the Company to significant potential liability and reputational harm. Cyber security attacks have not yet materially impacted the Company’s data (including data about customers, suppliers, and employees) or the Company’s operations, financial condition, or data security, but future attacks could have a material impact. Threat actors seek unauthorized access to intellectual property, or confidential or proprietary information regarding the Company, its customers, its business partners, or its employees. They deploy malicious software programs that exploit security vulnerabilities, including ransomware designed to encrypt the Company’s files so an attacker may demand a ransom for restored access. They also seek to misdirect money, sabotage data and systems, takeover internal processes, and induce employees or other system users to disclose sensitive information, including login credentials. In addition, some Company employees continue to work from home on a full-time or hybrid basis, which increases the Company’s vulnerability to cyber and other information technology risks. Further, the Company’s business partners and service providers, such as suppliers, customers, and hosted solution providers, pose a security risk because their own security systems or infrastructure may become compromised. The Company seeks to protect and secure its systems and information, prevent and detect evolving threats, and respond to threats as they occur. Measures taken include implementing and enhancing information security controls such as enterprise-wide firewalls, intrusion detection, endpoint protection, email security, disaster recovery, vulnerability management, and cyber security training for employees to enhance awareness of general security best practices, financial fraud, and phishing. Despite these efforts, the Company may not always be successful. Threat actors frequently change their techniques and, consequently, the Company may not always promptly detect the existence or scope of a security breach. As these types of threats grow and evolve, the Company may make further investments to protect its data and information technology infrastructure, which may impact the Company’s profitability. The Company’s insurance coverage for protecting against cyber-attacks may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims, and the Company may suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on its business. As a global enterprise, the Company may be negatively impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices, related to cybersecurity, data privacy, data localization, and data protection. Failure to comply with such requirements could have an adverse effect on the Company’s reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations, as well as subject the Company to significant fines, litigation losses, third-party damages, and other liabilities.Financial RisksInventory value declineThe electronic components and integrated products industries are subject to technological change, new and enhanced products, changes in customer needs, and changes in industry standards and regulatory requirements, which can cause the Company’s inventory to decline in value or become obsolete. Regardless of the general economic environment, prices may decline due to a decrease in demand or an oversupply of products, which may increase the risk of declines in inventory value. Many of the Company’s suppliers offer certain protections from the loss in value of inventory (such as price protection and limited rights of return), but such policies may not fully compensate for the loss. Also, suppliers may not honor such agreements, some of which are subject to the supplier discretion. In addition, most Company sales are made pursuant to individual purchase orders, rather than through long-term sales contracts. Where there are contracts, such contracts are generally terminable at will upon notice. Unforeseen product developments, 13Table of Contentsinventory value declines, or customer cancellations may adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.Accounts receivable defaultsAccounts receivable are a significant portion of the Company’s working capital. If entities responsible for a significant amount of accounts receivable cease doing business, direct their business elsewhere, fail to pay, or delay payment, the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity could be adversely affected. An economic or industry downturn could adversely affect the Company’s ability to collect receivables, which could result in longer payment cycles, increased collection costs, and defaults exceeding management’s expectations. A significant deterioration in the Company’s ability to collect accounts receivable in the United States could impact the cost or availability of financing under its accounts receivable securitization program. Liquidity and capital resources constraintsThe Company’s ability to satisfy its cash needs and implement its capital allocation strategy depends on its ability to generate cash from operations and to access the financial markets, both of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond the Company’s control. In addition to cash on hand, the Company relies on external financing to help satisfy its cash needs. However, various factors affect external financing, including general market conditions, interest rate fluctuations, and the Company’s debt ratings and operating results. Consequently, external financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. An increase in the Company’s debt or deterioration of its operating results may cause a reduction in its debt ratings. Any such reduction could negatively impact the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing or renew existing financing, and could result in reduced credit limits, increased financing expenses, and additional restrictions and covenants. A reduction in its current debt rating may also negatively impact the Company’s working capital and impair its relationship with its customers and suppliers.As of July 1, 2023, the Company had debt outstanding with financial institutions under various notes, secured borrowings, and committed and uncommitted lines of credit. The Company needs cash to pay debt principal and interest, and for general corporate purposes, such as funding its ongoing working capital and capital expenditure needs. Under certain of its credit facilities, the applicable interest rate and costs are based in part on the Company’s current debt rating. If its debt rating is reduced, higher interest rates and increased costs would result. Any material increase in the Company’s financing costs or loss of access to cost-effective financing could have an adverse effect on its profitability, results of operations, and cash flows. Under some of its credit facilities, the Company is required to maintain a maximum leverage ratio and pass certain financial tests. If the Company increases its level of debt or its operating results deteriorate, it may fail to meet this financial ratio or pass these tests, which may result in an event of default. In such an event, lenders may accelerate payment and the Company may be unable to continue to utilize these facilities. If the Company is unable to utilize these facilities or is required to repay debt earlier than management expected, it may not have sufficient cash available to make interest payments, to repay indebtedness, or for general corporate needs. General economic or business conditions, both domestic and foreign, may be less favorable than management expects and could adversely impact the Company’s sales or its ability to collect receivables from its customers, which may impact access to the Company’s accounts receivable securitization program.Financing covenants and restrictions may limit management discretionThe agreements governing the Company’s financing, including its credit facility, accounts receivable securitization program, and the indentures governing the Company’s outstanding notes, contain various covenants and restrictions that, 14Table of Contentsin certain circumstances, limit the Company’s ability, and the ability of certain subsidiaries, to:●grant liens on assets;●make restricted payments (including, under certain circumstances, paying dividends on, redeeming or repurchasing common stock);●make certain investments;●merge, consolidate, or transfer all, or substantially all, of the Company’s assets;●incur additional debt; or●engage in certain transactions with affiliates.As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the Company may be limited in the future in how it conducts its business and may be unable to raise additional debt, repurchase common stock, pay a dividend, compete effectively, or make further investments.Tax law changes and complianceAs a multinational corporation, the Company is subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States and many foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, governments enact or revise tax laws and regulations, which are further subject to interpretations, guidance, amendments, and technical corrections from international, federal, and state tax authorities. Such changes to tax law may adversely affect the Company’s cash flow, costs of share buybacks, and effective tax rate, including through decreases in allowable deductions and higher tax rates. Many countries are adopting provisions to align their international tax rules with the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, led by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and supported by the United States. The project aims to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, including tax rate increases and a global minimum tax. In October 2021, a substantial majority of the OECD’s participating countries and jurisdictions agreed to introduce a 15% global minimum corporate tax rate that would apply to companies with revenue over a set threshold. Furthermore, many countries are independently evaluating their corporate tax policy, which could result in tax legislation and enforcement that adversely impacts the Company’s tax provision and value of deferred assets and liabilities. These provisions, if enacted, individually or as a whole, may negatively impact taxation of international business.The tax laws and regulations of the various countries where the Company has operations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. The Company believes that its historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable law, and that it has adequately reserved for income taxes. However, taxing authorities may challenge such positions and the Company may not be successful in defending against any such challenges. The Company’s future income tax expense could be favorably or adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets, and liabilities and changes to its operating structure.Constraints on internal controlsEffective internal controls are necessary for the Company to provide reliable financial reports, safeguard its assets, and prevent and detect fraud. If the Company cannot do so, its brand and operating results could be harmed. Internal controls over financial reporting are intended to prevent and detect material misstatements in its financial reporting and material fraudulent activity, but are limited by human error, circumventing or overriding controls, and fraud. As a result, the Company may not identify all material activity or all immaterial activity that could aggregate into a material 15Table of Contentsmisstatement. Therefore, even effective internal controls cannot guarantee that financial statements are wholly accurate or prevent all fraud and loss of assets. Management continually evaluates the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s internal controls. However, if the Company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved internal controls, or if the Company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the Company’s business and operating results could be harmed. Additionally, the Company may be subject to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities, or the Company could fail to meet its reporting obligations, all of which could have an adverse effect on its business or the market price of the Company’s securities.Acquisition expected benefits shortfallThe Company has made, and expects to make, strategic acquisitions or investments globally to further its strategic objectives and support key business initiatives. Acquisitions and investments involve risks and uncertainties, some of which may differ from those associated with the Company’s historical operations. Such risks include, but are not limited to, risks relating to expanding into emerging markets and business areas, adding additional product lines and services, impacting existing customer and supplier relationships, incurring costs or liabilities associated with the companies acquired, incurring potential impairment charges on acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, and diverting management’s attention from existing operations and initiatives. As a result, the Company’s profitability may be negatively impacted. In addition, the Company may not successfully integrate the acquired businesses, or the integration may be more difficult, costly, or time-consuming than anticipated. Further, any litigation involving the potential acquisition or acquired entity will increase expenses associated with the acquisition, cause a delay in completing the acquisition, impact the ability to integrate the acquired entity, which may impact the Company’s profitability. The Company may experience disruptions that could, depending on the size of the acquisition, have an adverse effect on its business, especially where an acquisition target may have pre-existing regulatory issues or deficiencies, or material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting. Furthermore, the Company may not realize all benefits anticipated from its acquisitions, which could adversely affect the Company’s financial performance.Legal and Regulatory RisksLegal proceedings costs and damagesFrom time to time, the Company may become involved in legal proceedings, including government investigations, that arise out of the ordinary conduct of the Company’s business, including matters involving intellectual property rights, commercial matters, merger-related matters, product liability, and other actions. Legal proceedings could result in substantial costs and diversion of management’s efforts and other resources, and could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations and business reputation. The Company may be obligated to indemnify and defend its customers if the products or services that the Company sells are alleged to infringe any third party’s intellectual property rights. The Company may not be able to obtain supplier indemnification for itself and its customers against such claims, or such indemnification may not fully protect the Company and its customers against such claims. Also, the Company is exposed to potential liability for technology and products that it develops for which it has no indemnification protections. If an infringement claim against the Company is successful, the Company may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. The Company may have to stop selling certain products or services, which could affect its ability to compete effectively. In addition, the Company’s expanding business activities may include the assembly or manufacture of electronic component products and systems. Product defects, whether caused by a design, assembly, manufacture or component failure or error, or manufacturing processes not in compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, may result in product liability claims, product recalls, fines, and penalties. Product liability risks could be particularly significant with respect to aerospace, 16Table of Contentsautomotive, and medical applications because of the risk of serious harm to users of such products. Environmental regulations non-complianceThe Company is subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations addressing environmental and other impacts from industrial processes, waste disposal, carbon emissions, use of hazardous materials in products and operations, recycling products, and other related matters. While the Company strives to fully comply with all applicable regulations, certain of these regulations impose liability without fault. Additionally, the Company may be held responsible for the prior activities of an entity it acquired.Failure to comply with these regulations could result in substantial costs, fines, and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury. Future environmental laws and regulations, including disclosure requirements, may become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs, and increasing risks, penalties and reputational harm associated with violations.Customers, suppliers, investors, and regulatory agencies in various jurisdictions globally are increasingly requesting or requiring disclosure and action regarding the Company’s supply chain due-diligence and environmental, social, and governance practices. Such increased expectations and regulations may increase compliance costs and result in reputational damage and loss of business if the Company is perceived to have not met such expectations.General Risk Factors
Negative impacts of economic or geopolitical uncertainty, or a health crisis, on operations and financial resultsEconomic weakness and geopolitical uncertainty (including from military conflicts and international trade disputes), as well as health-related crises (including pandemics and epidemics), have resulted, and may result in the future, in a variety of adverse impacts on the Company and its customers and suppliers. Such adverse impacts include decreased sales, margins, and earnings; increased logistics costs; demand uncertainty; constrained workforce participation; global supply chain disruptions; and logistics and distribution system disruptions. Such crises and uncertainties could also result in, or heighten the risks of, customer bankruptcies, customer delayed or defaulted payments, delays in product deliveries, financial market disruption and volatility, and other risk factors described in the Company’s Annual Report. As a result, the Company may need to impair assets (including goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets), implement restructuring actions, and reduce expenses in response to decreased sales or margins.The Company may not be able to adequately adjust its cost structure in a timely fashion, which may adversely impact its profitability. Uncertainty about economic conditions may increase foreign currency volatility, which may negatively impact the Company’s results. Economic weakness and geopolitical uncertainty also make it more difficult for the Company to manage inventory levels (including when customers decrease orders, cancel existing orders, or are unable to fulfill their obligations under non-cancelable/ non-return orders) and collect customer receivables, which may result in provisions to create reserves, write-offs, reduced access to liquidity, higher financing costs, and increased pressure on cash flows.An increase in or prolonged period of inflation could affect the Company’s profitability and cash flows, due to higher wages, higher operating expenses, higher financing costs, and higher supplier prices. Inflation may also adversely affect foreign exchange rates. The Company may be unable to pass along such higher costs to its customers, which may result in lower gross profit margins. In addition, inflation may adversely affect customers’ financing costs, cash flows, and profitability, which could adversely impact their operations and the Company’s ability to offer credit and collect receivables.17Table of ContentsCompetitionThe market for the Company’s products and services is very competitive and subject to technological advances (including artificial intelligence), new competitors, non-traditional competitors, and changes in industry standards. The Company competes with other global and regional distributors, as well as some of the Company’s own suppliers that maintain direct sales efforts. In addition, as the Company expands its offerings and geographies, the Company may encounter increased competition from current or new competitors. The Company’s failure to maintain and enhance its competitive position could adversely affect its business and prospects. Furthermore, the Company’s efforts to compete in the marketplace could cause deterioration of gross profit margins and, thus, overall profitability.The size of the Company’s competitors varies across market sectors, as do the resources the Company has allocated to the sectors and geographic areas in which it does business. Therefore, some competitors may have greater resources or a more extensive customer or supplier base in some market sectors and geographic areas. As a result, the Company may not be able to effectively compete in certain markets, which could impact the Company’s profitability and prospects.Employee retention and hiring constraintsIdentifying, hiring, training, developing, and retaining qualified and engaged employees is critical to the Company’s success, and competition for experienced employees in the Company’s industry can be intense. Restrictions on immigration or changes in immigration laws, including visa restrictions, may limit the Company’s acquisition of key talent, including talent with diverse experience, background, ability, and perspectives. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers leave the Company. In addition, as global opportunities and industry demands shift, and as the Company expands its offerings, the Company may encounter challenges in realigning, training, and hiring skilled personnel. Through organizational design activities, the Company periodically eliminates positions due to restructurings or other reasons, which may risk the Company’s brand reputation as an employer of choice and negatively impact the Company’s ability to hire and retain qualified personnel. Also, position eliminations may negatively impact the morale of employees who are not terminated, which could result in work stoppages or slowdowns, particularly where employees are represented by unions or works councils. If these circumstances occur, the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations could be seriously harmed.​"

Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors
This Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) with respect to the financial condition, results of operations, and business of Avnet. These statements are generally identified by words like “believes,” “plans,” “projects,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “should,” “will,” “may,” “estimates,” or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, and actual results and other outcomes could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which that statement is made. Except as required by law, the Company does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date on which the statement is made.Risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements include the risk factors discussed below, but may also include risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that management does not currently consider material. Such factors make the Company’s operating results for future periods difficult to predict and, therefore, prior results do not necessarily indicate results in future periods except as disclosed. Some of the risks disclosed below may have already occurred, but not to a degree that management considers material unless otherwise noted. Any of the below factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, may have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, operating results, prospects, and liquidity. Similarly, the price of the Company’s common stock is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions; actual financial results that do not meet the Company’s or the investment community’s expectations; changes in the Company’s or the investment community’s expectations for the Company’s future results, dividends or share repurchases; and other factors, many of which are beyond the Company’s control. Business and Operations RisksChanges in customer needs and consumption modelsChanges in customer product demands and consumption models may cause a decline in the Company’s billings, which would have a negative impact on the Company’s financial results. While the Company attempts to identify changes in market conditions as soon as possible, the dynamics of the industries in which it operates make it difficult to predict and timely react to such changes, including those relating to product capacity and lead times. Also, future 10Table of Contentsdownturns or supply chain challenges, including in the semiconductor and embedded solutions industries, could adversely affect the Company’s relationships with its customers, operating results, and profitability. Specifically, the semiconductor industry experiences periodic fluctuations in product supply and demand (often associated with changes in economic conditions, technology, and manufacturing capacity) and suppliers may not adequately predict or meet customer demand. The Russia-Ukraine conflict and the COVID-19 pandemic have led, and may continue to lead, to shortages, extended lead times, and unpredictability in the supply of certain semiconductors and other electronic components. In reaction, customers may over order to ensure sufficient inventory, which, when the shortage lessens, may result in order cancellations and decreases. In cases where customers have entered into non-cancellable/ non-returnable orders, customers may not be able or willing to carry out the terms of the orders. The Company’s prices to customers depend on many factors, including product availability, supplier costs, and competitive pressures. In fiscal 2022, pricing to customers increased due to higher costs from suppliers, as well as higher freight and other costs. However, the Company may not be able to maintain higher prices to customers in the future. As product becomes more available, customer and competitive pressures may lower prices to customers, which could reduce the Company’s margins. In addition, the Company may be unable to increase prices to customers to offset higher internal costs, which could also reduce margins. During fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, sales of semiconductors represented approximately 76%, 75%, and 76% of the Company’s consolidated sales, respectively, and the Company’s sales closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor industry. These conditions make it more difficult to manage the Company’s business and predict future performance.Due to the Company’s increased online sales, system interruptions and delays that make its websites and services unavailable or slow to respond may reduce the attractiveness of its products and services to its customers. If the Company is unable to continually improve the efficiency of its systems, it could cause systems interruptions or delays and adversely affect the Company’s operating results.Disruptions to key supplier and customer relationshipsOne of the Company’s competitive strengths is the breadth and quality of the suppliers whose products the Company distributes. For fiscal 2022, there were no Company suppliers that accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s consolidated billings. The Company’s contracts with its suppliers vary in duration and are generally terminable by either party at will upon notice. The Company’s suppliers may terminate or significantly reduce their volume of business with the Company because of a product shortage, an unwillingness to do business with the Company, changes in strategy, or otherwise. Shortages of products or loss of a supplier may negatively affect the Company’s business and relationships with its customers, as customers depend on the Company’s timely delivery of technology hardware and software from the industry’s leading suppliers. In addition, shifts in suppliers’ strategies, or performance and delivery issues, may negatively affect the Company’s financial results. These conditions make it more difficult to manage the Company’s business and predict future performance. The competitive landscape has also experienced a consolidation among suppliers and capacity constraints, which could negatively impact the Company’s profitability and customer base.Further, if key suppliers modify the terms of their contracts (including, without limitation, terms regarding price protection, rights of return, order cancellation rights, delivery commitments, rebates, or other terms that protect or enhance the Company’s gross margins), it could negatively affect the Company’s results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. Due to recent global shortages of semiconductors, some suppliers have increased the amount of non-cancellable/ non-returnable orders, which may limit the Company’s ability to adjust down its inventory levels in the event of market downturns. The Company may attempt to limit associated risks by passing such terms on to its customers, but this may not be possible.11Risks related to international operationsDuring fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 approximately 77%, 78% and 75%, respectively, of the Company’s sales came from its operations outside the United States. The Company’s operations are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including, but not limited to, the following:●potential restrictions on the Company’s ability to repatriate funds from its foreign subsidiaries;●foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations;●non-compliance with foreign and domestic data privacy regulations, business licensing requirements, environmental regulations, and anti-corruption laws, the failure of which could result in severe penalties including monetary fines and criminal proceedings;●non-compliance with foreign and domestic import and export regulations and adoption or expansion of trade restrictions, including technology transfer restrictions, additional license, permit or authorization requirements for shipments, specific company sanctions, new and higher duties, tariffs or surcharges, or other import/export controls;●complex and changing tax laws and regulations; ●regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ between jurisdictions; ●economic and political instability, terrorism, military conflicts (including the Russia-Ukraine conflict), or civilian unrest;●fluctuations in freight costs (both inbound and outbound), limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure;●natural disasters (including as a result of climate change), pandemics, and other public health crises; ●differing employment practices and labor issues; and●non-compliance with local laws.In addition to the cost of compliance, the potential criminal penalties for violations of import or export regulations and anti-corruption laws, by the Company or its third-party agents, create heightened risks for the Company’s international operations. If a regulatory body determines that the Company has violated such laws, the Company could be fined significant sums, incur sizable legal defense costs, have its import or export capabilities restricted or denied, or have its inventories seized, which could have a material and adverse effect on the Company’s business. Additionally, allegations that the Company has violated any such regulations may negatively impact the Company’s reputation, which may result in customers or suppliers being unwilling to do business with the Company. While the Company has adopted measures and controls designed to ensure compliance with these laws, the Company cannot be assured that such measures will be adequate or that its business will not be materially and adversely impacted in the event of an alleged violation.Tariffs, trade restrictions, and sanctions resulting from international trade disputes, changes in trade policies, or military conflicts may adversely affect the Company’s sales and profitability. For example, the U.S. government imposed several trade policies, rules, and restrictions applicable to China and Hong Kong. In addition, in response to the Russian-Ukraine conflict, the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and numerous other countries initiated a variety of sanctions, export restrictions, currency controls and other restrictions against Russia. The Chinese and Russian governments have responded in kind with restrictions, sanctions, and other measures. These actions have resulted in losses; increased costs, including increased costs of procuring certain products the Company purchases from its suppliers; shortages of materials and electronic components; increased expenses such as energy, fuel, and freight costs, which may not 12Table of Contentsbe possible to pass on to customers; increased cyber security attacks; credit market disruptions; and inflation, which may impact the Company’s sales, customer demand for certain products, access to certain markets, and profits. In addition, increased operational expenses incurred in minimizing the number of products subject to the tariffs could adversely affect the Company’s operating profits. Neither U.S. tariffs nor any retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods have yet had a material impact, but any future actions or escalations that affect trade relations could materially affect the Company’s sales and results of operations. The Company transacts sales, pays expenses, owns assets, and incurs liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Because the Company’s consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars, the Company must translate such activities and amounts into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect during each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and other currencies affect the Company’s reported amounts of sales, operating income, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, unexpected and dramatic changes in foreign currency exchange rates may negatively affect the Company’s earnings from those markets. While the Company may use derivative financial instruments to reduce its net exposure, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may materially affect the Company’s financial results. Further, foreign currency instability and disruptions in the credit and capital markets may increase credit risks for some of the Company’s customers and may impair its customers’ ability to repay existing obligations.Internal information systems failuresThe Company depends on its information systems to facilitate its day-to-day operations and to produce timely, accurate, and reliable information on financial and operational results. Currently, the Company’s global operations are tracked with multiple information systems, including systems from acquired businesses, some of which are subject to ongoing IT projects designed to streamline or optimize the Company’s systems. These IT projects are extremely complex, in part because of wide ranging processes, use of on-premise and cloud environments, and the Company’s business operations. The Company may not always succeed at these efforts. Implementation or integration difficulties may adversely affect the Company’s ability to complete business transactions and ensure accurate recording and reporting of financial data. In addition, IT projects may not achieve the expected efficiencies and cost savings, which could negatively impact the Company’s financial results. A failure of any of these information systems (including due to power losses, computer and telecommunications failures, cyber security incidents, or manmade or natural disasters), or material difficulties in upgrading these information systems, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, internal controls, and reporting obligations under federal securities laws.Logistics disruptionsThe Company’s global logistics services are operated through specialized and centralized distribution centers around the globe, some of which are outsourced. The Company also depends almost entirely on third-party transportation service providers to deliver products to its customers. A major interruption or disruption in service at one or more of its distribution centers for any reason (such as information technology upgrades and operating issues, warehouse modernization and relocation efforts, natural disasters, pandemics and other public health crises, geopolitical instability, military conflicts or terrorist attacks) or significant disruptions of services from the Company’s third-party transportation providers (such as transportation constraints due to labor shortages, disruptions to ports and other shipping infrastructures, border closures, other travel or health-related restrictions, and increased transportation costs related to gas price increases and shortages) could cause a delay in expected cost savings or an increase in expenses, which may not be possible to pass on to customers. In addition, as the Company continues to increase capacity at various distribution centers, it may experience operational challenges, increased costs, decreased efficiency, and customer delivery delays and failures. Such operational challenges could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business partners, and on the Company’s business, operations, financial performance, and reputation.13Data security and privacy threatsThreats to the Company’s data and information technology systems (including cyber security attacks such as phishing and ransomware) are becoming more frequent and sophisticated. Threat actors have successfully breached the Company’s systems and processes in various ways, and such cyber security breaches expose the Company to significant potential liability and reputational harm. Cyber security attacks have not yet materially impacted the Company’s data (including data about customers, suppliers, and employees) or the Company’s operations, financial condition, or data security, but future attacks could have a material impact. Threat actors seek unauthorized access to intellectual property, or confidential or proprietary information regarding the Company, its customers, its business partners, or its employees. They deploy malicious software programs that exploit security vulnerabilities, including ransomware designed to encrypt the Company’s files so an attacker may demand a ransom for restored access. They also seek to misdirect money, sabotage data and systems, takeover internal processes, and induce employees or other system users to disclose sensitive information, including login credentials. In addition, some Company employees continue to work from home on a full-time or hybrid basis, which increases the Company’s vulnerability to cyber and other information technology risks. Further, the Company’s business partners and service providers, such as suppliers, customers, and hosted solution providers, pose a security risk because their own security systems or infrastructure may become compromised. The Company seeks to protect and secure its systems and information, prevent and detect evolving threats, and respond to threats as they occur. Measures taken include implementing and enhancing information security controls such as enterprise-wide firewalls, intrusion detection, endpoint protection, email security, disaster recovery, vulnerability management, and cyber security training for employees to enhance awareness of general security best practices, financial fraud, and phishing. Despite these efforts, the Company  may not always be successful. Threat actors frequently change their techniques and, consequently, the Company may not always promptly detect the existence or scope of a security breach. As these types of threats grow and evolve, the Company may make further investments to protect its data and information technology infrastructure, which may impact the Company’s profitability. The Company’s insurance coverage for protecting against cyber-attacks may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims, and the Company may suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on its business. As a global enterprise, the Company may be negatively impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices, related to cybersecurity, data privacy, data localization, and data protection. Failure to comply with such requirements could have an adverse effect on the Company’s reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations, as well as subject the Company to significant fines, litigation losses, third-party damages, and other liabilities.Financial RisksInventory value declineThe electronic components and integrated products industries are subject to rapid technological change, new and enhanced products, changes in customer needs, and changes in industry standards and regulatory requirements, which can cause the Company’s inventory to decline in value or become obsolete. Regardless of the general economic environment, prices may decline due to a decrease in demand or an oversupply of products, which may increase the risk of declines in inventory value. Many of the Company’s suppliers offer certain protections from the loss in value of inventory (such as price protection and limited rights of return), but such policies may not fully compensate for the loss. Also, suppliers may not honor such agreements, some of which are subject to the supplier discretion. In addition, most Company sales are made pursuant to individual purchase orders, rather than through long-term sales contracts. Where there are contracts, such contracts are generally terminable at will upon notice. Unforeseen product developments, inventory value declines, or customer cancellations may adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.14Table of ContentsAccounts receivable defaultsAccounts receivable are a significant portion of the Company’s working capital. If entities responsible for a significant amount of accounts receivable cease doing business, direct their business elsewhere, fail to pay, or delay payment, the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity could be adversely affected. An economic or industry downturn could adversely affect the Company’s ability to collect receivables, which could result in longer payment cycles, increased collection costs, and defaults exceeding management’s expectations. A significant deterioration in the Company’s ability to collect accounts receivable in the United States could impact the cost or availability of financing under its accounts receivable securitization program. Liquidity and capital resources constraintsThe Company’s ability to satisfy its cash needs and implement its capital allocation strategy depends on its ability to generate cash from operations and to access the financial markets, both of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond the Company’s control. The Company may need to satisfy its cash needs through external financing. However, various factors affect external financing, including general market conditions and the Company’s debt ratings and operating results, and may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. An increase in the Company’s debt or deterioration of its operating results may cause a reduction in its debt ratings. Any such reduction could negatively impact the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing or renew existing financing, and could result in reduced credit limits, increased financing expenses, and additional restrictions and covenants. A reduction in its current debt rating may also negatively impact the Company’s working capital and impair its relationship with its customers and suppliers.As of July 2, 2022, the Company had debt outstanding with financial institutions under various notes, secured borrowings, and committed and uncommitted lines of credit. The Company needs cash to pay debt principal and interest, and for general corporate purposes, such as funding its ongoing working capital and capital expenditure needs. Under certain of its credit facilities, the applicable interest rate and costs are based in part on the Company’s current debt rating. If its debt rating is reduced, higher interest rates and increased costs would result. Any material increase in the Company’s financing costs or loss of access to cost-effective financing could have an adverse effect on its profitability, results of operations, and cash flows. Under some of its credit facilities, the Company is required to maintain certain specified financial ratios and pass certain financial tests. If the Company increases its level of debt or its operating results deteriorate, it may fail to meet these financial ratios or pass these tests, which may result in an event of default. In such an event, lenders may accelerate payment and the Company may be unable to continue to utilize these facilities. If the Company is unable to utilize these facilities or is required to repay debt earlier than management expected, it may not have sufficient cash available to make interest payments, to repay indebtedness, or for general corporate needs. General economic or business conditions, both domestic and foreign, may be less favorable than management expects and could adversely impact the Company’s sales or its ability to collect receivables from its customers, which may impact access to the Company’s accounts receivable securitization program.Financing covenants and restrictions may limit management discretionThe agreements governing the Company’s financing, including its credit facility, accounts receivable securitization program, and the indentures governing the Company’s outstanding notes, contain various covenants and restrictions that, in certain circumstances, limit the Company’s ability, and the ability of certain subsidiaries, to:●grant liens on assets;15●make restricted payments (including, under certain circumstances, paying dividends on, redeeming or repurchasing common stock);●make certain investments;●merge, consolidate, or transfer all, or substantially all, of the Company’s assets;●incur additional debt; or●engage in certain transactions with affiliates.As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the Company may be limited in the future in how it conducts its business and may be unable to raise additional debt, repurchase common stock, pay a dividend, compete effectively, or make further investments.Tax law changes and complianceAs a multinational corporation, the Company is subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States and many foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, governments enact or revise tax laws or regulations, including changes in the interpretation of such laws, that may adversely affect the Company’s cash flow and effective tax rate. Many countries are adopting provisions to align their international tax rules with the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, led by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and supported by the United States. The project aims to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, including with regard to tax rate increases and adopting a global minimum tax. In October 2021, a substantial majority of the OECD’s participating countries and jurisdictions agreed to introduce a 15% global minimum corporate tax rate that would apply to companies with revenue over a set threshold. Furthermore, many countries are independently evaluating their corporate tax policy, which could result in tax legislation and enforcement that adversely impacts the Company’s tax provision and value of deferred assets and liabilities. These provisions, if enacted, individually or as a whole, may negatively impact taxation of international business.The tax laws and regulations of the various countries where the Company has operations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although the Company believes that its historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable law, taxing authorities may challenge these tax positions and the Company may not be successful in defending against any such challenges.The Company’s future income tax expense could be favorably or adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets, and liabilities and changes to its operating structure.Constraints on internal controlsEffective internal controls are necessary for the Company to provide reliable financial reports, safeguard its assets, and prevent and detect fraud. If the Company cannot do so, its brand and operating results could be harmed. Internal controls over financial reporting are intended to prevent and detect material misstatements in its financial reporting and material fraudulent activity, but are limited by human error, circumventing or overriding controls, and fraud. As a result, the Company may not identify all material activity or all immaterial activity that could aggregate into a material misstatement. Therefore, even effective internal controls cannot guarantee that financial statements are wholly accurate or prevent all fraud and loss of assets. Management continually evaluates the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s internal controls. However, if the Company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved internal controls, or if the Company experiences 16Table of Contentsdifficulties in their implementation, the Company’s business and operating results could be harmed. Additionally, the Company may be subject to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities, or the Company could fail to meet its reporting obligations, all of which could have an adverse effect on its business or the market price of the Company’s securities.Acquisition expected benefits shortfallThe Company has made, and expects to continue to make, strategic acquisitions or investments globally to further its strategic objectives and support key business initiatives. Acquisitions and investments involve risks and uncertainties, some of which may differ from those associated with the Company’s historical operations. Such risks include, but are not limited to, risks relating to expanding into emerging markets and business areas, adding additional product lines and services, impacting existing customer and supplier relationships, incurring costs or liabilities associated with the companies acquired, incurring potential impairment charges on acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, and diverting management’s attention from existing business operations. As a result, the Company’s profitability may be negatively impacted. In addition, the Company may not successfully integrate the acquired businesses, or the integration may be more difficult, costly, or time-consuming than anticipated. Further, any litigation relating to a potential acquisition will increase expenses associated with the acquisition or cause a delay in completing the acquisition, which may impact the Company’s profitability. The Company may experience disruptions that could, depending on the size of the acquisition, have an adverse effect on its business, especially where an acquisition target may have pre-existing compliance issues or deficiencies, or material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting. Furthermore, the Company may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from its acquisitions, which could adversely affect the Company’s financial performance.Legal and Regulatory RisksLegal proceedings costs and damagesFrom time to time, the Company may become involved in legal proceedings, including government investigations, that arise out of the ordinary conduct of the Company’s business, including matters involving intellectual property rights, commercial matters, merger-related matters, product liability, and other actions. Legal proceedings could result in substantial costs and diversion of management’s efforts and other resources, and could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations and business reputation. The Company may be obligated to indemnify and defend its customers if the products or services that the Company sells are alleged to infringe any third party’s intellectual property rights. The Company may not be able to obtain supplier indemnification for itself and its customers against such claims, or such indemnification may not fully protect the Company and its customers against such claims. Also, the Company is exposed to potential liability for technology and products that it develops for which it has no indemnification protections. If an infringement claim against the Company is successful, the Company may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. The Company may have to stop selling certain products or services, which could affect its ability to compete effectively. In addition, the Company’s expanding business activities may include the assembly or manufacture of electronic component products and systems. Product defects, whether caused by a design, assembly, manufacture or component failure or error, or manufacturing processes not in compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, may result in product liability claims, product recalls, fines, and penalties. Product liability risks could be particularly significant with respect to aerospace, automotive, and medical applications because of the risk of serious harm to users of such products. 17Environmental regulations non-complianceThe Company is subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations addressing environmental and other impacts from industrial processes, waste disposal, carbon emissions, use of hazardous materials in products and operations, recycling products, and other related matters. While the Company strives to fully comply with all applicable regulations, certain of these regulations impose liability without fault. Additionally, the Company may be held responsible for the prior activities of an entity it acquired. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in substantial costs, fines, and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury. Future environmental laws and regulations may become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs, and increasing risks, penalties and reputational harm associated with violations.General Risk Factors
Negative impacts of a pandemic or other health crisis  on economy, operations, and financial resultsA pandemic, epidemic or other health related crisis could negatively impact the global economy, disrupt global supply chains, increase demand uncertainty, constrain workforce participation, disrupt logistics and distribution systems, and create significant volatility and disruption of financial markets, which could negatively impact the operations of the Company and its customers and suppliers. Such crises could also result in or heighten the risks of customer bankruptcies, customer delayed or defaulted payments, delays in product deliveries, restrictions on access to financial markets, and other risk factors described in the Company’s Annual Report. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, even though the Company has not yet experienced any material disruption to its upstream supply chain and many of its distribution centers remain operational under business continuity plans, it has experienced increased logistics costs, product demand fluctuations, product pricing challenges, longer lead times, reduction in global distribution center utilization, and shipping delays. As the scope and duration of the COVID-19 outbreak is unknown and the extent of its economic impact continues to evolve globally, there is significant uncertainty related to the ultimate impact that it will have on the Company’s business, its employees, product supply and demand, results of operations, and financial condition, and to what extent the Company’s actions to mitigate such impacts will be successful and sufficient.Economic and geopolitical uncertaintyThe Company’s financial results, operations, and prospects depend significantly on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions, the demand for its products and services, and the financial condition of its customers and suppliers. Economic weakness and geopolitical uncertainty (including the uncertainty caused by military conflicts; pandemics, epidemics, and other health related crises; and international trade disputes) have resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased sales, margins, and earnings. Economic weakness and geopolitical uncertainty may also lead the Company to impair assets (including goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets), implement restructuring actions, and reduce expenses in response to decreased sales or margins. The Company may not be able to adequately adjust its cost structure in a timely fashion, which may adversely impact its profitability. Uncertainty about economic conditions may increase foreign currency volatility, which may negatively impact the Company’s results. Economic weakness and geopolitical uncertainty also make it more difficult for the Company to manage inventory levels (including when customers decrease orders, cancel existing orders, or are unable to fulfill their obligations under non-cancelable/ non-return orders) and collect customer receivables, which may result in provisions to create reserves, write-offs, reduced access to liquidity, higher financing costs and increased pressure on cash flows. 18Table of ContentsFurther, an increase in or prolonged period of inflation could affect the Company’s profitability and cash flows, due to higher wages, higher operating expenses, higher financing costs, and/or higher supplier prices. Inflation may also adversely affect foreign exchange rates. The Company may be unable to pass along such higher costs to its customers, which may result in lower gross profit margins. In addition, Inflation may adversely affect customers’ financing costs, cash flows, and profitability, which could adversely impact their operations and the Company’s ability to offer credit and collect receivables.The Company is monitoring the implementation and effects of Brexit and developing contingency plans, including changes to its logistics operations and shipment routes, and preparing for changes in trade facilitation regulations. While the extent of the impact of Brexit is not yet fully known, Brexit has led to instability and uncertainty in the United Kingdom and the European Union, could contribute to logistical and regulatory delays at borders, and volatility in the foreign exchange markets, and may have an adverse effect on the Company’s trade operations and financial results.CompetitionThe market for the Company’s products and services is very competitive and subject to rapid technological advances, new competitors, non-traditional competitors, changes in industry standards, and changes in customer product demands and consumption models. The Company competes with other global and regional distributors, as well as some of the Company’s own suppliers that maintain direct sales efforts. In addition, as the Company expands its offerings and geographies, the Company may encounter increased competition from current or new competitors. The Company’s failure to maintain and enhance its competitive position could adversely affect its business and prospects. Furthermore, the Company’s efforts to compete in the marketplace could cause deterioration of gross profit margins and, thus, overall profitability.The size of the Company’s competitors varies across market sectors, as do the resources the Company has allocated to the sectors and geographic areas in which it does business. Therefore, some competitors may have greater resources or a more extensive customer or supplier base in some market sectors and geographic areas. As a result, the Company may not be able to effectively compete in certain markets, which could impact the Company’s profitability and prospects.Employee retention and hiring constraintsIdentifying, hiring, training, developing, and retaining qualified and engaged employees is critical to the Company’s success, and competition for experienced employees in the Company’s industry can be intense. Restrictions on immigration or changes in immigration laws, including visa restrictions, may limit the Company’s acquisition of key talent, including talent with diverse experience, background, ability, and perspectives. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers leave the Company. In addition, as global opportunities and industry demands shift, and as the Company expands its offerings, the Company may encounter challenges in realigning, training, and hiring skilled personnel. Through organizational design activities, the Company periodically eliminates positions due to restructurings or other reasons, which may risk the Company’s brand reputation as an employer of choice and negatively impact the Company’s ability to hire and retain qualified personnel. Also, position eliminations may negatively impact the morale of employees who are not terminated, which could result in work stoppages or slowdowns, particularly where employees are represented by unions or works councils. If these circumstances occur, the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations could be seriously harmed.​"

Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors
This Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) with respect to the financial condition, results of operations, and business of Avnet. These statements are generally identified by words like “believes,” “plans,” “projects,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “should,” “will,” “may,” “estimates,” or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, and actual results and other outcomes could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which that statement is made. Except as required by law, the Company does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date on which the statement is made.Risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements include the risk factors discussed below, but may also include risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that management does not currently consider material. Such factors make the Company’s operating results for future periods difficult to predict and, therefore, prior results do not necessarily indicate results in future periods except as disclosed. Some of the risks disclosed below may have already occurred, but not to a degree that management considers material. Any of the below factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, may have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, operating results, prospects, and liquidity. Similarly, the price of the Company’s common stock is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions; actual financial results that do not meet the Company’s or the investment community’s expectations; changes in the Company’s or the investment community’s expectations for the Company’s future results, dividends or share repurchases; and other factors, many of which are beyond the Company’s control.Business and Operations RisksChanges in customer needs and consumption modelsChanges in customer product demands and consumption models may cause a decline in the Company’s billings, which would have a negative impact on the Company’s financial results. While the Company attempts to identify changes in market conditions as soon as possible, the dynamics of the industries in which it operates make it difficult to predict and timely react to such changes, including those relating to product capacity and lead times. Also, future downturns or supply chain challenges in the semiconductor and embedded solutions industries could adversely affect the Company’s relationships with its customers, operating results, and profitability. In addition, the semiconductor industry experiences periodic fluctuations in product supply and demand (often associated with changes in economic conditions, technology, and manufacturing capacity) and suppliers may not adequately predict or meet customer demand. During fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, sales of semiconductors represented approximately 75%, 76%, and 77% of the Company’s consolidated sales, respectively, and the Company’s sales closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor industry. These conditions make it more difficult to manage the Company’s business and predict future performance.Due to the Company’s increased online sales, system interruptions and delays that make its websites and services unavailable or slow to respond may reduce the attractiveness of its products and services to its customers. If the Company is unable to continually improve the efficiency of its systems, it could cause systems interruptions or delays and adversely affect the Company’s operating results.8Table of ContentsDisruptions to key supplier and customer relationshipsOne of the Company’s competitive strengths is the breadth and quality of the suppliers whose products the Company distributes. For fiscal 2021, there were no Company suppliers that accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s consolidated billings. The Company’s contracts with its suppliers vary in duration and are generally terminable by either party at will upon notice. The Company’s suppliers may terminate or significantly reduce their volume of business with the Company, because of a product shortage, an unwillingness to do business with the Company, changes in strategy, or otherwise. Shortages of products or loss of a supplier may negatively affect the Company’s business and relationships with its customers could be negatively affected, as customers depend on the Company’s timely delivery of technology hardware and software from the industry’s leading suppliers. In addition, shifts in suppliers’ strategies, or performance and delivery issues, may negatively affect the Company’s financial results. These conditions make it more difficult to manage the Company’s business and predict future performance. The termination of the Company’s distribution contract with Texas Instruments (“TI”) (which had been one of the Company’s largest suppliers) was completed in December 2020. Sales from TI products represented approximately 9% and 10% of total sales in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively. The Company may experience lower sales and gross profits in the future if the impact of this termination is not offset over time by sales growth, gross margin improvements, and operating cost reductions.The competitive landscape has also experienced a consolidation among suppliers and capacity constraints, which could negatively impact the Company’s profitability and customer base. Further, if key suppliers modify the terms of their contracts (including, without limitation, terms regarding price protection, rights of return, delivery commitments, rebates, or other terms that protect or enhance the Company’s gross margins), it could negatively affect the Company’s results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.Risks related to international operationsDuring fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 approximately 78%, 75% and 75%, respectively, of the Company’s sales came from its operations outside the United States. The Company’s operations are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including, but not limited to, the following:●potential restrictions on the Company’s ability to repatriate funds from its foreign subsidiaries;●foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations;●non-compliance with foreign and domestic data privacy regulations, business licensing requirements, environmental regulations, and anti-corruption laws, the failure of which could result in severe penalties including monetary fines and criminal proceedings;●non-compliance with foreign and domestic import and export regulations and adoption or expansion of trade restrictions, including technology transfer restrictions, additional license, permit or authorization requirements for shipments, specific company sanctions, new and higher duties, tariffs or surcharges, or other import/export controls;●complex and changing tax laws and regulations; ●regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ between jurisdictions; ●economic and political instability, terrorism, and potential military conflicts or civilian unrest;●fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the 9transportation and shipping infrastructure;●natural disasters, pandemics, and other public health crises; ●differing employment practices and labor issues; and●non-compliance with local laws.In addition to the cost of compliance, the potential criminal penalties for violations of import or export regulations and anti-corruption laws, by the Company or its third-party agents, create heightened risks for the Company’s international operations. If a regulatory body determines that the Company has violated such laws, the Company could be fined significant sums, incur sizable legal defense costs, have its import or export capabilities restricted or denied, or have its inventories seized, which could have a material and adverse effect on the Company’s business. Additionally, allegations that the Company has violated any such regulations may negatively impact the Company’s reputation, which may result in customers or suppliers being unwilling to do business with the Company. While the Company has adopted measures and controls designed to ensure compliance with these laws, the Company cannot be assured that such measures will be adequate or that its business will not be materially and adversely impacted in the event of an alleged violation.Tariffs and trade restrictions resulting from international trade disputes or changes in trade policies may adversely affect the Company’s sales and profitability. For example, the U.S. government-imposed trade restrictions and new or higher tariffs on certain imported products. Additionally, several trade policies, rules, and restrictions applicable to China are now applicable to Hong Kong. In kind, the Chinese government has imposed trade restrictions, sanctions, and new or higher tariffs on U.S. imports into China. These actions have resulted in increased costs, including increased costs of procuring certain products the Company purchases from its suppliers, and other related expenses, which may impact the Company’s sales and customer demand for certain products. In addition, increased operational expenses incurred in minimizing the number of products subject to the tariffs could adversely affect the Company’s operating profits. Neither U.S. tariffs nor any retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods have yet had a material impact, but any future actions or escalations that affect trade relations could materially affect the Company’s sales and results of operations. The Company transacts sales, pays expenses, owns assets, and incurs liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Because the Company’s consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars, the Company must translate such activities and amounts into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect during each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and other currencies affect the Company’s reported amounts of sales, operating income, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, unexpected and dramatic changes in foreign currency exchange rates may negatively affect the Company’s earnings from those markets. While the Company may use derivative financial instruments to reduce its net exposure, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may materially affect the Company’s financial results. Further, foreign currency instability and disruptions in the credit and capital markets may increase credit risks for some of the Company’s customers and may impair its customers’ ability to repay existing obligations.Internal information systems failuresThe Company depends on its information systems to facilitate its day-to-day operations and to produce timely, accurate, and reliable information on financial and operational results. Currently, the Company’s global operations are tracked with multiple information systems, some of which are subject to ongoing IT projects designed to streamline or optimize the Company’s systems. These IT projects are extremely complex, in part because of wide ranging processes, multiple legacy systems used, and the Company’s business operations. The Company may not always succeed at these efforts. Implementation or integration difficulties may adversely affect the Company’s ability to complete business transactions and ensure accurate recording and reporting of financial data. In addition, IT projects may not achieve the 10Table of Contentsexpected efficiencies and cost savings, which could negatively impact the Company’s financial results. A failure of any of these information systems in a way described above, or material difficulties in upgrading these information systems, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, internal controls, and reporting obligations under federal securities laws.Logistics disruptionsThe Company’s global logistics services are operated through specialized and centralized distribution centers around the globe, some of which are outsourced. The Company also depends almost entirely on third-party transportation service providers to deliver products to its customers. A major interruption or disruption in service at one or more of its distribution centers for any reason (such as information technology upgrades and operating issues, warehouse modernization and relocation efforts, natural disasters, pandemics, or significant disruptions of services from the Company’s third-party transportation providers) could cause an increase in expenses or a delay in expected cost savings. In addition, as the Company continues to increase capacity at its distribution center in Leeds, England, it may experience operational challenges, increases costs, decreased efficiency, and customer delivery delays and failures. Such operational challenges could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business partners, and on the Company’s business, operations, financial performance, and reputation.Data security and privacy threatsThreats to the Company’s data and information technology systems (including phishing, cyber-attacks, and ransomware) are becoming more frequent and sophisticated. Threat actors have successfully breached the Company’s systems in various ways, and such security breaches expose the Company to significant potential liability and reputational harm. Security breaches have not yet materially impacted the Company’s operations, financial condition, or data security and privacy, but future security breaches could have a material impact. Threat actors seek unauthorized access to intellectual property, or confidential or proprietary information regarding the Company, its customers, or its business partners. They deploy malicious software programs that exploit security vulnerabilities, including ransomware designed to encrypt the Company’s files so an attacker may demand a ransom for restored access. They also seek to misdirect money, sabotage data and systems, and induce employees or other system users to disclose sensitive information, including login credentials. Further, the Company’s business partners and service providers, such as hosted solution providers, pose a security risk because their own security systems or infrastructure may be compromised. The Company incurs significant costs to prevent and detect these risks, as well as to respond to security breaches as they occur. However, the Company’s efforts are not fully successful. Threat actors frequently change their techniques and, consequently, the Company does not always promptly detect the existence or scope of a security breach. As these types of threats grow and evolve, the Company may make further investments to protect its data and information technology infrastructure, which may impact the Company’s profitability. The Company’s insurance coverage for protecting against cyber-attacks may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims, and the Company may suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on its business. As a global enterprise, the Company may be negatively impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices, related to cybersecurity, data privacy, data localization, and data protection.Financial RisksInventory value declineThe electronic components and integrated products industries are subject to rapid technological change, new and enhanced products, changes in customer needs, and changes in industry standards and regulatory requirements, which can cause the Company’s inventory to decline in value or become obsolete. Regardless of the general economic environment, prices may decline due to a decrease in demand or an oversupply of products, which may increase the risk 11of declines in inventory value. Many of the Company’s suppliers offer certain protections from the loss in value of inventory (such as price protection and limited rights of return), but such policies may not fully compensate for the loss. Also, suppliers may not honor such agreements, some of which are subject to the supplier discretion. In addition, most Company sales are made pursuant to individual purchase orders, rather than through long-term sales contracts. Where there are contracts, such contracts are generally terminable at will upon notice. Unforeseen customer cancellations may adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.Accounts receivable defaultsAccounts receivable are a significant portion of the Company’s working capital. If entities responsible for a significant amount of accounts receivable cease doing business, direct their business elsewhere, fail to pay, or delay payment, the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity could be adversely affected. An economic or industry downturn could adversely affect the Company’s ability to collect receivables, which could result in longer payment cycles, increased collection costs, and defaults exceeding management’s expectations. A significant deterioration in the Company’s ability to collect accounts receivable in the United States could impact the cost or availability of financing under its accounts receivable securitization program. Liquidity and capital resources constraintsThe Company’s ability to satisfy its cash needs and implement its capital allocation strategy depends on its ability to generate cash from operations and to access the financial markets, both of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond the Company’s control. The Company may need to satisfy its cash needs through external financing. However, various factors affect external financing, including general market conditions and the Company’s debt ratings and operating results, and may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. An increase in the Company’s debt or deterioration of its operating results may cause a reduction in its debt ratings. Any such reduction could negatively impact the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing or renew existing financing, and could result in reduced credit limits, increased financing expenses, and additional restrictions and covenants. A reduction in its current debt rating may also negatively impact the Company’s working capital and impair its relationship with its customers and suppliers.As of July 3, 2021, Avnet had debt outstanding with financial institutions under various notes, secured borrowings, and committed and uncommitted lines of credit. The Company needs cash to pay debt principal and interest, and for general corporate purposes, such as funding its ongoing working capital and capital expenditure needs. Under certain of its credit facilities, the applicable interest rate and costs are based in part on the Company’s current debt rating. If its debt rating is reduced, higher interest rates and increased costs would result. In addition, some of its debt utilizes the LIBOR rate, which the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority intends to phase out by the end of 2021. At this time, it is uncertain how markets will respond to the discontinuation of LIBOR or to the proposed alternative rates, which may result in increased costs and higher interest rates. Any material increase in the Company’s financing costs or loss of access to cost-effective financing could have an adverse effect on its profitability, results of operations, and cash flows. Under some of its credit facilities, the Company is required to maintain certain specified financial ratios and pass certain financial tests. If the Company increases its level of debt or its operating results deteriorate, it may fail to meet these financial ratios or pass these tests, which may result in an event of default. In such an event, lenders may accelerate payment and the Company may be unable to continue to utilize these facilities. If the Company is unable to utilize these facilities or is required to repay debt earlier than management expected, it may not have sufficient cash available to make interest payments, to repay indebtedness, or for general corporate needs. 12Table of ContentsGeneral economic or business conditions, both domestic and foreign, may be less favorable than management expects and could adversely impact the Company’s sales or its ability to collect receivables from its customers, which may impact access to the Company’s accounts receivable securitization program.Financing covenants and restrictions may limit management discretionThe agreements governing the Company’s financing, including its credit facility, accounts receivable securitization program, and the indentures governing the Company’s outstanding notes, contain various covenants and restrictions that, in certain circumstances, limit the Company’s ability, and the ability of certain subsidiaries, to:●grant liens on assets;●make restricted payments (including, under certain circumstances, paying dividends on common stock, or redeeming or repurchasing common stock);●make certain investments;●merge, consolidate, or transfer all, or substantially all, of the Company’s assets;●incur additional debt; or●engage in certain transactions with affiliates.As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the Company may be limited in the future in how it conducts its business and may be unable to raise additional debt, repurchase common stock, pay a dividend, compete effectively, or make further investments.Tax law changes and complianceAs a multinational corporation, the Company is subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States and many foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, governments enact new tax laws or regulations that could adversely affect the Company’s tax positions. Also, changes to current tax laws or regulations, including changes in the interpretation of such laws, may adversely affect the Company’s cash flow and effective tax rate. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Among other things, the CARES Act permits net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks to offset 100% of taxable income for taxable years beginning before 2021. In addition, the CARES Act allows net operating losses incurred in fiscal 2019, 2020, and 2021 to be carried back to each of the five preceding taxable fiscal years to generate a refund of previously paid income taxes. The CARES Act is subject to interpretation and implementation guidance by both federal and state tax authorities, as well as amendments and technical corrections. Any or all of these could impact the Company unfavorably.Many countries are adopting provisions to align their international tax rules with the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, led by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and supported by the United States. The project aims to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, including with regard to tax rate increases and adopting a global minimum tax. These provisions, individually or as a whole, may negatively impact taxation of international business.The tax laws and regulations of the various countries where the Company has operations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although the Company believes that its historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable law, taxing authorities may challenge these tax positions and the Company may not be successful in defending against any such challenges.13The Company’s future income tax expense could be favorably or adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets, and liabilities and changes to its operating structure.Constraints on internal financial controlsEffective internal controls are necessary for the Company to provide reliable financial reports, safeguard its assets, and prevent and detect fraud. If the Company cannot do so, its brand and operating results could be harmed. Internal controls over financial reporting are intended to prevent and detect material misstatements in its financial reporting and material fraudulent activity. Internal controls are limited, including limits related to human error, circumventing or overriding controls, and fraud. As a result, the Company may not identify all material activity or all immaterial activity that could aggregate into a material misstatement. Therefore, even effective internal controls cannot guarantee that financial statements are wholly accurate or prevent all fraud and loss of assets. Management continually evaluates the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s internal controls. However, if the Company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved internal controls, or if the Company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the Company’s business and operating results could be harmed. Additionally, the Company may be subject to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities, or the Company could fail to meet its reporting obligations, all of which could have an adverse effect on its business or the market price of the Company’s securities.Acquisition expected benefits shortfallAvnet has made, and expects to continue to make, strategic acquisitions or investments globally to further its strategic objectives and support key business initiatives. Acquisitions and investments involve risks and uncertainties, some of which may differ from those associated with Avnet’s historical operations. Such risks include, but are not limited to, risks relating to expanding into emerging markets and business areas, adding additional product lines and services, impacting existing customer and supplier relationships, incurring costs or liabilities associated with the companies acquired, incurring potential impairment charges on acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, and diverting management’s attention from existing business operations. As a result, the Company’s profitability may be negatively impacted. In addition, the Company may not successfully integrate the acquired businesses, or the integration may be more difficult, costly, or time-consuming than anticipated. Further, any litigation relating to a potential acquisition will increase expenses associated with the acquisition or cause a delay in completing the acquisition, which may impact the Company’s profitability. The Company may experience disruptions that could, depending on the size of the acquisition, have an adverse effect on its business, especially where an acquisition target may have pre-existing compliance issues or deficiencies, or material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting. Furthermore, the Company may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from its acquisitions, which could adversely affect the Company’s financial performance.Legal and Regulatory RisksLegal proceedingsFrom time to time, the Company may become involved in legal proceedings, including government investigations, that arise out of the ordinary conduct of the Company’s business, including matters involving intellectual property rights, commercial matters, merger-related matters, product liability, and other actions. Legal proceedings could result in substantial costs and diversion of management’s efforts and other resources, and could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations and business reputation. The Company may be obligated to indemnify and defend its customers if the products or services that the Company sells are alleged to infringe any third party’s intellectual property rights. The 14Table of ContentsCompany may not be able to obtain supplier indemnification for itself and its customers against such claims, or such indemnification may not fully protect the Company and its customers against such claims. Also, the Company is exposed to potential liability for technology and products that it develops for which it has no indemnification protections. If an infringement claim against the Company is successful, the Company may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. The Company may have to stop selling certain products or services, which could affect its ability to compete effectively. In addition, the Company’s expanding business activities may include the assembly or manufacture of electronic component products and systems. Product defects, whether caused by a design, assembly, manufacture or component failure or error, or manufacturing processes not in compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, may result in product liability claims, product recalls, fines, and penalties. Product liability risks could be particularly significant with respect to aerospace, automotive, and medical applications because of the risk of serious harm to users of such products. Environmental regulationsThe Company is subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations addressing environmental and other impacts from industrial processes, waste disposal, carbon emissions, use of hazardous materials in products and operations, recycling products, and other related matters. While the Company strives to fully comply with all applicable regulations, certain of these regulations impose liability without fault. Additionally, the Company may be held responsible for the prior activities of an entity it acquired. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in substantial costs, fines, and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury. Further, environmental laws may become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs, and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations.General Risk Factors
COVID-19 impacts on economy, operations, and financial resultsThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, increased demand uncertainty, created supply chain and forecasting challenges, and disrupted logistics and distribution systems. As a result, this pandemic has negatively impacted the operations of the Company and its customers and suppliers, and resulted in or heightened the risks of customer bankruptcies, customer delayed or defaulted payments, product supply constraints, delays in product deliveries, restrictions on access to financial markets, and other risk factors described in the Company’s Annual Report. While the Company has not yet experienced any material disruption to its upstream supply chain and many of its distribution centers remain operational under business continuity plans, it has experienced increased logistics costs, product demand fluctuations, product pricing challenges, longer lead times, reduction in global distribution center utilization, and shipping delays. As the scope and duration of the COVID-19 outbreak is unknown and the extent of its economic impact continues to evolve globally, there is significant uncertainty related to the ultimate impact that it will have on the Company’s business, its employees, product supply and demand, results of operations, and financial condition, and to what extent the Company’s actions to mitigate such impacts will be successful and sufficient.Economic and geopolitical uncertaintyThe Company’s financial results, operations, and prospects depend significantly on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions, the demand for its products and services, and the financial condition of its customers and suppliers. Economic weakness and geopolitical uncertainty (including the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and international trade disputes) have resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased sales, margins, and earnings. Economic weakness and geopolitical uncertainty may also lead the Company to impair assets (including goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets) and increase restructuring expenses to reduce expenses in 15response to decreased sales or margins. The Company may not be able to adequately adjust its cost structure in a timely fashion, which may adversely impact its profitability. Uncertainty about economic conditions may increase foreign currency volatility, which may negatively impact the Company’s results. Economic weakness and geopolitical uncertainty also make it more difficult for the Company to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables, which may result in provisions to create reserves, write-offs, reduced access to liquidity, and higher financing costs. Further, an increase in inflation rates could affect the Company’s profitability and cash flows, due to higher wages, higher operating costs, higher financing costs, and/or higher supplier prices. Inflation may also adversely affect foreign exchange rates. The Company may be unable to pass along such higher costs to its customers. In addition, Inflation may adversely affect customers’ financing costs, cash flows, and profitability, which could adversely impact their operations and the Company’s ability to offer credit and collect receivables.The Company is monitoring the implementation and effects of Brexit and developing contingency plans, including changes to its logistics operations and shipment routes, and preparing for changes in trade facilitation regulations. While the extent of the impact of Brexit is not yet fully known, Brexit has led to instability and uncertainty in the United Kingdom and the European Union, could contribute to logistical and regulatory delays at borders, and volatility in the foreign exchange markets, and may have an adverse effect on the Company’s trade operations and financial results.CompetitionThe market for the Company’s products and services is very competitive and subject to rapid technological advances, new competitors, non-traditional competitors, changes in industry standards, and changes in customer product demands and consumption models. The Company competes with other global and regional distributors, as well as some of the Company’s own suppliers that maintain direct sales efforts. In addition, as the Company expands its offerings and geographies, the Company may encounter increased competition from current or new competitors. The Company’s failure to maintain and enhance its competitive position could adversely affect its business and prospects. Furthermore, the Company’s efforts to compete in the marketplace could cause deterioration of gross profit margins and, thus, overall profitability.The size of the Company’s competitors varies across market sectors, as do the resources the Company has allocated to the sectors and geographic areas in which it does business. Therefore, some competitors may have greater resources or a more extensive customer or supplier base in some market sectors and geographic areas. As a result, the Company may not be able to effectively compete in certain markets, which could impact the Company’s profitability and prospects.Employee retention and hiring constraintsIdentifying, hiring, training, developing, and retaining qualified employees is critical to the Company’s success, and competition for experienced employees in the Company’s industry can be intense. Restrictions on immigration or changes in immigration laws, including visa restrictions, may limit the Company’s acquisition of key talent. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers leave the Company. In addition, as global opportunities and industry demands shift, and as the Company expands its offerings, the Company may not adequately realign, train, and hire skilled personnel. The Company periodically eliminates positions due to organizational restructurings or other reasons, which may damage the Company’s reputation as an employer and negatively impact the Company’s ability to hire and retain qualified personnel. Also, position eliminations may negatively impact the morale of employees who are not terminated, which could result in work stoppages or slowdowns, particularly where employees are represented by unions or works councils. If these circumstances occur, the Company’s 16Table of Contentsbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations could be seriously harmed.​"

Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors
This Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) with respect to the financial condition, results of operations and business of Avnet. These statements are generally identified by words like “believes,” “plans,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “should,” “will,” “may,” “estimates” or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, and actual results and other outcomes could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which that statement is made. Except as required by law, the Company does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date on which the statement is made.Risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements include the risk factors discussed below, but may also include risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that management does not currently consider material. Such factors make the Company’s operating results for future periods difficult to predict and, therefore, prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. Any of the below factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, may have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, operating results, prospects and liquidity. Similarly, the price of the Company’s common stock is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions; actual financial results that do not meet the Company’s or the investment community’s expectations; changes in the Company’s or the investment community’s expectations for the Company’s future results, dividends or share repurchases; and other factors, many of which are beyond the Company’s control.The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, impacted the operations of the Company and its business partners and negatively impacted the Company’s operations and financial results.The COVID-19 outbreak has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, constrained workforce participation due to travel restrictions and quarantine orders, disrupted logistics and distribution systems, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. As a result, this pandemic has negatively impacted the operations of the Company and its customers and suppliers, and resulted in or heightened the risks of customer bankruptcies, customer delayed or defaulted payments, acceleration of TI’s planned withdrawal as a supplier, restrictions on access to financial markets and other risk factors described in the Company’s Annual Report. While the Company has not yet experienced any material disruption to its upstream supply chain and many of its distribution centers remain operational under business continuity plans, it has experienced increased logistics costs, softer product demand, price constraints, longer lead times in certain regions, reduction in global distribution center utilization, and shipping delays. To mitigate the impact of COVID-19, the Company has implemented business continuity plans, with a focus on employee safety and mitigation of business disruptions. The Company is also taking steps to conserve cash and 7effectively manage its debt. As the scope and duration of the COVID-19 outbreak is unknown and the extent of its economic impact continues to evolve globally, there is significant uncertainty related to the ultimate impact that it will have on the Company’s business, its employees, results of operations and financial condition, and to what extent the Company’s actions to mitigate such impacts will be successful and sufficient.Economic weakness and geopolitical uncertainty could adversely affect the Company’s results and prospects.The Company’s financial results, operations and prospects depend significantly on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions, the demand for its products and services, and the financial condition of its customers and suppliers. Economic weakness and geopolitical uncertainty, including the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union commonly referred to as “Brexit,” have in the past resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased sales, margins and earnings. Economic weakness and geopolitical uncertainty may also lead the Company to impair assets, including goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets, and increased restructuring expenses to reduce expenses in response to decreased sales or margins. The Company may not be able to adequately adjust its cost structure in a timely fashion, which may adversely impact its profitability. Uncertainty about economic conditions may increase foreign currency volatility in markets in which the Company transacts business, which may negatively impact the Company’s results. Economic weakness and geopolitical uncertainty also make it more difficult for the Company to manage inventory levels and/or collect customer receivables, which may result in provisions to create reserves, write-offs, reduced access to liquidity and higher financing costs.The Company is monitoring the implementation and effects of Brexit and developing contingency plans, including changes to its logistics operations and shipment routes and preparing for changes in trade facilitation regulations. While the extent of the impact of Brexit is not yet fully known, Brexit has led to instability and uncertainty in the United Kingdom and the European Union, could contribute to logistical and regulatory delays at borders and volatility in the foreign exchange markets and may have an adverse effect on the Company’s trade operations and financial results.The Company experiences significant competitive pressure, which may negatively impact its results.The market for the Company’s products and services is very competitive and subject to rapid technological advances, new market entrants, non-traditional competitors, changes in industry standards and changes in customer needs and consumption models. Not only does the Company compete with other global distributors, it also competes for customers with regional distributors and some of the Company’s own suppliers that maintain direct sales efforts. In addition, as the Company expands its offerings and geographies, the Company may encounter increased competition from current or new competitors. The Company’s failure to maintain and enhance its competitive position could adversely affect its business and prospects. Furthermore, the Company’s efforts to compete in the marketplace could cause deterioration of gross profit margins and, thus, overall profitability.The size of the Company’s competitors varies across market sectors, as do the resources the Company has allocated to the sectors and geographic areas in which it does business. Therefore, some competitors may have greater resources or a more extensive customer or supplier base than the Company has in one or more of its market sectors and geographic areas, which may result in the Company not being able to effectively compete in certain markets which could impact the Company’s profitability and prospects.Changes in customer needs and consumption models could significantly affect the Company’s operating results.Changes in customer needs and consumption models may cause a decline in the Company’s billings, which would have a negative impact on the Company’s financial results. While the Company attempts to identify changes in market conditions as soon as possible, the dynamics of the industries in which it operates make prediction of, and timely 8Table of Contentsreaction to, such changes difficult. Future downturns in the semiconductor and embedded solutions industries could adversely affect the Company’s operating results and negatively impact the Company’s ability to maintain its current profitability levels. In addition, the semiconductor industry has historically experienced periodic fluctuations in product supply and demand, often associated with changes in economic conditions, technology and manufacturing capacity. During fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, sales of semiconductors represented approximately 76%, 77%, and 78% of the Company's consolidated sales, respectively, and the Company’s sales closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor industry.Due to the Company’s increased online sales, system interruptions and delays that make its websites and services unavailable or slow to respond may reduce the attractiveness of its products and services to its customers. If the Company is unable to continually improve the efficiency of its systems, it could cause systems interruptions or delays and adversely affect the Company’s operating results.Failure to maintain or develop new relationships with key suppliers could adversely affect the Company’s sales.One of the Company’s competitive strengths is the breadth and quality of the suppliers whose products the Company distributes. For fiscal 2020, there were no Company suppliers which accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s consolidated billings. The Company’s contracts with its suppliers vary in duration and are generally terminable by either party at will upon notice. To the extent any primary suppliers terminate or significantly reduce their volume of business with the Company because of a product shortage, an unwillingness to do business with the Company, changes in strategy or otherwise, the Company’s business and relationships with its customers could be negatively affected because its customers depend on the Company’s distribution of technology hardware and software from the industry’s leading suppliers. In addition, suppliers’ strategy shifts or performance issues may negatively affect the Company’s financial results. During the second quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company received notification from one of its largest suppliers Texas Instruments Incorporated (“TI”) that it planned to terminate the Company’s distribution agreement by December 31, 2020 due to the evolution of its strategy. Sales from TI products represented approximately 9% and 10% of total sales in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively. If the impact of this termination is not offset over time by sales growth, gross margin improvements or operating cost reductions, the Company will experience lower sales and gross profits in the future. The competitive landscape has also experienced a consolidation among suppliers, which could negatively impact the Company’s profitability and customer base. Further, to the extent that any of the Company’s key suppliers modify the terms of their contracts including, without limitation, the terms regarding price protection, rights of return, rebates or other terms that protect or enhance the Company’s gross margins, it could negatively affect the Company’s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.The Company’s non-U.S. locations represent a significant portion of its sales and, consequently, the Company is exposed to risks associated with operating internationally that could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.During fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 approximately 75%, 75% and 76%, respectively, of the Company’s sales came from its operations outside the United States. As a result of the Company’s international operations, in particular those in emerging and developing economies, the Company’s operations are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including, but not limited to, the following:●potential restrictions on the Company’s ability to repatriate funds from its foreign subsidiaries;●foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations and the impact on the Company’s results of operations;●compliance with foreign and domestic data privacy regulations, business licensing requirements, environmental 9regulations and anti-corruption laws, the failure of which could result in severe penalties including monetary fines and criminal proceedings;●Compliance with foreign and domestic import and export regulations and adoption or expansion of trade restrictions, including technology transfer restrictions, additional license, permit or authorization requirements for shipments, specific company sanctions, new and higher duties, tariffs or surcharges, or other import/export controls, unilaterally or bilaterally;●complex and changing tax laws and regulations; ●regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ between jurisdictions; ●economic and political instability (including the uncertainty caused by Brexit), terrorism and potential military conflicts or civilian unrest;●fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure;●natural disasters, pandemics and other public health crises; ●differing environmental regulations and employment practices and labor issues; and●the risk of non-compliance with local laws.In addition to the cost of compliance, the potential criminal penalties for violations of import or export regulations and anti-corruption laws by the Company or its third-party agents create heightened risks for the Company’s international operations. In the event that a governing regulatory body determines that the Company has violated applicable import or export regulations or anti-corruption laws, the Company could be fined significant sums, incur sizable legal defense costs, have its import or export capabilities restricted or denied and/or have its inventories seized, which could have a material and adverse effect on the Company’s business. Additionally, allegations that the Company has violated a governmental regulation may negatively impact the Company’s reputation, which may result in customers or suppliers being unwilling to do business with the Company. While the Company has adopted measures and controls designed to ensure compliance with these laws, the Company cannot be assured that such measures will be adequate or that its business will not be materially and adversely impacted in the event of an alleged violation.The Company transacts sales, pays expenses, owns assets and incurs liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Because the Company’s consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars, the Company must translate sales, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect during each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and other currencies affect the Company’s reported amounts of sales, operating income, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, unexpected and dramatic changes in foreign currency exchange rates may negatively affect the Company’s earnings from those markets. While the Company may use derivative financial instruments to further reduce its net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will not materially affect the Company’s financial results. Further, foreign currency instability and disruptions in the credit and capital markets may increase credit risks for some of the Company’s customers and may impair its customers’ ability to repay existing obligations.The U.S. government imposed new or higher tariffs on certain products imported into the U.S., and the Chinese government imposed new or higher tariffs on certain products imported into China. New trade policies, regulations, license requirements and restrictions affecting sales and shipments to specific China-based customers and of certain U.S. commodities and technologies to China have also been implemented. Additionally, several trade policies, rules and 10Table of Contentsrestrictions applicable to China are now applicable to Hong Kong. These actions have resulted in increased costs, including increased costs of procuring certain products the Company purchases from its suppliers, and other related expenses. While the Company intends to reflect such increased costs in its selling prices, such price increases may impact the Company’s sales and customer demand for certain products. In addition, increased operational expenses incurred in minimizing the number of products subject to the tariffs could adversely affect the operating profits for certain of its business units. Neither such U.S. tariffs nor any retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods have yet had a material impact, but there can be no assurance that future actions or escalations that affect trade relations will not occur or will not materially affect the Company’s sales and results of operations. To the extent that Company sales or profitability are negatively affected by any such tariffs or other trade actions, the Company’s business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.If the Company’s internal information systems fail to function properly, or if the Company is unsuccessful in the implementation, integration or upgrade of information systems, its business operations could suffer.The Company is dependent on its information systems to facilitate the day-to-day operations of the business and to produce timely, accurate and reliable information on financial and operational results. Currently, the Company’s global operations are tracked with multiple information systems, some of which are subject to ongoing IT projects designed to streamline or optimize the Company’s global information systems. These IT projects are extremely complex, in part, because of a wide range of processes, the multiple legacy systems used and the Company’s business operations. There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful at all times in these efforts or that there will not be implementation or integration difficulties that will adversely affect the Company’s ability to complete business transactions and ensure accurate recording and reporting of financial data. In addition, the Company may be unable to achieve the expected efficiencies and cost savings as a result of the IT projects, thus negatively impacting the Company’s financial results. A failure of any of these information systems in a way described above or material difficulties in upgrading these information systems could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, internal controls and reporting obligations under federal securities laws.Major disruptions to the Company’s logistics capability could have an adverse impact on the Company’s operations.The Company’s global logistics services are operated through specialized, centralized or outsourced distribution centers around the globe. The Company also depends almost entirely on third-party transportation service providers for the delivery of products to its customers. A major interruption or disruption in service at one or more of its distribution centers for any reason (such as information technology upgrades and operating issues, warehouse modernization and relocation efforts, natural disasters, pandemics, or significant disruptions of services from the Company’s third-party transportation providers) could cause cancellations or delays in a significant number of shipments to customers and, as a result, could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business partners, and on the Company’s business, operations and financial performance.If the Company sustains cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches, it could suffer a loss of sales and increased costs, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm and other negative consequences.The Company’s information technology may be subject to cyber-attacks, security breaches or computer hacking. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate the Company’s security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal, proprietary or confidential information, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. They also may be able to develop and deploy malicious software programs that attack the Company’s systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities, including ransomware that could encrypt the Company’s files so an attacker may demand a ransom for restored access. The Company’s systems and the data stored on those systems 11may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks, acts of vandalism or theft, coordinated attacks by activist entities, misplaced or lost data, human errors, or other similar events that could negatively affect the Company’s systems and its data, as well as the data of the Company’s business partners. Further, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or suppliers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the Company’s data and information technology systems or to misdirect payments, otherwise known as phishing. Lastly, third parties, such as hosted solution providers, that provide services to the Company, could also be a source of security risk in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure.The costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be significant. The Company’s remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential suppliers or customers. In addition, breaches of the Company’s security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal, proprietary or confidential information about the Company, its business partners or other third parties could expose the Company to significant potential liability and reputational harm. As threats related to cyber-attacks develop and grow, the Company may also find it necessary to make further investments to protect its data and infrastructure, which may impact the Company’s profitability. Although the Company has insurance coverage for protecting against cyber-attacks, it may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims and the Company may suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on its business. As a global enterprise, the Company could also be negatively impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, data privacy, data localization and data protection.Declines in the value of the Company’s inventory or unexpected order cancellations by the Company’s customers could adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.The electronic components and integrated products industries are subject to rapid technological change, new and enhanced products, changes in customer needs and changes in industry standards and regulatory requirements, which can contribute to a decline in value or obsolescence of inventory. Regardless of the general economic environment, it is possible that prices will decline due to a decrease in demand or an oversupply of products and, as a result of the price declines, there may be greater risk of declines in inventory value. Although it is the policy of many of the Company’s suppliers to offer certain protections from the loss in value of inventory (such as price protection and limited rights of return), the Company cannot be assured that such policies will fully compensate for the loss in value, or that the suppliers will choose to, or be able to, honor such agreements, some of which are not documented and, therefore, subject to the discretion of the supplier. In addition, the majority of the Company’s sales are made pursuant to individual purchase orders, rather than through long-term sales contracts. Where there is a contract, such contract is generally terminable at will upon notice. The Company cannot be assured that unforeseen new product developments, declines in the value of the Company’s inventory or unforeseen order cancellations by its customers will not adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.Substantial defaults by the Company’s customers or suppliers on its accounts receivable or the loss of significant customers could have a significant negative impact on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.A significant portion of the Company’s working capital consists of accounts receivable. If entities responsible for a significant amount of accounts receivable were to cease doing business, direct their business elsewhere, become insolvent or unable to pay the amount they owe the Company, or were to become unwilling or unable to make such payments in a timely manner, the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected. An economic or industry downturn could adversely affect the collectability of these accounts receivable, which could result in longer payment cycles, increased collection costs and defaults in excess of management’s expectations. A significant deterioration in the Company’s ability to collect on accounts receivable in the 12Table of ContentsUnited States could also impact the cost or availability of financing under its accounts receivable securitization program.The Company may not have adequate or cost-effective liquidity or capital resources which could adversely affect the Company’s operations.The Company’s ability to satisfy its cash needs and implement its capital allocation strategy depends on its ability to generate cash from operations and to access the financial markets, both of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond the Company’s control. The Company may need to satisfy its cash needs through external financing. However, external financing is affected by various factors, including general market conditions as well as the Company’s debt ratings and operating results, and may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. An increase in the Company’s level of debt or deterioration of its operating results may cause a reduction in its current debt ratings, which could negatively impact the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing or renew existing financing and could result in a reduction of its credit limits, increased financing expenses and subject the Company to additional restrictions and covenants. A reduction in its current debt rating may also negatively impact the Company’s working capital and impair its relationship with its customers and suppliers.As of June 27, 2020, Avnet had debt outstanding under various notes, secured borrowings and committed and uncommitted lines of credit with financial institutions. The Company needs cash to make interest payments on, and to repay, this indebtedness and for general corporate purposes, such as funding its ongoing working capital and capital expenditure needs. Under certain of its credit facilities, the applicable interest rate and costs are based in part on the Company’s current debt rating. If its debt rating is reduced, higher interest rates and increased costs would result. In addition, certain of its debt utilizes the LIBOR rate, which the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority has announced that it intends to phase out by the end of 2021. At this time, it is uncertain how markets will respond to the discontinuation of LIBOR or to the proposed alternative rates, and may result in increased costs and higher interest rates. Any material increase in the Company’s financing costs or loss of access to cost-effective financing could have an adverse effect on its profitability, results of operations and cash flows. Under certain of its credit facilities, the Company is required to maintain certain specified financial ratios and pass certain financial tests. If the Company increases its level of debt or experiences a deterioration of its operating results, it may fail to meet these financial ratios and/or pass these tests, which may result in an event of default, whereby lenders may accelerate payment and the Company may be unable to continue to utilize these facilities. If the Company is unable to utilize these facilities or is required to repay debt earlier than management expected, it may not have sufficient cash available to make interest payments, to repay indebtedness or for general corporate needs. General economic or business conditions, domestic and foreign, may be less favorable than management expects and could adversely impact the Company’s sales or its ability to collect receivables from its customers, which may impact access to the Company’s accounts receivable securitization program.The agreements governing some of the Company’s financings contain various covenants and restrictions that limit management’s discretion in operating the business and could prevent management from engaging in some activities that may be beneficial to the Company’s business.The agreements governing the Company’s financing, including its credit facility, accounts receivable securitization program and the indentures governing the Company’s outstanding notes, contain various covenants and restrictions that, in certain circumstances, limit the Company’s ability, and the ability of certain subsidiaries, to:●grant liens on assets;●make restricted payments (including, under certain circumstances, paying dividends on common stock or redeeming or repurchasing common stock);13●make certain investments;●merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of the Company’s assets;●incur additional debt; or●engage in certain transactions with affiliates.As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the Company may be limited in the future in how it conducts its business and may be unable to raise additional debt, repurchase common stock, pay a dividend, compete effectively or make further investments.Changes in tax rules and regulations, changes in interpretation of tax rules and regulations, changes in business performance or unfavorable assessments from tax audits could adversely affect the Company’s effective tax rates, deferred taxes, financial condition and results of operations.As a multinational corporation, the Company is subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States and many foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, regulations may be enacted that could adversely affect the Company’s tax positions. There can be no assurance that the Company’s cash flow, and in some cases the effective tax rate, will not be adversely affected by these potential changes in regulations or by changes in the interpretation of existing tax law and regulations. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted tax legislation (the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” or the “Act”) which includes provisions to lower the corporate income tax rate, impose new taxes on certain foreign earnings, limit deductibility of certain U.S. costs and levy a one-time deemed repatriation tax on accumulated offshore earnings, among others. The Act is subject to interpretation and implementation guidance by both federal and state tax authorities, as well as amendments and technical corrections. Any or all of these could impact the Company unfavorably.On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act, among other things, permits net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks to offset 100% of taxable income for taxable years beginning before 2021. In addition, the CARES Act allows net operating losses incurred in fiscal 2019, 2020, and 2021 to be carried back to each of the five preceding taxable fiscal years to generate a refund of previously paid income taxes. The CARES Act is subject to interpretation and implementation guidance by both federal and state tax authorities, as well as amendments and technical corrections. Any or all of these could impact the Company unfavorably.Many countries are adopting provisions to align their international tax rules with the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, led by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy. These provisions, individually or as a whole, may negatively impact taxation of international business.The tax laws and regulations of the various countries where the Company has operations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although the Company believes that its historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that these tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that the Company would be successful in defending against any such challenge.The Company’s future income tax expense could also be favorably or adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes to its operating structure.14Table of ContentsIf the Company fails to maintain effective internal controls, it may not be able to report its financial results accurately or timely, or prevent or detect fraud, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business or the market price of the Company’s securities.Effective internal controls are necessary for the Company to provide reliable financial reports, safeguard its assets and to effectively prevent or detect fraud. If the Company cannot provide reliable financial reports and effectively safeguard its assets and prevent or detect fraudulent activity, its brand and operating results could be harmed. Internal controls over financial reporting are intended to prevent or detect material misstatements in its financial reporting or material fraudulent activity. Although such controls are inherently limited and may not identify all immaterial activity which could aggregate into a material misstatement, such limitations include the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls cannot provide absolute assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements and prevention of all fraud and loss of assets. Management continuously evaluates the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s internal controls. However, if the Company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved internal controls, or if the Company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the Company’s business and operating results could be harmed. Additionally, the Company may be subject to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities, and the Company could fail to meet its reporting obligations, all of which could have an adverse effect on its business or the market price of the Company’s securities.The Company’s acquisition strategy may not produce the expected benefits, which may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.Avnet has made, and expects to continue to make, strategic acquisitions or investments in companies around the world to further its strategic objectives and support key business initiatives. Acquisitions and investments involve risks and uncertainties, some of which may differ from those associated with Avnet’s historical operations. The risks relating to such acquisitions and investments include, but are not limited to, risks relating to expanding into emerging markets and business areas, adding additional product lines and services, impacting existing customer and supplier relationships, incurring costs or liabilities associated with the companies acquired, incurring potential impairment charges on acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and diverting management’s attention from existing business operations. As a result, the Company’s profitability may be negatively impacted. In addition, the Company may not be successful in integrating the acquired businesses or the integration may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than anticipated. Further, any litigation relating to a potential acquisition will result in an increase in the expenses associated with the acquisition or cause a delay in completing the acquisition, thereby impacting the Company’s profitability. The Company may experience disruptions that could, depending on the size of the acquisition, have an adverse effect on its business, especially where an acquisition target may have pre-existing compliance issues or pre-existing deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting. Furthermore, the Company may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from its acquisitions, which could adversely affect the Company’s financial performance.The Company may become involved in legal proceedings that could cause it to incur substantial costs, divert management’s efforts or require it to pay substantial damages or licensing fees.From time to time, the Company may become involved in legal proceedings, including government investigations, that arise out of the ordinary conduct of the Company’s business, including matters involving intellectual property rights, commercial matters, merger-related matters, product liability and other actions. The Company may be obligated to indemnify and defend its customers if the products or services the Company sells are alleged to infringe any third party’s intellectual property rights. While the Company may be able to seek indemnification from its suppliers for itself and its customers against such claims, there is no assurance that it will be successful in realizing such indemnification or that the Company will be fully protected against such claims. However, the Company is exposed to potential liability for 15technology and products that it develops for which it has no indemnification protections. If an infringement claim against the Company is successful, the Company may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. The Company may have to stop selling certain products or services, which could affect its ability to compete effectively. In addition, the Company’s expanding business activities may include the assembly or manufacture of electronic component products and systems. Product defects, whether caused by a design, assembly, manufacture or component failure or error, or manufacturing processes not in compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements may result in product liability claims, product recalls, fines and penalties. Product liability risks could be particularly significant with respect to aerospace, automotive and medical applications because of the risk of serious harm to users of such products. Legal proceedings could result in substantial costs and diversion of management’s efforts and other resources and could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations and business reputation.In order to be successful, the Company must attract, retain, train, motivate and develop key employees, and failure to do so could adversely impact the Company’s results and strategic initiatives.Identifying, developing internally or hiring externally, training and retaining qualified employees are critical to the Company’s future, and competition for experienced employees in the Company’s industry can be intense. Restrictions on immigration or changes in immigration laws, including related to visa restrictions, may limit the Company’s acquisition of talent in key business areas. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers leave the Company. In addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, and as the Company expands its offerings, realignment, training and hiring of skilled personnel may not be sufficiently rapid. From time to time the Company has effected restructurings, which eliminate a number of positions. Even if such personnel are not directly affected by the restructuring effort, such terminations can have a negative impact on morale and the Company’s ability to attract and hire new qualified personnel in the future. If the Company loses existing qualified personnel or is unable to hire new qualified personnel, as needed, the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed.Failure to comply with the requirements of environmental regulations could adversely affect the Company’s business.The Company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, recycling of products at the end of their useful life and other related matters. While the Company strives to ensure it is in full compliance with all applicable regulations, certain of these regulations impose liability without fault. Additionally, the Company may be held responsible for the prior activities of an entity it acquired. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in substantial costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury. Further, environmental laws may become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations.​"
9,AVT,AVNET INC,2019-08-15,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors
This Report contains forward-looking statements with respect to the financial condition, results of operations and business of Avnet. These statements are generally identified by words like “believes,” “plans,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “should,” “will,” “may,” “estimates” or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Except as required by law, Avnet does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements include those discussed below.The factors discussed below make the Company’s operating results for future periods difficult to predict and, therefore, prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. Any of the below factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, may have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial results, operations, prospects and liquidity. The Company’s operating results have fluctuated in the past and likely will continue to do so. If the Company’s operating results fall below its forecasts and the expectations of public market analysts and investors, the trading price of the Company’s common stock will likely decrease.Economic weakness and geopolitical uncertainty could adversely affect the Company’s results and prospects.The Company’s financial results, operations and prospects depend significantly on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions, the demand for its products and services, and the financial condition of its customers and suppliers. Economic weakness and geopolitical uncertainty, including the uncertainty caused by the United Kingdom’s planned exit from the European Union commonly referred to as “Brexit,” have in the past resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased sales, margins and earnings. Economic weakness and geopolitical uncertainty may also lead the Company to impair assets, including goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets, take restructuring actions and reduce expenses in response to decreased sales or margins. The Company may not be able to adequately adjust its cost structure in a timely fashion, which may adversely impact its profitability. Uncertainty about economic conditions may increase foreign currency volatility in markets in which the Company transacts business, which may negatively impact the Company’s results. Economic weakness and geopolitical uncertainty also make it more difficult for the Company to manage inventory levels and/or collect customer receivables, which may result in provisions to create reserves, write-offs, reduced access to liquidity and higher financing costs. The Company is monitoring the Brexit negotiations and developing contingency plans, including changes to its logistics operations and shipment routes and preparing for changes in trade facilitation regulations. While the specific terms and impact of Brexit are not yet known, Brexit may adversely impact the United Kingdom and/or the European Union and therefore may have an adverse effect on the Company’s trade operations and financial results.The Company experiences significant competitive pressure, which may negatively impact its results.The market for the Company’s products and services is very competitive and subject to rapid technological advances, new market entrants, non-traditional competitors, changes in industry standards and changes in customer needs and  7Table of Contentsconsumption models. Not only does the Company compete with other global distributors, it also competes for customers with regional distributors and some of the Company’s own suppliers that maintain direct sales efforts. In addition, as the Company expands its offerings and geographies, the Company may encounter increased competition from current or new competitors. The Company’s failure to maintain and enhance its competitive position could adversely affect its business and prospects. Furthermore, the Company’s efforts to compete in the marketplace could cause deterioration of gross profit margins and, thus, overall profitability.The size of the Company’s competitors vary across market sectors, as do the resources the Company has allocated to the sectors and geographic areas in which it does business. Therefore, some competitors may have greater resources or a more extensive customer or supplier base than the Company has in one or more of its market sectors and geographic areas, which may result in the Company not being able to effectively compete in certain markets which could impact the Company’s profitability and prospects.Changes in customer needs and consumption models could significantly affect the Company’s operating results.Changes in customer needs and consumption models may cause a decline in the Company’s billings, which would have a negative impact on the Company’s financial results. While the Company attempts to identify changes in market conditions as soon as possible, the dynamics of these industries make prediction of, and timely reaction to such changes difficult. Future downturns in the semiconductor and embedded solutions industries could adversely affect the Company’s operating results and negatively impact the Company’s ability to maintain its current profitability levels. In addition, the semiconductor industry has historically experienced periodic fluctuations in product supply and demand, often associated with changes in economic conditions, technology and manufacturing capacity. During fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, sales of semiconductors represented approximately 77%, 78%, and 78% of the Company's consolidated sales, respectively, and the Company’s sales closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor industry. Due to the Company’s increased online sales, system interruptions and delays that make its websites and services unavailable or slow to respond may reduce the attractiveness of its products and services to its customers. If the Company is unable to continually improve the efficiency of its systems, it could cause systems interruptions or delays and adversely affect the Company’s operating results.Failure to maintain or develop new relationships with key suppliers could adversely affect the Company’s sales.One of the Company’s competitive strengths is the breadth and quality of the suppliers whose products the Company distributes. However, billings of products and services from one of the Company’s suppliers, Texas Instruments (“TI”), accounted for approximately 10% of the Company’s consolidated billings in fiscal 2019. Management expects TI’s products and services to continue to account for roughly a similar percentage of the Company’s consolidated billings in fiscal 2020. The Company’s contracts with its suppliers vary in duration and are generally terminable by either party at will upon notice. To the extent any primary suppliers terminate or significantly reduce their volume of business with the Company in the future, because of a product shortage, an unwillingness to do business with the Company, changes in strategy or otherwise, the Company’s business and relationships with its customers could be negatively affected because its customers depend on the Company’s distribution of technology hardware and software from the industry’s leading suppliers. In addition, suppliers’ strategy shifts or performance issues may negatively affect the Company’s financial results. The competitive landscape has also experienced a consolidation among suppliers, which could negatively impact the Company’s profitability and customer base. Further, to the extent that any of the Company’s key suppliers modify the terms of their contracts including, without limitation, the terms regarding price protection, rights of return, rebates or other terms that protect or enhance the Company’s gross margins, it could negatively affect the Company’s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 8Table of ContentsThe Company’s non-U.S. locations represent a significant portion of its sales and, consequently, the Company is exposed to risks associated with operating internationally that could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.During fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 approximately 75%, 76% and 72%, respectively, of the Company’s sales came from its operations outside the United States. As a result of the Company’s international operations, in particular those in emerging and developing economies, the Company’s operations are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including, but not limited to, the following: ·potential restrictions on the Company’s ability to repatriate funds from its foreign subsidiaries; ·foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations and the impact on the Company’s results of operations; ·compliance with foreign and domestic import and export regulations, data privacy regulations, business licensing requirements, environmental regulations and anti-corruption laws, the failure of which could result in severe penalties including monetary fines, criminal proceedings and suspension of import or export privileges; ·adoption or expansion of trade restrictions, including technology transfer restrictions, specific company sanctions, new and higher duties, tariffs or surcharges, or other import/export controls, unilaterally or bilaterally; ·complex and changing tax laws and regulations;  ·regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ between jurisdictions;  ·economic and political instability (including the uncertainty caused by Brexit), terrorism and potential military conflicts or civilian unrest; ·fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure; ·natural disasters and health concerns;  ·differing environmental regulations and employment practices and labor issues; and ·the risk of non-compliance with local laws.In addition to the cost of compliance, the potential criminal penalties for violations of import or export regulations and anti-corruption laws by the Company or its third-party agents create heightened risks for the Company’s international operations. In the event that a governing regulatory body determines that the Company has violated applicable import or export regulations or anti-corruption laws, the Company could be fined significant sums, incur sizable legal defense costs and/or its import or export capabilities could be restricted, which could have a material and adverse effect on the Company’s business. Additionally, allegations that the Company has violated a governmental regulation may negatively impact the Company’s reputation, which may result in customers or suppliers being unwilling to do business with the Company. While the Company has adopted measures and controls designed to ensure compliance with these laws, the Company cannot be assured that such measures will be adequate or that its business will not be materially and adversely impacted in the event of an alleged violation.The Company transacts sales, pays expenses, owns assets and incurs liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Because the Company’s consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars, the Company must translate sales, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect during each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and other currencies affect the Company’s reported amounts of sales, operating income, assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, unexpected and dramatic changes in foreign currency exchange rates may negatively affect the Company’s earnings from those markets. While the Company may use derivative financial instruments to further reduce  9Table of Contentsits net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will not materially affect the Company’s financial results. Further, foreign currency instability and disruptions in the credit and capital markets may increase credit risks for some of the Company’s customers and may impair its customers’ ability to repay existing obligations.Recently, the U.S. government imposed new or higher tariffs on certain products imported into the U.S., and the Chinese government imposed new or higher tariffs on certain products imported into China, which have increased the costs of procuring certain products the Company purchases from its suppliers. The higher tariffs, along with any additional tariffs or trade restrictions that may be implemented by the U.S. or by other countries on U.S. goods in the future, may  result in further increased costs and other related expenses. While the Company intends to reflect such increased costs in its selling prices, such price increases may impact the Company’s sales and customer demand for certain products. In addition, increased operational expenses incurred in minimizing the number of products subject to the tariffs could adversely affect the operating profits for certain of its business units. Neither such U.S. tariffs nor any retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods have yet had a significant impact, but there can be no assurance that future actions or escalations that affect trade relations will not occur or will not materially affect the Company’s sales and results of operations. To the extent that Company sales or profitability are negatively affected by any such tariffs or other trade actions, the Company’s business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.If the Company’s internal information systems fail to function properly, or if the Company is unsuccessful in the implementation, integration or upgrade of information systems, its business operations could suffer.The Company is dependent on its information systems to facilitate the day-to-day operations of the business and to produce timely, accurate and reliable information on financial and operational results. Currently, the Company’s global operations are tracked with multiple information systems, some of which are subject to ongoing IT projects designed to streamline or optimize the Company’s global information systems. These IT projects are extremely complex, in part, because of a wide range of processes, the multiple legacy systems used and the Company’s business operations. There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful at all times in these efforts or that there will not be implementation or integration difficulties that will adversely affect the Company’s ability to complete business transactions and ensure accurate recording and reporting of financial data. In addition, the Company may be unable to achieve the expected efficiencies and cost savings as a result of the IT projects, thus negatively impacting the Company’s financial results. A failure of any of these information systems in a way described above or material difficulties in upgrading these information systems could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, internal controls and reporting obligations under federal securities laws.The Company’s acquisition strategy may not produce the expected benefits, which may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.Avnet has made, and expects to continue to make, strategic acquisitions or investments in companies around the world to further its strategic objectives and support key business initiatives. Acquisitions and investments involve risks and uncertainties, some of which may differ from those associated with Avnet’s historical operations. The risks relating to such acquisitions and investments include, but are not limited to, risks relating to expanding into emerging markets and business areas, adding additional product lines and services, impacting existing customer and supplier relationships, incurring costs or liabilities associated with the companies acquired, incurring potential impairment charges on acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and diverting management’s attention from existing business operations. As a result, the Company’s profitability may be negatively impacted. In addition, the Company may not be successful in integrating the acquired businesses or the integration may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than anticipated. Further, any litigation relating to a potential acquisition will result in an increase in the expenses associated with the acquisition or cause a delay in completing the acquisition, thereby impacting the Company’s profitability. The Company may experience disruptions that could, depending on the size of the acquisition, have an adverse effect on its business, especially where an  10Table of Contentsacquisition target may have pre-existing compliance issues or pre-existing deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting. Furthermore, the Company may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from its acquisitions, which could adversely affect the Company’s financial performance.Major disruptions to the Company’s logistics capability could have an adverse impact on the Company’s operations.The Company’s global logistics services are operated through specialized, centralized or outsourced distribution centers around the globe. The Company also depends almost entirely on third-party transportation service providers for the delivery of products to its customers. A major interruption or disruption in service at one or more of its distribution centers for any reason (such as information technology upgrades and operating issues, warehouse modernization and relocation efforts, natural disasters, pandemics, or significant disruptions of services from the Company’s third-party transportation providers) could cause cancellations or delays in a significant number of shipments to customers and, as a result, could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business partners, and on the Company’s business, operations and financial performance.If the Company sustains cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches, it could suffer a loss of sales and increased costs, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm and other negative consequences.The Company’s information technology may be subject to cyber-attacks, security breaches or computer hacking. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate the Company’s security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal, proprietary or confidential information, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. They also may be able to develop and deploy malicious software programs that attack the Company’s systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. The Company’s systems and the data stored on those systems may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks, acts of vandalism or theft, coordinated attacks by activist entities, misplaced or lost data, human errors, or other similar events that could negatively affect the Company’s systems and its data, as well as the data of the Company’s business partners. Further, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or suppliers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the Company’s data and information technology systems, otherwise known as phishing. Lastly, third parties, such as hosted solution providers, that provide services to the Company, could also be a source of security risk in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure.The costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be significant. The Company’s remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential suppliers or customers. In addition, breaches of the Company’s security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal, proprietary or confidential information about the Company, its business partners or other third parties could expose the Company to significant potential liability and reputational harm. As threats related to cyber-attacks develop and grow, the Company may also find it necessary to make further investments to protect its data and infrastructure, which may impact the Company’s profitability. Although the Company has insurance coverage for protecting against cyber-attacks, it may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims, and the Company may suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on its business. As a global enterprise, the Company could also be negatively impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, data privacy, data localization and data protection.Declines in the value of the Company’s inventory or unexpected order cancellations by the Company’s customers could adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.The electronic components and integrated products industries are subject to rapid technological change, new and  11Table of Contentsenhanced products, changes in customer needs and changes in industry standards and regulatory requirements, which can contribute to a decline in value or obsolescence of inventory. Regardless of the general economic environment, it is possible that prices will decline due to a decrease in demand or an oversupply of products and, as a result of the price declines, there may be greater risk of declines in inventory value. Although it is the policy of many of the Company’s suppliers to offer certain protections from the loss in value of inventory (such as price protection and limited rights of return), the Company cannot be assured that such policies will fully compensate for the loss in value, or that the suppliers will choose to, or be able to, honor such agreements, some of which are not documented and, therefore, subject to the discretion of the supplier. In addition, the majority of the Company’s sales are made pursuant to individual purchase orders, rather than through long-term sales contracts. Where there is a contract, such contract is generally terminable at will upon notice. The Company cannot be assured that unforeseen new product developments, declines in the value of the Company’s inventory or unforeseen order cancellations by its customers will not adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.Substantial defaults by the Company’s customers or suppliers on its accounts receivable or the loss of significant customers could have a significant negative impact on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.A significant portion of the Company’s working capital consists of accounts receivable. If entities responsible for a significant amount of accounts receivable were to cease doing business, direct their business elsewhere, become insolvent or unable to pay the amount they owe the Company, or were to become unwilling or unable to make such payments in a timely manner, the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected. An economic or industry downturn could adversely affect the collectability of these accounts receivable, which could result in longer payment cycles, increased collection costs and defaults in excess of management’s expectations. A significant deterioration in the Company’s ability to collect on accounts receivable in the United States could also impact the cost or availability of financing under its accounts receivable securitization program.The Company may not have adequate or cost-effective liquidity or capital resources which could adversely affect the Company’s operations.The Company’s ability to satisfy its cash needs and implement its capital allocation strategy depends on its ability to generate cash from operations and to access the financial markets, both of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond the Company’s control.The Company may need to satisfy its cash needs through external financing. However, external financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. As of June 29, 2019, Avnet had total debt outstanding of approximately $1.72 billion under various notes, secured borrowings and committed and uncommitted lines of credit with financial institutions. The Company needs cash to make interest payments on, and to repay, this indebtedness and for general corporate purposes, such as funding its ongoing working capital and capital expenditure needs. Under the terms of any external financing, the Company may incur higher than expected financing expenses and become subject to additional restrictions and covenants. Any material increase in the Company’s financing costs could have an adverse effect on its profitability. Under certain of its credit facilities, the Company is required to maintain certain specified financial ratios and pass certain financial tests. If the Company fails to meet these financial ratios and/or pass these tests, it may be unable to continue to utilize these facilities. If the Company is unable to utilize these facilities, it may not have sufficient cash available to make interest payments, to repay indebtedness or for general corporate needs. General economic or business conditions, domestic and foreign, may be less favorable than management expects and could adversely impact the Company’s sales or its ability to collect receivables from its customers, which may impact access to the Company’s accounts receivable securitization program. 12Table of ContentsIn order to be successful, the Company must attract, retain, train, motivate and develop key employees, and failure to do so could adversely impact the Company’s results and strategic initiatives.Identifying, developing internally or hiring externally, training and retaining qualified employees are critical to the Company’s future, and competition for experienced employees in the Company’s industry can be intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers leave the Company. In addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, and as the Company expands its offerings, realignment, training and hiring of skilled personnel may not be sufficiently rapid. From time to time the Company has effected restructurings, which eliminate a number of positions. Even if such personnel are not directly affected by the restructuring effort, such terminations can have a negative impact on morale and the Company’s ability to attract and hire new qualified personnel in the future. If the Company loses existing qualified personnel or is unable to hire new qualified personnel, as needed, the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed.The agreements governing some of the Company’s financings contain various covenants and restrictions that limit management’s discretion in operating the business and could prevent management from engaging in some activities that may be beneficial to the Company’s business.The agreements governing the Company’s financing, including its credit facility, accounts receivable securitization program and the indentures governing the Company’s outstanding notes, contain various covenants and restrictions that, in certain circumstances, limit the Company’s ability, and the ability of certain subsidiaries, to: ·grant liens on assets; ·make restricted payments (including, under certain circumstances, paying dividends on common stock or redeeming or repurchasing common stock); ·make certain investments; ·merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of the Company’s assets; ·incur additional debt; or ·engage in certain transactions with affiliates.As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the Company may be limited in the future in how it conducts its business and may be unable to raise additional debt, repurchase common stock, pay a dividend, compete effectively or make further investments.The Company may become involved in legal proceedings that could cause it to incur substantial costs, divert management’s efforts or require it to pay substantial damages or licensing fees. From time to time, the Company may become involved in legal proceedings, including government investigations, that arise out of the ordinary conduct of the Company’s business, including matters involving intellectual property rights, commercial matters, merger-related matters, product liability and other actions. The Company may be obligated to indemnify and defend its customers if the products or services the Company sells are alleged to infringe any third party’s intellectual property rights. While the Company may be able to seek indemnification from its suppliers for itself and its customers against such claims, there is no assurance that it will be successful in realizing such indemnification or that the Company will be fully protected against such claims. However, the Company is exposed to potential liability for technology and products that it develops for which it has no indemnification protections. If an infringement claim against the Company is successful, the Company may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. The Company may have to stop selling certain products or  13Table of Contentsservices, which could affect its ability to compete effectively. In addition, the Company’s expanding business activities may include the assembly or manufacture of electronic component products and systems. Product defects, whether caused by a design, assembly, manufacture or component failure or error, or manufacturing processes not in compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements may result in product liability claims, product recalls, fines and penalties. Product liability risks could be particularly significant with respect to aerospace, automotive and medical applications because of the risk of serious harm to users of such products. Legal proceedings could result in substantial costs and diversion of management’s efforts and other resources and could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations and business reputation.Changes in tax rules and regulations, changes in interpretation of tax rules and regulations, changes in business performance or unfavorable assessments from tax audits could adversely affect the Company’s effective tax rates, deferred taxes, financial condition and results of operations.As a multinational corporation, the Company is subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States and many foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, regulations may be enacted that could adversely affect the Company’s tax positions. There can be no assurance that the Company’s cash flow, and in some cases the effective tax rate, will not be adversely affected by these potential changes in regulations or by changes in the interpretation of existing tax law and regulations. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted tax legislation (the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” or the “Act”) which includes provisions to lower the corporate income tax rate, impose new taxes on certain foreign earnings, limit deductibility of certain U.S. costs and levy a one-time deemed repatriation tax on accumulated offshore earnings, among others. The Act is subject to interpretation and implementation guidance by both federal and state tax authorities, as well as amendments and technical corrections. Any or all of these could impact the Company unfavorably.  Many countries are adopting provisions to align their international tax rules with the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, led by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy. These provisions, individually or as a whole, may negatively impact taxation of international business.The tax laws and regulations of the various countries where the Company has operations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although the Company believes that its historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that these tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that the Company would be successful in defending against any such challenge.The Company’s future income tax expense could also be favorably or adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes to its operating structure.If the Company fails to maintain effective internal controls, it may not be able to report its financial results accurately or timely, or prevent or detect fraud, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business or the market price of the Company’s securities.Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for the Company to provide reliable financial reports and to effectively prevent or detect fraud. If the Company cannot provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent or detect fraud, its brand and operating results could be harmed. Internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because such controls are inherently limited; such limitations include the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls cannot provide absolute assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, if not properly maintained and updated, internal controls over financial reporting may become inadequate. If the Company fails  14Table of Contentsto maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved internal controls, or if the Company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the Company’s business and operating results could be harmed. Additionally, the Company may be subject to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities, and the Company could fail to meet its reporting obligations, all of which could have an adverse effect on its business or the market price of the Company’s securities.Failure to comply with the requirements of environmental regulations could adversely affect the Company’s business.The Company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, recycling of products at the end of their useful life and other related matters. While the Company strives to ensure it is in full compliance with all applicable regulations, certain of these regulations impose liability without fault. Additionally, the Company may be held responsible for the prior activities of an entity it acquired. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in substantial costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury. Further, environmental laws may become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations. "

Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors
This Report contains forward-looking statements with respect to the financial condition, results of operations and business of Avnet. These statements are generally identified by words like “believes,” “plans,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “should,” “will,” “may,” “estimates” or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Except as required by law, Avnet does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements include those discussed below.The factors discussed below make the Company’s operating results for future periods difficult to predict and, therefore, prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. Any of the below factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, may have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial results, operations, prospects and liquidity. The Company’s operating results have fluctuated in the past and likely will continue to do so. If the Company’s operating results fall below its forecasts and the expectations of public market analysts and investors, the trading price of the Company’s common stock will likely decrease.Economic weakness and geopolitical uncertainty could adversely affect the Company’s results and prospects.The Company’s financial results, operations and prospects depend significantly on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions, the demand for its products and services, and the financial condition of its customers and suppliers. Economic weakness and geopolitical uncertainty have in the past resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased sales, margins and earnings. Economic weakness and geopolitical uncertainty may also lead the Company to impair assets, including goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets, take restructuring actions and reduce expenses in response  7 Table of Contentsto decreased sales or margins. The Company may not be able to adequately adjust its cost structure in a timely fashion, which may adversely impact its profitability. Uncertainty about economic conditions may increase foreign currency volatility in markets in which the Company transacts business, which may negatively impact the Company’s results. Economic weakness and geopolitical uncertainty also make it more difficult for the Company to manage inventory levels and/or collect customer receivables, which may result in provisions to create reserves, write-offs, reduced access to liquidity and higher financing costs.The Company experiences significant competitive pressure, which may negatively impact its results.The market for the Company’s products and services is very competitive and subject to rapid technological advances, new market entrants, non-traditional competitors, changes in industry standards and changes in customer needs and consumption models. Not only does the Company compete with other global distributors, it also competes for customers with regional distributors and some of the Company’s own suppliers that maintain direct sales efforts. In addition, as the Company expands its offerings and geographies, the Company may encounter increased competition from current or new competitors. The Company’s failure to maintain and enhance its competitive position could adversely affect its business and prospects. Furthermore, the Company’s efforts to compete in the marketplace could cause deterioration of gross profit margins and, thus, overall profitability.The size of the Company’s competitors vary across market sectors, as do the resources the Company has allocated to the sectors and geographic areas in which it does business. Therefore, some competitors may have greater resources or a more extensive customer or supplier base than the Company has in one or more of its market sectors and geographic areas, which may result in the Company not being able to effectively compete in certain markets which could impact the Company’s profitability and prospects.Changes in customer needs and consumption models could significantly affect the Company’s operating results.Changes in customer needs and consumption models may cause a decline in the Company’s billings, which would have a negative impact on the Company’s financial results. While the Company attempts to identify changes in market conditions as soon as possible, the dynamics of these industries make prediction of, and timely reaction to such changes difficult. Future downturns in the semiconductor and embedded solutions industries could adversely affect the Company’s operating results and negatively impact the Company’s ability to maintain its current profitability levels. In addition, the semiconductor industry has historically experienced periodic fluctuations in product supply and demand, often associated with changes in economic conditions, technology and manufacturing capacity. During fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, sales of semiconductors represented approximately 78%, 78%, and 83% of the Company's consolidated sales, respectively, and the Company’s sales closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor industry. Due to the Company’s increased online sales, system interruptions and delays that make its websites and services unavailable or slow to respond may reduce the attractiveness of its products and services to its customers. If the Company is unable to continually improve the efficiency of its systems, it could cause systems interruptions or delays and adversely affect the Company’s operating results.Failure to maintain or develop new relationships with key suppliers could adversely affect the Company’s sales.One of the Company’s competitive strengths is the breadth and quality of the suppliers whose products the Company distributes. However, billings of products and services from one of the Company’s suppliers, Texas Instruments (“TI”), accounted for approximately 11% of the Company’s consolidated billings in fiscal 2018. Management expects TI’s products and services to continue to account for roughly a similar percentage of the Company’s consolidated billings in fiscal 2019. The Company’s contracts with its suppliers vary in duration and are generally terminable by either party at will upon notice. To the extent any primary suppliers terminate or significantly reduce their volume of business with the  8 Table of ContentsCompany in the future, because of a product shortage, an unwillingness to do business with the Company, changes in strategy or otherwise, the Company’s business and relationships with its customers could be negatively affected because its customers depend on the Company’s distribution of technology hardware and software from the industry’s leading suppliers. In addition, suppliers’ strategy shifts or performance issues may negatively affect the Company’s financial results. The competitive landscape has also experienced a consolidation among suppliers, which could negatively impact the Company’s profitability and customer base. Further, to the extent that any of the Company’s key suppliers modify the terms of their contracts including, without limitation, the terms regarding price protection, rights of return, rebates or other terms that protect or enhance the Company’s gross margins, it could negatively affect the Company’s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.The Company’s non-U.S. locations represent a significant portion of its sales and, consequently, the Company is exposed to risks associated with operating internationally that could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.During fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 approximately 76%, 72% and 73%, respectively, of the Company’s sales came from its operations outside the United States. As a result of the Company’s international operations, in particular those in emerging and developing economies, the Company’s operations are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including, but not limited to, the following: ·potential restrictions on the Company’s ability to repatriate funds from its foreign subsidiaries; ·foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations and the impact on the Company’s results of operations; ·compliance with foreign and domestic import and export regulations, data privacy regulations, business licensing requirements, environmental regulations and anti-corruption laws, the failure of which could result in severe penalties including monetary fines, criminal proceedings and suspension of import or export privileges; ·adoption or expansion of trade restrictions, including new and higher duties, tariffs, surcharges, or other import/export controls, unilaterally or bilaterally; ·complex and changing tax laws and regulations;  ·regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ between jurisdictions;  ·economic and political instability (including the uncertainty caused by the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union), terrorism and potential military conflicts or civilian unrest; ·fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure; ·natural disasters and health concerns;  ·differing environmental regulations and employment practices and labor issues; and ·the risk of non-compliance with local laws.In addition to the cost of compliance, the potential criminal penalties for violations of import or export regulations and anti-corruption laws by the Company or its third-party agents create heightened risks for the Company’s international operations. In the event that a governing regulatory body determines that the Company has violated applicable import or export regulations or anti-corruption laws, the Company could be fined significant sums, incur sizable legal defense costs and/or its import or export capabilities could be restricted, which could have a material and adverse effect on the Company’s business. Additionally, allegations that the Company has violated a governmental regulation may negatively impact the Company’s reputation, which may result in customers or suppliers being unwilling to do business with the Company. While  9 Table of Contentsthe Company has adopted measures and controls designed to ensure compliance with these laws, the Company cannot be assured that such measures will be adequate or that its business will not be materially and adversely impacted in the event of an alleged violation.The Company transacts sales, pays expenses, owns assets and incurs liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Because the Company’s consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars, the Company must translate sales, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect during each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and other currencies affect the Company’s reported amounts of sales, operating income, assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, unexpected and dramatic changes in foreign currency exchange rates may negatively affect the Company’s earnings from those markets. While the Company may use derivative financial instruments to further reduce its net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will not materially affect the Company’s financial results. Further, foreign currency instability and disruptions in the credit and capital markets may increase credit risks for some of the Company’s customers and may impair its customers’ ability to repay existing obligations.Recently, the U.S. government imposed new or higher tariffs on certain products imported into the U.S., which have increased the costs of procuring certain products the Company purchases from its suppliers. The higher tariffs, along with any additional tariffs or trade restrictions that may be implemented by the U.S. or by other countries on U.S. goods in the future, may  result in further increased costs and other related expenses. While the Company intends to reflect such increased costs in its selling prices, such price increases may impact the Company’s sales and customer demand for certain products. In addition, increased operational expenses incurred in minimizing the number of products subject to the tariffs could adversely affect the operating profits for certain of its business units. Neither such U.S. tariffs nor any retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods have yet had a significant impact, but there can be no assurance that future actions or escalations that affect trade relations will not occur or will not materially affect the Company’s sales and results of operations. To the extent that Company sales or profitability are negatively affected by any such tariffs or other trade actions, the Company’s business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.If the Company’s internal information systems fail to function properly, or if the Company is unsuccessful in the implementation, integration or upgrade of information systems, its business operations could suffer.The Company is dependent on its information systems to facilitate the day-to-day operations of the business and to produce timely, accurate and reliable information on financial and operational results. Currently, the Company’s global operations are tracked with multiple information systems, some of which are subject to ongoing IT projects designed to streamline or optimize the Company’s global information systems. These IT projects are extremely complex, in part, because of a wide range of processes, the multiple legacy systems used and the Company’s business operations. There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful at all times in these efforts or that there will not be implementation or integration difficulties that will adversely affect the Company’s ability to complete business transactions and ensure accurate recording and reporting of financial data. In addition, the Company may be unable to achieve the expected efficiencies and cost savings as a result of the IT projects, thus negatively impacting the Company’s financial results. A failure of any of these information systems in a way described above or material difficulties in upgrading these information systems could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, internal controls and reporting obligations under federal securities laws.The Company’s acquisition strategy may not produce the expected benefits, which may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.Avnet has made, and expects to continue to make, strategic acquisitions or investments in companies around the world to further its strategic objectives and support key business initiatives. Acquisitions and investments involve risks  10 Table of Contentsand uncertainties, some of which may differ from those associated with Avnet’s historical operations. The risks relating to such acquisitions and investments include, but are not limited to, risks relating to expanding into emerging markets and business areas, adding additional product lines and services, impacting existing customer and supplier relationships, incurring costs or liabilities associated with the companies acquired, incurring potential impairment charges on acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and diverting management’s attention from existing business operations. As a result, the Company’s profitability may be negatively impacted. In addition, the Company may not be successful in integrating the acquired businesses or the integration may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than anticipated. Further, any litigation relating to a potential acquisition will result in an increase in the expenses associated with the acquisition or cause a delay in completing the acquisition, thereby impacting the Company’s profitability. The Company may experience disruptions that could, depending on the size of the acquisition, have an adverse effect on its business, especially where an acquisition target may have pre-existing compliance issues or pre-existing deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting. Furthermore, the Company may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from its acquisitions, which could adversely affect the Company’s financial performance.Major disruptions to the Company’s logistics capability could have an adverse impact on the Company’s operations.The Company’s global logistics services are operated through specialized, centralized or outsourced distribution centers around the globe. The Company also depends almost entirely on third-party transportation service providers for the delivery of products to its customers. A major interruption or disruption in service at one or more of its distribution centers for any reason (such as information technology upgrades and operating issues, warehouse modernization and relocation efforts, natural disasters, pandemics, or significant disruptions of services from the Company’s third-party transportation providers) could cause cancellations or delays in a significant number of shipments to customers and, as a result, could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business partners, and on the Company’s business, operations and financial performance.If the Company sustains cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches, it could suffer a loss of sales and increased costs, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm and other negative consequences.The Company’s information technology may be subject to cyber-attacks, security breaches or computer hacking. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate the Company’s security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal, proprietary or confidential information, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. They also may be able to develop and deploy malicious software programs that attack the Company’s systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. The Company’s systems and the data stored on those systems may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks, acts of vandalism or theft, coordinated attacks by activist entities, misplaced or lost data, human errors, or other similar events that could negatively affect the Company’s systems and its data, as well as the data of the Company’s business partners. Further, third parties, such as hosted solution providers, that provide services to the Company, could also be a source of security risk in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure.The costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be significant. The Company’s remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential suppliers or customers. In addition, breaches of the Company’s security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal, proprietary or confidential information about the Company, its business partners or other third parties could expose the Company to significant potential liability and reputational harm. As threats related to cyber-attacks develop and grow, the Company may also find it necessary to make further investments to protect its data and infrastructure, which may impact the Company’s profitability. Although the Company has insurance coverage for protecting against cyber-attacks, it may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims,  11 Table of Contentsand the Company may suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on its business. As a global enterprise, the Company could also be negatively impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, data privacy, data localization and data protection.Declines in the value of the Company’s inventory or unexpected order cancellations by the Company’s customers could adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.The electronic components and integrated products industries are subject to rapid technological change, new and enhanced products, changes in customer needs and changes in industry standards and regulatory requirements, which can contribute to a decline in value or obsolescence of inventory. Regardless of the general economic environment, it is possible that prices will decline due to a decrease in demand or an oversupply of products and, as a result of the price declines, there may be greater risk of declines in inventory value. Although it is the policy of many of the Company’s suppliers to offer certain protections from the loss in value of inventory (such as price protection and limited rights of return), the Company cannot be assured that such policies will fully compensate for the loss in value, or that the suppliers will choose to, or be able to, honor such agreements, some of which are not documented and, therefore, subject to the discretion of the supplier. In addition, the majority of the Company’s sales are made pursuant to individual purchase orders, rather than through long-term sales contracts. Where there is a contract, such contract is generally terminable at will upon notice. The Company cannot be assured that unforeseen new product developments, declines in the value of the Company’s inventory or unforeseen order cancellations by its customers will not adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.Substantial defaults by the Company’s customers or suppliers on its accounts receivable or the loss of significant customers could have a significant negative impact on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.A significant portion of the Company’s working capital consists of accounts receivable. If entities responsible for a significant amount of accounts receivable were to cease doing business, direct their business elsewhere, become insolvent or unable to pay the amount they owe the Company, or were to become unwilling or unable to make such payments in a timely manner, the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected. An economic or industry downturn could adversely affect the collectability of these accounts receivable, which could result in longer payment cycles, increased collection costs and defaults in excess of management’s expectations. A significant deterioration in the Company’s ability to collect on accounts receivable in the United States could also impact the cost or availability of financing under its accounts receivable securitization program.The Company may not have adequate or cost-effective liquidity or capital resources which could adversely affect the Company’s operations.The Company’s ability to satisfy its cash needs and implement its capital allocation strategy depends on its ability to generate cash from operations and to access the financial markets, both of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond the Company’s control.The Company may need to satisfy its cash needs through external financing. However, external financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. As of June 30, 2018, Avnet had total debt outstanding of approximately $1.65 billion under various notes, secured borrowings and committed and uncommitted lines of credit with financial institutions. The Company needs cash to make interest payments on, and to repay, this indebtedness and for general corporate purposes, such as funding its ongoing working capital and capital expenditure needs. Under the terms of any external financing, the Company may incur higher than expected financing expenses and become subject to additional restrictions and covenants. Any material increase in the Company’s financing costs could have an adverse effect on its profitability.  12 Table of ContentsUnder certain of its credit facilities, the Company is required to maintain certain specified financial ratios and pass certain financial tests. If the Company fails to meet these financial ratios and/or pass these tests, it may be unable to continue to utilize these facilities. If the Company is unable to utilize these facilities, it may not have sufficient cash available to make interest payments, to repay indebtedness or for general corporate needs. General economic or business conditions, domestic and foreign, may be less favorable than management expects and could adversely impact the Company’s sales or its ability to collect receivables from its customers, which may impact access to the Company’s accounts receivable securitization program.In order to be successful, the Company must attract, retain, train, motivate and develop key employees, and failure to do so could adversely impact the Company’s results and strategic initiatives.Identifying, developing internally or hiring externally, training and retaining qualified employees are critical to the Company’s future, and competition for experienced employees in the Company’s industry can be intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers leave the Company. In addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, and as the Company expands its offerings, realignment, training and hiring of skilled personnel may not be sufficiently rapid. From time to time the Company has effected restructurings, which eliminate a number of positions. Even if such personnel are not directly affected by the restructuring effort, such terminations can have a negative impact on morale and the Company’s ability to attract and hire new qualified personnel in the future. If the Company loses existing qualified personnel or is unable to hire new qualified personnel, as needed, the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed.The agreements governing some of the Company’s financings contain various covenants and restrictions that limit management’s discretion in operating the business and could prevent management from engaging in some activities that may be beneficial to the Company’s business.The agreements governing the Company’s financing, including its credit facility, accounts receivable securitization program and the indentures governing the Company’s outstanding notes, contain various covenants and restrictions that, in certain circumstances, limit the Company’s ability, and the ability of certain subsidiaries, to: ·grant liens on assets; ·make restricted payments (including, under certain circumstances, paying dividends on common stock or redeeming or repurchasing common stock); ·make certain investments; ·merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of the Company’s assets; ·incur additional debt; or ·engage in certain transactions with affiliates.As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the Company may be limited in the future in how it conducts its business and may be unable to raise additional debt, repurchase common stock, pay a dividend, compete effectively or make further investments.The Company may become involved in legal proceedings that could cause it to incur substantial costs, divert management’s efforts or require it to pay substantial damages or licensing fees. From time to time, the Company may become involved in legal proceedings, including government investigations, that arise out of the ordinary conduct of the Company’s business, including matters involving intellectual property rights, commercial matters, merger-related matters and other actions. Legal proceedings could result in substantial costs and  13 Table of Contentsdiversion of management’s efforts and other resources and could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations. Further, the Company may be obligated to indemnify and defend its customers if the products or services the Company sells are alleged to infringe any third party’s intellectual property rights. While the Company may be able to seek indemnification from its suppliers for itself and its customers against such claims, there is no assurance that it will be successful in realizing such indemnification or that the Company will be fully protected against such claims. In addition, the Company is exposed to potential liability for technology that it develops for which it has no indemnification protections. If an infringement claim against the Company is successful, the Company may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. The Company may have to stop selling certain products or services, which could affect its ability to compete effectively.Changes in tax rules and regulations, changes in interpretation of tax rules and regulations, changes in business performance or unfavorable assessments from tax audits could adversely affect the Company’s effective tax rates, deferred taxes, financial condition and results of operations.As a multinational corporation, the Company is subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States and many foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, regulations may be enacted that could adversely affect the Company’s tax positions. There can be no assurance that the Company’s cash flow, and in some cases the effective tax rate, will not be adversely affected by these potential changes in regulations or by changes in the interpretation of existing tax law and regulations. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted tax legislation (the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” or the “Act”) which includes provisions to lower the corporate income tax rate, impose new taxes on certain foreign earnings, limit deductibility of certain U.S. costs and levy a one-time deemed repatriation tax on accumulated offshore earnings, among others. The Act is subject to interpretation and implementation guidance by both federal and state tax authorities, as well as amendments and technical corrections. Any or all of these could impact the Company unfavorably.  Many countries are adopting provisions to align their international tax rules with the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, led by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy. These provisions, individually or as a whole, may negatively impact taxation of international business.The tax laws and regulations of the various countries where the Company has operations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although the Company believes that its historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that these tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that the Company would be successful in defending against any such challenge.The Company’s future income tax expense could also be favorably or adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes to its operating structure.If the Company fails to maintain effective internal controls, it may not be able to report its financial results accurately or timely, or prevent or detect fraud, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business or the market price of the Company’s securities.Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for the Company to provide reliable financial reports and to effectively prevent or detect fraud. If the Company cannot provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent or detect fraud, its brand and operating results could be harmed. Internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because such controls are inherently limited; such limitations include the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls cannot provide absolute assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, if not properly maintained and updated, internal controls over financial reporting may become inadequate. If the Company fails  14 Table of Contentsto maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved internal controls, or if the Company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the Company’s business and operating results could be harmed. Additionally, the Company may be subject to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities, and the Company could fail to meet its reporting obligations, all of which could have an adverse effect on its business or the market price of the Company’s securities.Failure to comply with the requirements of environmental regulations could adversely affect the Company’s business.The Company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, recycling of products at the end of their useful life and other related matters. While the Company strives to ensure it is in full compliance with all applicable regulations, certain of these regulations impose liability without fault. Additionally, the Company may be held responsible for the prior activities of an entity it acquired. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in substantial costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury. Further, environmental laws may become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations. "

Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors
This Report contains forward-looking statements with respect to the financial condition, results of operations and business of Avnet. These statements are generally identified by words like “believes,” “plans,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “should,” “will,” “may,” “estimates” or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Except as required by law, Avnet does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements include those discussed below.The factors discussed below make the Company’s operating results for future periods difficult to predict and, therefore, prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. Any of the below factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, may have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial results, operations, prospects and liquidity. The Company’s operating results have fluctuated in the past and likely will continue to do so. If the Company’s operating results fall below its forecasts and the expectations of public market analysts and investors, the trading price of the Company’s common stock will likely decrease.Economic weakness and geopolitical uncertainty could adversely affect the Company’s results and prospects.The Company’s financial results, operations and prospects depend significantly on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions, the demand for its products and services, and the financial condition of its customers and suppliers. Economic weakness and geopolitical uncertainty have in the past resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased sales, margins and earnings. Economic weakness and geopolitical uncertainty may also lead the Company to impair assets, including goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets, take restructuring actions and reduce  7 Table of Contentsexpenses in response to decreased sales or margins. The Company may not be able to adequately adjust its cost structure in a timely fashion, which may adversely impact its profitability. Uncertainty about economic conditions may increase foreign currency volatility in markets in which the Company transacts business, which may negatively impact the Company’s results. Economic weakness and geopolitical uncertainty also make it more difficult for the Company to manage inventory levels and/or collect customer receivables, which may result in provisions to create reserves, write-offs, reduced access to liquidity and higher financing costs.The Company experiences significant competitive pressure, which may negatively impact its results.The market for the Company’s products and services is very competitive and subject to rapid technological advances, new market entrants, non-traditional competitors, changes in industry standards and changes in customer needs and consumption models. Not only does the Company compete with other global distributors, it also competes for customers with regional distributors and some of the Company’s own suppliers that maintain direct sales efforts. In addition, as the Company expands its offerings and geographies, the Company may encounter increased competition from current or new competitors. The Company’s failure to maintain and enhance its competitive position could adversely affect its business and prospects. Furthermore, the Company’s efforts to compete in the marketplace could cause deterioration of gross profit margins and, thus, overall profitability.The size of the Company’s competitors vary across market sectors, as do the resources the Company has allocated to the sectors and geographic areas in which it does business. Therefore, some competitors may have greater resources or a more extensive customer or supplier base than the Company has in one or more of its market sectors and geographic areas, which may result in the Company not being able to effectively compete in certain markets which could impact the Company’s profitability and prospects.Changes in customer needs and consumption models could significantly affect the Company’s operating results.Changes in customer needs and consumption models may cause a decline in the Company’s billings, which would have a negative impact on the Company’s financial results. While the Company attempts to identify changes in market conditions as soon as possible, the dynamics of these industries make prediction of and timely reaction to such changes difficult. Future downturns in the semiconductor and embedded solutions industries could adversely affect the Company’s operating results and negatively impact the Company’s ability to maintain its current profitability levels. In addition, the semiconductor industry has historically experienced periodic fluctuations in product supply and demand, often associated with changes in economic conditions, technology and manufacturing capacity. During fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, sales of semiconductors represented approximately 78%, 83%, and 84% of the Company's consolidated sales, respectively, and the Company’s sales, closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor industry. Due to the Company’s increased online sales, system interruptions and delays that make its websites and services unavailable or slow to respond may reduce the attractiveness of its products and services to its customers. If the Company is unable to continually improve the efficiency of its systems, it could cause systems interruptions or delays and adversely affect the Company’s operating results.Failure to maintain or add relationships with key suppliers could adversely affect the Company’s sales.One of the Company’s competitive strengths is the breadth and quality of the suppliers whose products the Company distributes. However, billings of products and services from one of the Company’s suppliers, Texas Instruments (“TI”), accounted for approximately 11% of the Company’s consolidated billings in fiscal 2017. Management expects TI’s products and services to continue to account for roughly a similar percentage of the Company’s consolidated billings in fiscal 2018. The Company’s contracts with its suppliers vary in duration and are generally terminable by either party at will upon notice. To the extent any primary suppliers terminate or significantly  8 Table of Contentsreduce their volume of business with the Company in the future, because of a product shortage, an unwillingness to do business with Avnet, changes in strategy or otherwise, the Company’s business and relationships with its customers could be negatively affected because its customers depend on the Company’s distribution of technology hardware and software from the industry’s leading suppliers. In addition, suppliers’ strategy shifts or performance issues may negatively affect the Company’s financial results. The competitive landscape has also experienced a consolidation among suppliers, which could negatively impact the Company’s profitability and customer base. Further, to the extent that any of the Company’s key suppliers modify the terms of their contracts including, without limitation, the terms regarding price protection, rights of return, rebates or other terms that protect or enhance the Company’s gross margins, it could negatively affect the Company’s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.The Company’s non-U.S. locations represent a significant portion of its sales and, consequently, the Company is exposed to risks associated with operating internationally that could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 approximately 72%, 73% and 73%, respectively, of the Company’s sales came from its operations outside the United States. As a result of the Company’s international operations, in particular those in emerging and developing economies, the Company’s operations are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including, but not limited to, the following: ·potential restrictions on the Company’s ability to repatriate funds from its foreign subsidiaries; ·foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations and the impact on the Company’s results of operations; ·import and export duties and value-added taxes; ·compliance with foreign and domestic import and export regulations, data privacy regulations, business licensing requirements, environmental regulations and anti-corruption laws, the failure of which could result in severe penalties including monetary fines, criminal proceedings and suspension of import or export privileges; ·complex and changing tax laws and regulations;  ·regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ between jurisdictions;  ·economic and political instability (including the uncertainty caused by the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union), terrorism and potential military conflicts or civilian unrest; ·fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure; ·natural disasters and health concerns;  ·differing environmental regulations and employment practices and labor issues; and ·the risk of non-compliance with local laws.In addition to the cost of compliance, the potential criminal penalties for violations of import or export regulations and anti-corruption laws by the Company or its third-party agents create heightened risks for the Company’s international operations. In the event that a governing regulatory body determines that the Company has violated applicable import or export regulations or anti-corruption laws, the Company could be fined significant sums, incur sizable legal defense costs and/or its import or export capabilities could be restricted, which could have a material and adverse effect on the Company’s business. Additionally, allegations that the Company has violated a governmental regulation may negatively impact the Company’s reputation, which may result in customers or suppliers being unwilling to do business with the  9 Table of ContentsCompany. While the Company has adopted measures and controls designed to ensure compliance with these laws, the Company cannot be assured that such measures will be adequate or that its business will not be materially and adversely impacted in the event of an alleged violation.The Company transacts sales, pays expenses, owns assets and incurs liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Because the Company’s consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars, the Company must translate sales, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect during each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the exchanges rates between the U.S. Dollar and other currencies affect the Company’s reported amounts of sales, operating income, assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, unexpected and dramatic changes in foreign currency exchange rates may negatively affect the Company’s earnings from those markets. While the Company may use derivative financial instruments to further reduce its net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will not materially affect the Company’s financial results. Further, foreign currency instability and disruptions in the credit and capital markets may increase credit risks for some of the Company’s customers and may impair its customers’ ability to repay existing obligations.If the Company’s internal information systems fail to function properly, or if the Company is unsuccessful in the implementation, integration or upgrade of information systems, its business operations could suffer.The Company is dependent on its information systems to facilitate the day-to-day operations of the business and to produce timely, accurate and reliable information on financial and operational results. Currently, the Company’s global operations are tracked with multiple information systems. The Company is in the process of implementing a new global enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) platform to meet the current, emerging and future needs of Avnet. This global ERP implementation is extremely complex, in part, because of a wide range of processes, the multiple legacy systems used and the Company’s business operations. There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in implementing this ERP and other information systems or that there will not be implementation or integration difficulties that will adversely affect the Company’s ability to complete business transactions and ensure accurate recording and reporting of financial data. In addition, the Company may be unable to achieve the expected efficiencies and cost savings as a result of the ERP implementation projects, thus negatively impacting the Company’s financial results. A failure of any of these information systems in a way described above or material difficulties in upgrading these information systems could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, internal controls and reporting obligations under federal securities laws.The Company’s acquisition strategy may not produce the expected benefits, which may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.Avnet has made, and expects to continue to make, strategic acquisitions or investments in companies around the world to further its strategic objectives and support key business initiatives. Acquisitions and investments involve risks and uncertainties, some of which may differ from those associated with Avnet’s historical operations. The risks relating to such acquisitions and investments include, but are not limited to, risks relating to expanding into emerging markets and business areas, adding additional product lines and services, impacting existing customer and supplier relationships, incurring costs or liabilities associated with the companies acquired and diverting management’s attention from existing business operations. As a result, the Company’s profitability may be negatively impacted. In addition, the Company may not be successful in integrating the acquired businesses or the integration may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than anticipated. Further, any litigation relating to a potential acquisition will result in an increase in the expenses associated with the acquisition or cause a delay in completing the acquisition, thereby impacting the Company’s profitability. The Company may experience disruptions that could, depending on the size of the acquisition, have an adverse effect on its business, especially where an acquisition target may have pre-existing compliance issues or pre-existing deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting. Furthermore, the Company  10 Table of Contentsmay not realize all of the anticipated benefits from its acquisitions, which could adversely affect the Company’s financial performance.Major disruptions to the Company’s logistics capability could have an adverse impact on the Company’s operations.The Company’s global logistics services are operated through specialized, centralized or outsourced distribution centers around the globe. The Company also depends almost entirely on third-party transportation service providers for the delivery of products to its customers. A major interruption or disruption in service at one or more of its distribution centers for any reason (such as information technology issues, natural disasters, pandemics, or significant disruptions of services from the Company’s third-party transportation providers) could cause cancellations or delays in a significant number of shipments to customers and, as a result, could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business partners, and on the Company’s business, operations and financial performance.If the Company sustains cyber attacks or other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches, it could suffer a loss of sales and increased costs, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm and other negative consequences.The Company’s information technology may be subject to cyber attacks, security breaches or computer hacking. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate the Company’s security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal, proprietary or confidential information, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. They also may be able to develop and deploy malicious software programs that attack the Company’s systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. The Company’s systems and the data stored on those systems may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks, acts of vandalism or theft, coordinated attacks by activist entities, misplaced or lost data, human errors, or other similar events that could negatively affect the Company’s systems and its data, as well as the data of the Company’s business partners. Further, third parties, such as hosted solution providers, that provide services to the Company, could also be a source of security risk in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure.The costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber incident could be significant. The Company’s remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential suppliers or customers. In addition, breaches of the Company’s security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal, proprietary or confidential information about the Company, its business partners or other third parties could expose the Company to significant potential liability and reputational harm. As threats related to cyber attacks develop and grow, the Company may also find it necessary to make further investments to protect its data and infrastructure, which may impact the Company’s profitability. Although the Company has insurance coverage for protecting against cyber attacks, it may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims, and the Company may suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on its business. As a global enterprise, the Company could also be negatively impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, data privacy, data localization and data protection.Declines in the value of the Company’s inventory or unexpected order cancellations by the Company’s customers could adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.The electronic components and integrated products industries are subject to rapid technological change, new and enhanced products, changes in customer needs and changes in industry standards and regulatory requirements, which can contribute to a decline in value or obsolescence of inventory. Regardless of the general economic environment, it is possible that prices will decline due to a decrease in demand or an oversupply of products and, as a result of the price declines, there may be greater risk of declines in inventory value. Although it is the policy of many of the Company’s  11 Table of Contentssuppliers to offer certain protections from the loss in value of inventory (such as price protection and limited rights of return), the Company cannot be assured that such policies will fully compensate for the loss in value, or that the suppliers will choose to, or be able to, honor such agreements, some of which are not documented and, therefore, subject to the discretion of the supplier. In addition, the majority of the Company’s sales are made pursuant to individual purchase orders, rather than through long-term sales contracts. Where there is a contract, such contract is generally terminable at will upon notice. The Company cannot be assured that unforeseen new product developments, declines in the value of the Company’s inventory or unforeseen order cancellations by its customers will not adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.Substantial defaults by the Company’s customers or suppliers on its accounts receivable or the loss of significant customers could have a significant negative impact on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.A significant portion of the Company’s working capital consists of accounts receivable. If entities responsible for a significant amount of accounts receivable were to cease doing business, direct their business elsewhere, become insolvent or unable to pay the amount they owe the Company, or were to become unwilling or unable to make such payments in a timely manner, the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected. An economic or industry downturn could adversely affect the collectability of these accounts receivable, which could result in longer payment cycles, increased collection costs and defaults in excess of management’s expectations. A significant deterioration in the Company’s ability to collect on accounts receivable in the United States could also impact the cost or availability of financing under its accounts receivable securitization program.The Company may not have adequate or cost-effective liquidity or capital resources which could adversely affect the Company’s operations.The Company’s ability to satisfy its cash needs and implement its capital allocation strategy depends on its ability to generate cash from operations and to access the financial markets, both of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond the Company’s control.The Company may need to satisfy its cash needs through external financing. However, external financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. As of July 1, 2017, Avnet had total debt outstanding of approximately $1.78 billion under various notes, secured borrowings and committed and uncommitted lines of credit with financial institutions. The Company needs cash to make interest payments on, and to repay, this indebtedness and for general corporate purposes, such as funding its ongoing working capital and capital expenditure needs. Under the terms of any external financing, the Company may incur higher than expected financing expenses and become subject to additional restrictions and covenants. Any material increase in the Company’s financing costs could have an adverse effect on its profitability. Under certain of its credit facilities, the Company is required to maintain certain specified financial ratios and pass certain financial tests. If the Company fails to meet these financial ratios and/or pass these tests, it may be unable to continue to utilize these facilities. If the Company is unable to utilize these facilities, it may not have sufficient cash available to make interest payments, to repay indebtedness or for general corporate needs. General economic or business conditions, domestic and foreign, may be less favorable than management expects and could adversely impact the Company’s sales or its ability to collect receivables from its customers, which may impact access to the Company’s accounts receivable securitization program. 12 Table of ContentsIn order to be successful, the Company must attract, retain, train, motivate and develop key employees, and failure to do so could adversely impact the Company’s results and strategic initiatives.Identifying, developing internally or hiring externally, training and retaining qualified employees are critical to the Company’s future, and competition for experienced employees in the Company’s industry can be intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers leave the Company.

If the Company loses existing qualified personnel or is unable to hire new qualified personnel, as needed, the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed.The agreements governing some of the Company’s financings contain various covenants and restrictions that limit management’s discretion in operating the business and could prevent management from engaging in some activities that may be beneficial to the Company’s business.The agreements governing the Company’s financing, including its credit facility, accounts receivable securitization program and the indentures governing the Company’s outstanding notes, contain various covenants and restrictions that, in certain circumstances, limit the Company’s ability, and the ability of certain subsidiaries, to: ·grant liens on assets; ·make restricted payments (including, under certain circumstances, paying dividends on common stock or redeeming or repurchasing common stock); ·make certain investments; ·merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of the Company’s assets; ·incur additional debt; or ·engage in certain transactions with affiliates.As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the Company may be limited in the future in how it conducts its business and may be unable to raise additional debt, repurchase common stock, pay a dividend, compete effectively or make further investments.The Company may become involved in intellectual property disputes that could cause it to incur substantial costs, divert management’s efforts or require it to pay substantial damages or licensing fees. From time to time, the Company receives notifications alleging infringements of intellectual property rights allegedly held by others relating to the Company’s business or the products or services it sells. Litigation with respect to patents or other intellectual property matters could result in substantial costs and diversion of management’s efforts and other resources and could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations. Further, the Company may be obligated to indemnify and defend its customers if the products or services the Company sells are alleged to infringe any third party’s intellectual property rights. While the Company may be able to seek indemnification from its suppliers for itself and its customers against such claims, there is no assurance that it will be successful in realizing such indemnification or that the Company will be fully protected against such claims. In addition, the Company is exposed to potential liability for technology that it develops for which it has no indemnification protections. If an infringement claim against the  13 Table of ContentsCompany is successful, the Company may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. The Company may have to stop selling certain products or services, which could affect its ability to compete effectively.Changes in tax rules and regulations, changes in interpretation of tax rules and regulations, changes in business performance or unfavorable assessments from tax audits could adversely affect the Company’s effective tax rates, deferred taxes, financial condition and results of operations.As a multinational corporation, the Company is subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States and many foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, regulations may be enacted that could adversely affect the Company’s tax positions. There can be no assurance that the Company’s cash flow, and in some cases the effective tax rate, will not be adversely affected by these potential changes in regulations or by changes in the interpretation of existing tax law and regulations. The tax laws and regulations of the various countries where the Company has operations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although the Company believes that its historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that these tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that the Company would be successful in defending against any such challenge.The Company’s future income tax expense could also be favorably or adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes to its operating structure.If the Company fails to maintain effective internal controls, it may not be able to report its financial results accurately or timely, or prevent or detect fraud, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business or the market price of the Company’s securities.Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for the Company to provide reliable financial reports and to effectively prevent or detect fraud. If the Company cannot provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent or detect fraud, its brand and operating results could be harmed. Internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because such controls are inherently limited; such limitations include the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls cannot provide absolute assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, if not properly maintained and updated, internal controls over financial reporting may become inadequate. If the Company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved internal controls, or if the Company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the Company’s business and operating results could be harmed. Additionally, the Company may be subject to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities, and the Company could fail to meet its reporting obligations, all of which could have an adverse effect on its business or the market price of the Company’s securities.Failure to comply with the requirements of environmental regulations could adversely affect the Company’s business.The Company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, recycling of products at the end of their useful life and other related matters. While the Company strives to ensure it is in full compliance with all applicable regulations, certain of these regulations impose liability without fault. Additionally, the Company may be held responsible for the prior activities of an entity it acquired. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in substantial costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury. Further, environmental laws may become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations. 14 Table of Contents "

Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors
This Report contains forward-looking statements with respect to the financial condition, results of operations and business of Avnet. These statements are generally identified by words like “believes,” “plans,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “should,” “will,” “may,” “estimates” or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Except as required by law, Avnet does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements include those discussed below.The factors discussed below make the Company’s operating results for future periods difficult to predict and, therefore, prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. Any of the below factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, may have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial results, operations, prospects and liquidity. The Company’s operating results have fluctuated in the past and likely will continue to do so. If the Company’s operating results fall below its forecasts and the expectations of public market analysts and investors, the trading price of the Company’s common stock will likely decrease.Economic weakness and geopolitical uncertainty could adversely affect the Company’s results and prospects.The Company’s financial results, operations and prospects depend significantly on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions, the demand for its products and services, and the financial condition of its customers and suppliers. Economic weakness and geopolitical uncertainty have in the past resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased sales, margins and earnings. Economic weakness and geopolitical uncertainty may also lead the Company to impair assets, including goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets, take restructuring actions and reduce expenses in response to decreased sales or margins. The Company may not be able to adequately adjust its cost structure in a timely fashion, which may adversely impact its profitability. Uncertainty about economic conditions may increase foreign currency volatility in markets in which the Company transacts business, which may negatively impact the Company’s results. Economic weakness and geopolitical uncertainty also make it more difficult for the Company to manage inventory levels and/or collect customer receivables, which may result in provisions to create reserves, write-offs, reduced access to liquidity and higher financing costs.The Company experiences significant competitive pressure, which may negatively impact its results.The market for the Company’s products and services is very competitive and subject to rapid technological advances, new market entrants, non-traditional competitors, changes in industry standards and changes in customer needs and consumption models. Not only does the Company compete with other global distributors, it also competes for customers with regional distributors and some of the Company’s own suppliers that maintain direct sales efforts. In addition, as the Company expands its offerings and geographies, the Company may encounter increased competition from current or new competitors. The Company’s failure to maintain and enhance its competitive position could adversely affect its business and prospects. Furthermore, the Company’s efforts to compete in the marketplace could cause deterioration of gross profit margins and, thus, overall profitability.The size of the Company’s competitors vary across market sectors, as do the resources the Company has allocated to the sectors and geographic areas in which it does business. Therefore, some competitors may have greater resources or a more extensive customer or supplier base than the Company has in one or more of its market sectors and geographic  8 Table of Contentsareas, which may result in the Company not being able to effectively compete in certain markets which could impact the Company’s profitability and prospects.Changes in customer needs and consumption models could significantly affect the Company’s operating results.Changes in customer needs and consumption models may cause a decline in the Company’s billings, which would have a negative impact on the Company’s financial results. As end users migrate to cloud-based IT infrastructure and software-as-a-service, the Company’s sales of hardware products may be reduced, thereby negatively impacting the Company’s results. Further, economic weakness may cause a decline in spending on information technology, hardware or software products, which could have a negative impact on TS. While the Company attempts to identify changes in market conditions as soon as possible, the dynamics of these industries make prediction of and timely reaction to such changes difficult. Future downturns in the semiconductor and technology industries could adversely affect the Company’s operating results and negatively impact the Company’s ability to maintain its current profitability levels. In addition, the semiconductor and IT industries have historically experienced periodic fluctuations in product supply and demand, often associated with changes in economic conditions, technology and manufacturing capacity. During each of the last three fiscal years, sales of semiconductors represented approximately 50% of the Company’s consolidated sales, and the Company’s sales, particularly those of EM, closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor industry. Failure to maintain or add relationships with key suppliers could adversely affect the Company’s sales.One of the Company’s competitive strengths is the breadth and quality of the suppliers whose products the Company distributes. However, billings of products and services from one of the Company’s suppliers, IBM, accounted for approximately 11% of the Company’s consolidated billings in fiscal 2016. Management expects IBM products and services to continue to account for roughly a similar percentage of the Company’s consolidated billings in fiscal 2017. The Company’s contracts with its suppliers, including those with IBM, vary in duration and are generally terminable by either party at will upon notice. To the extent IBM or other primary suppliers significantly reduce their volume of business with the Company in the future, because of a product shortage, an unwillingness to do business with Avnet, changes in strategy or otherwise, the Company’s business and relationships with its customers could be negatively affected because its customers depend on the Company’s distribution of technology hardware and software from the industry’s leading suppliers. In addition, suppliers’ strategy shifts or performance issues may negatively affect the Company’s financial results. The competitive landscape has also experienced a consolidation among suppliers, which could negatively impact the Company’s profitability and customer base. Further, to the extent that any of the Company’s key suppliers modify the terms of their contracts including, without limitation, the terms regarding price protection, rights of return, rebates or other terms that protect or enhance the Company’s gross margins, it could negatively affect the Company’s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.The technology industry is characterized by rapid innovation and the frequent introduction of new and enhanced hardware, software and services offerings. The Company’s success is dependent, in part, on its ability to distribute cutting-edge emerging technology. To the extent that the Company is not able to distribute a product that is highly in demand in one or more geographic areas, or the Company is unable to develop relationships with new technology suppliers that it has not historically represented, the Company’s business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.The Company’s non-U.S. locations represent a significant portion of its sales and, consequently, the Company is exposed to risks associated with operating internationally.During fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 approximately 64%, 64% and 65%, respectively, of the Company’s sales came from its operations outside the United States. As a result of the Company’s international operations, in particular those in  9 Table of Contentsemerging and developing economies, the Company’s operations are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including, but not limited to, the following: ·potential restrictions on the Company’s ability to repatriate funds from its foreign subsidiaries; ·foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations and the impact on the Company’s results of operations; ·import and export duties and value-added taxes; ·compliance with foreign and domestic import and export regulations, data privacy regulations, business licensing requirements, environmental regulations and anti-corruption laws, the failure of which could result in severe penalties including monetary fines, criminal proceedings and suspension of import or export privileges; ·complex and changing tax laws and regulations;  ·regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ between jurisdictions;  ·economic and political instability, terrorism and potential military conflicts or civilian unrest; ·fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure; ·natural disasters and health concerns;  ·differing environmental regulations and employment practices and labor issues; and ·the risk of non-compliance with local laws.In addition to the cost of compliance, the potential criminal penalties for violations of import or export regulations and anti-corruption laws by the Company or its third-party agents create heightened risks for the Company’s international operations. In the event that a governing regulatory body determined that the Company had violated applicable import or export regulations or anti-corruption laws, the Company could be fined significant sums, incur sizable legal defense costs and/or its import or export capabilities could be restricted, which could have a material and adverse effect on the Company’s business. Additionally, allegations that the Company has violated a governmental regulation may negatively impact the Company’s reputation, which may result in customers or suppliers being unwilling to do business with the Company. While the Company has adopted measures and controls designed to ensure compliance with these laws, the Company cannot be assured that such measures will be adequate or that its business will not be materially and adversely impacted in the event of an alleged violation.The Company transacts sales, pays expenses, owns assets and incurs liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Because the Company’s consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars, the Company must translate sales, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect during each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the exchanges rates between the U.S. Dollar and other currencies the Company transacts in affect the Company’s reported amounts of sales, operating income, assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, unexpected and dramatic changes in foreign currency exchange rates may negatively affect the Company’s earnings from those markets. While the Company may use derivative financial instruments to further reduce its net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will not materially affect the Company’s financial results. Further, foreign currency instability and disruptions in the credit and capital markets may increase credit risks for some of the Company’s customers and may impair its customers’ ability to repay existing obligations. 10 Table of ContentsIf the Company’s internal information systems fail to function properly, or if the Company is unsuccessful in the implementation, integration or upgrade of information systems, its business operations could suffer.The Company is dependent on its information systems to facilitate the day-to-day operations of the business and to produce timely, accurate and reliable information on financial and operational results. Currently, the Company’s global operations are tracked with multiple information systems, some of which are subject to ongoing IT projects designed to streamline or optimize the Company’s global information systems. These IT projects are extremely complex, in part, because of a wide range of processes, the multiple legacy systems used and the Company’s business operations. There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful at all times in these efforts or that there will not be implementation or integration difficulties that will adversely affect the Company’s ability to complete business transactions and ensure accurate recording and reporting of financial data. In addition, the Company may be unable to achieve the expected efficiencies and cost savings as a result of the IT projects, thus negatively impacting the Company’s financial results. A failure of any of these information systems in a way described above or material difficulties in upgrading these information systems could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, internal controls and reporting obligations under federal securities laws.The Company’s acquisition strategy may not produce the expected benefits, which may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.Avnet has made, and expects to continue to make, strategic acquisitions or investments in companies around the world to further its strategic objectives and support key business initiatives. Acquisitions and investments involve risks and uncertainties, some of which may differ from those associated with Avnet’s historical operations. The risks relating to such acquisitions and investments include, but are not limited to, risks relating to expanding into emerging markets and business areas, adding additional product lines and services, impacting existing customer and supplier relationships, incurring costs or liabilities associated with the companies acquired and diverting management’s attention from existing business operations. As a result, the Company’s profitability may be negatively impacted. In addition, the Company may not be successful in integrating the acquired businesses or the integration may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than anticipated. Further, any litigation relating to a potential acquisition will result in an increase in the expenses associated with the acquisition or cause a delay in completing the acquisition, thereby impacting the Company’s profitability. The Company may experience disruptions that could, depending on the size of the acquisition, have an adverse effect on its business, especially where an acquisition target may have pre-existing compliance issues or pre-existing deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting. Furthermore, the Company may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from its acquisitions, which could adversely affect the Company’s financial performance.Major disruptions to the Company’s logistics capability could have an adverse impact on the Company’s operations.The Company’s global logistics services are operated through specialized, centralized or outsourced distribution centers around the globe. The Company also depends almost entirely on third-party transportation service providers for the delivery of products to its customers. A major interruption or disruption in service at one or more of its distribution centers for any reason (such as information technology issues, natural disasters, pandemics, or significant disruptions of services from the Company’s third-party transportation providers) could cause cancellations or delays in a significant number of shipments to customers and, as a result, could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business partners, and on the Company’s business, operations and financial performance.If the Company sustains cyber attacks or other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches, it could suffer a loss of sales and increased costs, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm and other negative consequences. 11 Table of ContentsThe Company’s information technology may be subject to cyber attacks, security breaches or computer hacking. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate the Company’s security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal, proprietary or confidential information, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. They also may be able to develop and deploy malicious software programs that attack the Company’s systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. The Company’s systems and the data stored on those systems may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks, acts of vandalism or theft, coordinated attacks by activist entities, misplaced or lost data, human errors, or other similar events that could negatively affect the Company’s systems and its data, as well as the data of the Company’s business partners. Further, third parties, such as hosted solution providers, that provide services to the Company, could also be a source of security risk in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure.The costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber incident could be significant. The Company’s remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential suppliers or customers. In addition, breaches of the Company’s security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal, proprietary or confidential information about the Company, its business partners or other third parties could expose the Company to significant potential liability and reputational harm. As threats related to cyber attacks develop and grow, the Company may also find it necessary to make further investments to protect its data and infrastructure, which may impact the Company’s profitability. Although the Company has insurance coverage for protecting against cyber attacks, it may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims, and the Company may suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on its business.  As a global enterprise, the Company could also be negatively impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, data privacy, data localization and data protection.Declines in the value of the Company’s inventory or unexpected order cancellations by the Company’s customers could adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.The electronic components and computer products industries are subject to rapid technological change, new and enhanced products, changes in customer needs and changes in industry standards and regulatory requirements, which can contribute to a decline in value or obsolescence of inventory. Regardless of the general economic environment, it is possible that prices will decline due to a decrease in demand or an oversupply of products and, as a result of the price declines, there may be greater risk of declines in inventory value. Although it is the policy of many of the Company’s suppliers to offer certain protections from the loss in value of inventory (such as price protection and limited rights of return), the Company cannot be assured that such policies will fully compensate for the loss in value, or that the suppliers will choose to, or be able to, honor such agreements, some of which are not documented and, therefore, subject to the discretion of the supplier. In addition, the majority of the Company’s sales are made pursuant to individual purchase orders, rather than through long-term sales contracts. Where there is a contract, such contract is generally terminable at will upon notice. The Company cannot be assured that unforeseen new product developments, declines in the value of the Company’s inventory or unforeseen order cancellations by its customers will not adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.Substantial defaults by the Company’s customers or suppliers on its accounts receivable or the loss of significant customers could have a significant negative impact on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.A significant portion of the Company’s working capital consists of accounts receivable.  If entities responsible for a significant amount of accounts receivable were to cease doing business, direct their business elsewhere, become insolvent or unable to pay the amount they owe the Company, or were to become unwilling or unable to make such payments in a timely manner, the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity could be  12 Table of Contentsadversely affected. An economic or industry downturn could adversely affect the collectability of these accounts receivable, which could result in longer payment cycles, increased collection costs and defaults in excess of management’s expectations. A significant deterioration in the Company’s ability to collect on accounts receivable in the United States could also impact the cost or availability of financing under its accounts receivable securitization program.The Company may not have adequate or cost-effective liquidity or capital resources.The Company’s ability to satisfy its cash needs and implement its capital allocation strategy depends on its ability to generate cash from operations and to access the financial markets, both of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond the Company’s control.The Company may need to satisfy its cash needs through external financing. However, external financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. As of July 2, 2016, Avnet had total debt outstanding of approximately $2.49 billion under various notes, secured borrowings and committed and uncommitted lines of credit with financial institutions. The Company needs cash to make interest payments on, and to repay, this indebtedness and for general corporate purposes, such as funding its ongoing working capital and capital expenditure needs. Under the terms of any external financing, the Company may incur higher than expected financing expenses and become subject to additional restrictions and covenants. Any material increase in the Company’s financing costs could have an adverse effect on its profitability. Under certain of its credit facilities, the Company is required to maintain certain specified financial ratios and meet certain tests. If the Company fails to meet these financial ratios and/or tests, it may be unable to continue to utilize these facilities. If the Company is unable to utilize these facilities, it may not have sufficient cash available to make interest payments, to repay indebtedness or for general corporate needs. General economic or business conditions, domestic and foreign, may be less favorable than management expects and could adversely impact the Company’s sales or its ability to collect receivables from its customers, which may impact access to the Company’s accounts receivable securitization program.In order to be successful, the Company must attract, retain, train, motivate and develop key employees, and failure to do so could adversely impact the Company’s results and strategic initiatives.In order to be successful, the Company must attract, retain, train, motivate and develop qualified executives and other key employees. Identifying, developing internally or hiring externally, training and retaining qualified employees are critical to the Company’s future, and competition for experienced employees in the Company’s industry can be intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers leave the Company. In addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, and as the Company expands its offerings, realignment, training and hiring of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid. From time to time the Company has effected restructurings, which eliminate a number of positions. Even if such personnel are not directly affected by the restructuring effort, such terminations can have a negative impact on morale and the Company’s ability to attract and hire new qualified personnel in the future. If the Company loses existing qualified personnel or is unable to hire new qualified personnel, as needed, the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed. 13 Table of ContentsThe agreements governing some of the Company’s financings contain various covenants and restrictions that limit the discretion of management in operating its business and could prevent engaging in some activities that may be beneficial to the Company’s business.The agreements governing the Company’s financing, including its credit facility, accounts receivable securitization program and the indentures governing the Company’s outstanding notes, contain various covenants and restrictions that, in certain circumstances, limit the Company’s ability, and the ability of certain subsidiaries, to: ·grant liens on assets; ·make restricted payments (including, under certain circumstances, paying dividends on common stock or redeeming or repurchasing common stock); ·make certain investments; ·merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of the Company’s assets; ·incur additional debt; or ·engage in certain transactions with affiliates.As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the Company may be limited in the future in how it conducts its business and may be unable to raise additional debt, repurchase common stock, pay a dividend, compete effectively or make further investments.The Company may become involved in intellectual property disputes that could cause it to incur substantial costs, divert the efforts of management or require it to pay substantial damages or licensing fees. From time to time, the Company receives notifications alleging infringements of intellectual property rights allegedly held by others relating to the Company’s business or the products or services it sells. Litigation with respect to patents or other intellectual property matters could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and other resources and could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations. Further, the Company may be obligated to indemnify and defend its customers if the products or services the Company sells are alleged to infringe any third party’s intellectual property rights. While the Company may be able to seek indemnification from its suppliers for itself and its customers against such claims, there is no assurance that it will be successful in realizing such indemnification or that the Company will be fully protected against such claims. In addition, the Company is exposed to potential liability for technology that it develops for which it has no indemnification protections. If an infringement claim against the Company is successful, the Company may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. The Company may have to stop selling certain products or services, which could affect its ability to compete effectively.Failure to comply with the requirements of environmental regulations could adversely affect the Company’s business.The Company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, recycling of products at the end of their useful life and other related matters. While the Company strives to ensure it is in full compliance with all applicable regulations, certain of these regulations impose liability without fault. Additionally, the Company may be held responsible for the prior activities of an entity it acquired. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in substantial costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury. Further, environmental laws may become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations. 14 Table of ContentsChanges in tax rules and regulations, changes in interpretation of tax rules and regulations, changes in business performance or unfavorable assessments from tax audits could affect the Company’s effective tax rates, deferred taxes, financial condition and results of operations.As a multinational corporation, the Company is subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States and many foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, regulations may be enacted that could adversely affect the Company’s tax positions. There can be no assurance that the Company’s cash flow, and in some cases the effective tax rate, will not be adversely affected by these potential changes in regulations or by changes in the interpretation of existing tax law and regulations. The tax laws and regulations of the various countries where the Company has operations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although the Company believes that its historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that these tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that the Company would be successful in defending against any such challenge.The Company’s future income tax expense could also be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes to its operating structure.If the Company fails to maintain effective internal controls, it may not be able to report its financial results accurately or timely, or prevent or detect fraud, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business or the market price of the Company’s securities.Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for the Company to provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and to effectively prevent or detect fraud. If the Company cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and effectively prevent or detect fraud, its brand and operating results could be harmed. Internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls cannot provide absolute assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If the Company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved internal controls, or if the Company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the Company’s business and operating results could be harmed, the Company may be subject to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities, and the Company could fail to meet its reporting obligations, which could have an adverse effect on its business or the market price of the Company’s securities. "

Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors
This Report contains forward-looking statements with respect to the financial condition, results of operations and business of Avnet. These statements are generally identified by words like “believes,” “plans,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “should,” “will,” “may,” “estimates” or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Except as required by law, Avnet does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements include those discussed below.The factors discussed below make the Company’s operating results for future periods difficult to predict and, therefore, prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. Any of the below factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, may have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial results, operations, prospects and liquidity. The Company’s operating results have fluctuated in the past and likely will continue to do so. If the Company’s operating results fall below its forecasts and the expectations of public market analysts and investors, the trading price of the Company’s common stock will likely decrease.Economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect the Company’s results and prospects.The Company’s financial results, operations and prospects depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions, the demand for its products and services, and the financial condition of its customers and suppliers. Economic weakness and uncertainty have in the past resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased sales, margins and earnings. Economic weakness and uncertainty may also lead the Company to impair assets, including goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets, take restructuring actions and reduce expenses in response to decreased sales or margins. The Company may not be able to adequately adjust its cost structure in a timely fashion, which may adversely impact its profitability. Uncertainty about economic conditions may increase foreign currency volatility in markets in which the Company transacts business, which may negatively impact the Company’s results. Economic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for the Company to manage inventory levels and/or collect customer receivables, which may result in provisions to create reserves, write-offs, reduced access to liquidity and higher financing costs.The electronic components and computer industries are highly competitive and if the Company fails to compete effectively, its sales, gross profit margins and prospects may decline.The market for the Company’s products and services is very competitive and subject to rapid technological advances, new market entrants, non-traditional competitors, changes in industry standards and changes in customer needs. Not only does the Company compete with other global distributors, it also competes for customers with regional distributors and some of the Company’s own suppliers that maintain direct sales efforts. The Company’s failure to maintain and enhance its competitive position could adversely affect its business and prospects. Furthermore, the Company’s efforts to compete in the marketplace could cause deterioration of gross profit margins and, thus, overall profitability.The size of the Company’s competitors vary across market sectors, as do the resources the Company has allocated to the sectors and geographic areas in which it does business. Therefore, some competitors may have greater resources or a more extensive customer base than the Company has in one or more of its market sectors and geographic areas, which may result in the Company not being able to effectively compete in certain markets which could impact the Company’s profitability and prospects. 8 Table of ContentsAn industry down-cycle in semiconductors, IT hardware or software products could significantly affect the Company’s operating results.The semiconductor and technology industries historically have experienced periodic fluctuations in product supply and demand, often associated with changes in technology and manufacturing capacity, and are generally considered to be highly cyclical. During each of the last three fiscal years, sales of semiconductors represented approximately 50% of the Company’s consolidated sales, and the Company’s sales, particularly those of EM, closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor industry. Further, economic weakness or changes in customer needs could cause a decline in spending on information technology, hardware or software products, which could have a negative impact on TS. While the Company attempts to identify changes in market conditions as soon as possible, the dynamics of these industries make prediction of and timely reaction to such changes difficult. Future downturns in the semiconductor and technology industries could adversely affect the Company’s operating results and negatively impact the Company’s ability to maintain its current profitability levels.Failure to maintain its relationships with key suppliers could adversely affect the Company’s sales.One of the Company’s competitive strengths is the breadth and quality of the suppliers whose products the Company distributes. However, sales of products and services from one of the Company’s suppliers, IBM, accounted for approximately 11% of the Company’s consolidated sales in fiscal 2015. Management expects IBM products and services to continue to account for roughly a similar percentage of the Company’s consolidated sales in fiscal 2016. The Company’s contracts with its suppliers, including those with IBM, vary in duration and are generally terminable by either party at will upon notice. To the extent IBM or other primary suppliers significantly reduce their volume of business with the Company in the future, because of a product shortage, an unwillingness to do business with Avnet, changes in strategy or otherwise, the Company’s business and relationships with its customers could be negatively affected because its customers depend on the Company’s distribution of electronic components and computer products from the industry’s leading suppliers. In addition, suppliers’ strategy shifts or performance issues may negatively affect the Company’s financial results. The competitive landscape has also experienced a consolidation among suppliers, which could negatively impact the Company’s profitability and customer base. Further, to the extent that any of the Company’s key suppliers modify the terms of their contracts including, without limitation, the terms regarding price protection, rights of return, rebates or other terms that protect or enhance the Company’s gross margins, it could negatively affect the Company’s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.The Company’s non-U.S. locations represent a significant portion of its sales and, consequently, the Company is exposed to risks associated with operating internationally.During fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 approximately 64%, 65% and 63%, respectively, of the Company’s sales came from its operations outside the United States. As a result of the Company’s international operations, in particular those in emerging and developing economies, the Company’s operations are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including, but not limited to, the following: ·potential restrictions on the Company’s ability to repatriate funds from its foreign subsidiaries; ·foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations and the impact on the Company’s results of operations; ·import and export duties and value-added taxes; ·compliance with foreign and domestic import and export regulations, data privacy regulations, business licensing requirements, environmental regulations and anti-corruption laws, the failure of which could result in severe penalties including monetary fines, criminal proceedings and suspension of import or export privileges; 9 Table of Contents ·complex and changing tax laws and regulations;  ·regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ between jurisdictions;  ·economic and political instability, terrorism and potential military conflicts or civilian unrest; ·fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure; ·natural disasters and health concerns;  ·differing environmental regulations and employment practices and labor issues; and ·the risk of non-compliance with local laws.In addition to the cost of compliance, the potential criminal penalties for violations of import or export regulations and anti-corruption laws by the Company or its third-party agents create heightened risks for the Company’s international operations. In the event that a governing regulatory body determined that the Company had violated applicable import or export regulations or anti-corruption laws, the Company could be fined significant sums, incur sizable legal defense costs and/or its import or export capabilities could be restricted, which could have a material and adverse effect on the Company’s business. Additionally, allegations that the Company has violated a governmental regulation may negatively impact the Company’s reputation, which may result in customers or suppliers being unwilling to do business with the Company. While the Company has adopted measures and controls designed to ensure compliance with these laws, the Company cannot be assured that such measures will be adequate or that its business will not be materially and adversely impacted in the event of an alleged violation.The Company transacts sales, pays expenses, owns assets and incurs liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Because the Company’s consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars, the Company must translate sales, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect during each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the exchanges rates between the U.S. Dollar and other currencies the Company transacts in affect the Company’s reported amounts of sales, operating income, assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, unexpected and dramatic changes in foreign currency exchange rates may negatively affect the Company’s earnings from those markets. While the Company may use derivative financial instruments to further reduce its net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will not materially affect the Company’s financial results. Further, foreign currency instability and disruptions in the credit and capital markets may increase credit risks for some of the Company’s customers and may impair its customers’ ability to repay existing obligations.The Company’s acquisition strategy may not produce the expected benefits, which may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.Avnet has made, and expects to continue to make, strategic acquisitions or investments in companies around the world to further its strategic objectives and support key business initiatives. Acquisitions and investments involve risks and uncertainties, some of which may differ from those associated with Avnet’s historical operations. The risks relating to such acquisitions and investments include, but are not limited to, risks relating to expanding into emerging markets and business areas, adding additional product lines and services, impacting existing customer and supplier relationships, incurring costs or liabilities associated with the companies acquired and diverting management’s attention from existing business operations. As a result, the Company’s profitability may be negatively impacted. In addition, the Company may not be successful in integrating the acquired businesses or the integration may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than anticipated. Further, any litigation relating to a potential acquisition will result in an increase in the expenses  10 Table of Contentsassociated with the acquisition or cause a delay in completing the acquisition, thereby impacting the Company’s profitability. The Company may experience disruptions that could, depending on the size of the acquisition, have an adverse effect on its business, especially where an acquisition target may have pre-existing compliance issues or pre-existing deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls. Furthermore, the Company may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from its acquisitions, which could adversely affect the Company’s financial performance.Major disruptions to the Company’s logistics capability could have an adverse impact on the Company’s operations.The Company’s global logistics services are operated through specialized, centralized or outsourced distribution centers around the globe. The Company also depends almost entirely on third-party transportation service providers for the delivery of products to its customers. A major interruption or disruption in service at one or more of its distribution centers for any reason (such as natural disasters, pandemics, or significant disruptions of services from the Company’s third-party transportation providers) could cause cancellations or delays in a significant number of shipments to customers and, as a result, could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business partners, and on the Company’s business, operations and financial performance.If the Company sustains cyber attacks or other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches, it could suffer a loss of sales and increased costs, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm and other negative consequences.The Company’s information technology may be subject to cyber attacks, security breaches or computer hacking. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate the Company’s security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal, proprietary or confidential information, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. They also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack the Company’s systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. The Company’s systems and the data stored on those systems may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks, acts of vandalism or theft, coordinated attacks by activist entities, misplaced or lost data, human errors, or other similar events that could negatively affect the Company’s systems and its data, as well as the data of the Company’s business partners. Further, third parties, such as hosted solution providers, that provide services to the Company, could also be a source of security risk in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure.The costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber incident could be significant. The Company’s remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential suppliers or customers. In addition, breaches of the Company’s security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal, proprietary or confidential information about the Company, its business partners or other third parties could expose the Company to significant potential liability and reputational harm. As threats related to cyber attacks develop and grow, the Company may also find it necessary to make further investments to protect its data and infrastructure, which may impact the Company’s profitability. Although the Company has insurance coverage for protecting against cyber attacks, it may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims, and the Company may suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on its business.  As a global enterprise, the Company could also be negatively impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, privacy, data localization and data protection.If the Company’s internal information systems fail to function properly, or if the Company is unsuccessful in the implementation, integration or upgrade of information systems, its business operations could suffer.The Company  is  dependent on its information systems to facilitate the day-to-day operations of the business and to produce timely, accurate and reliable information on financial and operational results. Currently, the Company’s global  11 Table of Contentsoperations are tracked with multiple information systems, some of which are subject to ongoing IT projects designed to streamline or optimize the Company’s global information systems. There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful at all times in these efforts or that there will not be implementation or integration difficulties that will adversely affect the Company’s ability to complete business transactions timely or the accurate and timely recording and reporting of financial data. A failure of any of these information systems in a way described above or material difficulties in upgrading these information systems could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business and its compliance with reporting obligations under federal securities laws.Declines in the value of the Company’s inventory or unexpected order cancellations by the Company’s customers could adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.The electronic components and computer products industries are subject to rapid technological change, new and enhanced products, changes in customer needs and changes in industry standards, which can contribute to a decline in value or obsolescence of inventory. Regardless of the general economic environment, it is possible that prices will decline due to a decrease in demand or an oversupply of products and, as a result of the price declines, there may be greater risk of declines in inventory value. Although it is the policy of many of the Company’s suppliers to offer certain protections from the loss in value of inventory (such as price protection and limited rights of return), the Company cannot be assured that such policies will fully compensate for the loss in value, or that the suppliers will choose to, or be able to, honor such agreements, some of which are not documented and, therefore, subject to the discretion of the supplier. In addition, the majority of the Company’s sales are made pursuant to individual purchase orders, rather than through long-term sales contracts. Where there is a contract, such contract is generally terminable at will upon notice. The Company cannot be assured that unforeseen new product developments, declines in the value of the Company’s inventory or unforeseen order cancellations by its customers will not adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.Substantial defaults by the Company’s customers or suppliers on its accounts receivable or the loss of significant customers could have a significant negative impact on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.A significant portion of the Company’s working capital consists of accounts receivable.  If  entities responsible for a significant amount of accounts receivable were to cease doing business, direct their business elsewhere, become insolvent or unable to pay the amount they owe the Company, or were to become unwilling or unable to make such payments in a timely manner, the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected. An economic or industry downturn could adversely affect the collectability of these accounts receivable, which could result in longer payment cycles, increased collection costs and defaults in excess of management’s expectations. A significant deterioration in the Company’s ability to collect on accounts receivable in the United States could also impact the cost or availability of financing under its accounts receivable securitization program.The Company may not have adequate or cost-effective liquidity or capital resources.The Company’s ability to satisfy its cash needs and implement its capital allocation strategy depends on its ability to generate cash from operations and to access the financial markets, both of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond the Company’s control.The Company may need to satisfy its cash needs through external financing. However, external financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. As of June 27, 2015, Avnet had total debt outstanding of approximately $1.98 billion under various notes, secured borrowings and committed and uncommitted lines of credit with financial institutions. The Company needs cash to make interest payments on, and to repay, this indebtedness and for general corporate purposes,  12 Table of Contentssuch as funding its ongoing working capital and capital expenditure needs. Under the terms of any external financing, the Company may incur higher than expected financing expenses and become subject to additional restrictions and covenants. Any material increase in the Company’s financing costs could have an adverse effect on its profitability. Under certain of its credit facilities, the Company is required to maintain certain specified financial ratios and meet certain tests. If the Company fails to meet these financial ratios and/or tests, it may be unable to continue to utilize these facilities. If the Company is unable to utilize these facilities, it may not have sufficient cash available to make interest payments, to repay indebtedness or for general corporate needs. General economic or business conditions, domestic and foreign, may be less favorable than management expects and could adversely impact the Company’s sales or its ability to collect receivables from its customers, which may impact access to the Company’s accounts receivable securitization program.The agreements governing some of the Company’s financings contain various covenants and restrictions that limit the discretion of management in operating its business and could prevent engaging in some activities that may be beneficial to the Company’s business.The agreements governing the Company’s financing, including its credit facility, accounts receivable securitization program and the indentures governing the Company’s outstanding notes, contain various covenants and restrictions that, in certain circumstances, limit the Company’s ability, and the ability of certain subsidiaries, to: ·grant liens on assets; ·make restricted payments (including, under certain circumstances, paying dividends on common stock or redeeming or repurchasing common stock); ·make certain investments; ·merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of the Company’s assets; ·incur additional debt; or ·engage in certain transactions with affiliates.As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the Company may be limited in the future in how it conducts its business and may be unable to raise additional debt, repurchase common stock, pay a dividend, compete effectively or make further investments.The Company may become involved in intellectual property disputes that could cause it to incur substantial costs, divert the efforts of management or require it to pay substantial damages or licensing fees. From time to time, the Company receives notifications alleging infringements of intellectual property rights allegedly held by others relating to the Company’s business or the products or services it sells. Litigation with respect to patents or other intellectual property matters could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and other resources and could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations. Further, the Company may be obligated to indemnify and defend its customers if the products or services the Company sells are alleged to infringe any third party’s intellectual property rights. While the Company may be able to seek indemnification from its suppliers for itself and its customers against such claims, there is no assurance that it will be successful in realizing such indemnification or that the Company will be fully protected against such claims. In addition, the Company is exposed to potential liability for technology that it develops for which it has no indemnification protections. If an infringement claim against the Company is successful, the Company may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on  13 Table of Contentscommercially reasonable terms. The Company may have to stop selling certain products or services, which could affect its ability to compete effectively.Failure to comply with the requirements of environmental regulations could adversely affect the Company’s business.The Company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, recycling of products at the end of their useful life and other related matters. While the Company strives to ensure it is in full compliance with all applicable regulations, certain of these regulations impose liability without fault. Additionally, the Company may be held responsible for the prior activities of an entity it acquired. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in substantial costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury. Further, environmental laws may become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations.Changes in tax rules and regulations, changes in interpretation of tax rules and regulations, changes in business performance or unfavorable assessments from tax audits could affect the Company’s effective tax rates, deferred taxes, financial condition and results of operations.As a multinational corporation, the Company is subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States and many foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, regulations may be enacted that could adversely affect the Company’s tax positions. There can be no assurance that the Company’s cash flow, and in some cases the effective tax rate,  will not be adversely affected by these potential changes in regulations or by changes in the interpretation of existing tax law and regulations. The tax laws and regulations of the various countries where the Company has operations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although the Company believes that its historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that these tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that the Company would be successful in defending against any such challenge.The Company’s future income tax expense could also be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes to its operating structure.If the Company fails to maintain effective internal controls, it may not be able to report its financial results accurately or timely, or prevent or detect fraud, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business or the market price of the Company’s securities.Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for the Company to provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and to effectively prevent or detect fraud. If the Company cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and effectively prevent or detect fraud, its brand and operating results could be harmed. Internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls cannot provide absolute assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If the Company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved internal controls, or if the Company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the Company’s business and operating results could be harmed, the Company may be subject to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities, and the Company could fail to meet its reporting obligations, which could have an adverse effect on its business or the market price of the Company’s securities. 14 Table of Contents "

Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors
This Report contains forward-looking statements with respect to the financial condition, results of operations and business of Avnet. These statements are generally identified by words like “believes,” “plans,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “should,” “will,” “may,” “estimates” or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties.  Except as required by law, Avnet does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements include those discussed below.  The factors discussed below make the Company’s operating results for future periods difficult to predict and, therefore, prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. Any of the below factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, may have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial results, operations, prospects and liquidity. The Company’s operating results have fluctuated in the past and likely will continue to do so.  If the Company’s operating results fall below its forecasts and the expectations of public market analysts and investors, the trading price of the Company’s common stock will likely decrease.Economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect the Company’s results and prospects.The Company's financial results, operations and prospects depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions, the demand for its products and services, and the financial condition of its customers and suppliers. Economic weakness and uncertainty have in the past resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased revenues, margins, earnings and asset impairments, including goodwill and other intangible assets. Economic weakness and uncertainty may also lead the Company to take restructuring actions and reduce associated expenses in response to decreased revenues or margins. The Company may not be able to adequately adjust its cost structure in a timely fashion, which may adversely impact its profitability. Economic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for the Company to manage inventory levels and/or collect customer receivables, which may result in reduced access to liquidity and higher financing costs.7The electronic components and computer industries are highly competitive and if the Company fails to compete effectively, its revenues, gross profit margins and prospects may decline.The market for the Company's products and services is very competitive and subject to rapid technological advances, new market entrants, non-traditional competitors, changes in industry standards and changes in customer needs. Not only does the Company compete with other global distributors, it also competes for customers with regional distributors and some of the Company's own suppliers that maintain direct sales efforts. The Company's failure to maintain and enhance its competitive position could adversely affect its business and prospects. Furthermore, the Company's efforts to compete in the marketplace could cause deterioration of gross profit margins and, thus, overall profitability.The size of the Company's competitors vary across market sectors, as do the resources the Company has allocated to the sectors and geographic areas in which it does business. Therefore, some competitors may have greater resources or a more extensive customer base than the Company has in one or more of its market sectors and geographic areas, which may result in the Company not being able to effectively compete in certain markets which could impact the Company's profitability and prospects.An industry down-cycle in semiconductors could significantly affect the Company's operating results as a large portion of revenues and gross profit come from sales of semiconductors, which is a highly cyclical industry.The semiconductor industry historically has experienced periodic fluctuations in product supply and demand, often associated with changes in technology and manufacturing capacity, and is generally considered to be highly cyclical. During each of the last three fiscal years, sales of semiconductors represented approximately 50% of the Company's consolidated revenues, and the Company's revenues, particularly those of EM, closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor industry. While the Company attempts to identify changes in market conditions as soon as possible, the dynamics of the industry make prediction of and timely reaction to such changes difficult. Future downturns in the technology industry, particularly in the semiconductor sector, could adversely affect the Company's operating results and negatively impact the Company's ability to maintain its current profitability levels.Failure to maintain its relationships with key suppliers could adversely affect the Company’s sales.One of the Company's competitive strengths is the breadth and quality of the suppliers whose products the Company distributes. However, sales of products and services from one of the Company's suppliers, IBM, accounted for approximately 13% of the Company's consolidated revenues in fiscal 2014. Management expects IBM products and services to continue to account for roughly a similar percentage of the Company's consolidated sales in fiscal 2015. The Company's contracts with its suppliers, including those with IBM, vary in duration and are generally terminable by either party at will upon notice. To the extent IBM or other primary suppliers significantly reduce their volume of business with the Company in the future, because of a product shortage, an unwillingness to do business with Avnet, or otherwise, the Company's business and relationships with its customers could be negatively affected because its customers depend on the Company's distribution of electronic components and computer products from the industry's leading suppliers.  In addition, suppliers’ strategy shifts or performance issues may negatively affect the Company’s financial results.  Further, to the extent that any of the Company's key suppliers modify the terms of their contracts including, without limitation, the terms regarding price protection, rights of return, rebates or other terms that protect or enhance the Company's gross margins, it could negatively affect the Company's results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.The Company's non-U.S. locations represent a significant portion of its revenue and, consequently, the Company is exposed to risks associated with operating internationally.During fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 approximately 65%, 63% and 61%, respectively, of the Company's sales came from its operations outside the United States. As a result of the Company's international operations, in particular those in emerging and developing economies, the Company's operations are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including, but not limited to, the following:•potential restrictions on the Company's ability to repatriate funds from its foreign subsidiaries;•foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations and the impact on the Company's reported results of operations;•import and export duties and value-added taxes;•compliance with foreign and domestic import and export regulations, data privacy regulations, business licensing requirements, environmental regulations and anti-corruption laws, the failure of which could result in severe penalties including monetary fines, criminal proceedings and suspension of import or export privileges;8•complex and changing tax laws and regulations; •regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ between jurisdictions; •economic and political instability, terrorism and potential military conflicts or civilian unrest;•fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure;•natural disasters and health concerns; •differing environmental regulations and employment practices and labor issues; and•the risk of non-compliance with local laws.In addition to the cost of compliance, the potential criminal penalties for violations of export regulations and anti-corruption laws by the Company or its third-party agents create heightened risks for the Company's international operations. In the event that a governing regulatory body determined that the Company had violated applicable import or export regulations or anti-corruption laws, the Company could be fined significant sums, incur sizable legal defense costs and/or its import or export capabilities could be restricted, which could have a material and adverse effect on the Company's business. Additionally, allegations that the Company has violated a governmental regulation may negatively impact the Company's reputation, which may result in customers or suppliers being unwilling to do business with the Company. While the Company has adopted measures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, the Company cannot be assured that such measures will be adequate or that its business will not be materially and adversely impacted in the event of an alleged violation.The Company's acquisition strategy may not produce the expected benefits, which may adversely affect the Company's results of operations.Avnet has made, and expects to continue to make, strategic acquisitions or investments in companies around the world to further its strategic objectives and support key business initiatives. Acquisitions and investments involve risks and uncertainties, some of which may differ from those associated with Avnet's historical operations. The risks relating to such acquisitions and investments include, but are not limited to, risks relating to expanding into emerging markets and business areas, adding additional product lines and services, incurring costs or liabilities associated with the companies acquired and diverting management's attention from existing business operations. As a result, the Company's profitability may be negatively impacted. In addition, the Company may not be successful in integrating the acquired businesses or the integration may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than anticipated. Further, any litigation relating to a potential acquisition will result in an increase in the expenses associated with the acquisition or cause a delay in completing the acquisition, thereby impacting the Company's profitability. The Company may experience disruptions that could, depending on the size of the acquisition, have an adverse effect on its business, especially where an acquisition target may have pre-existing non-compliance or pre-existing deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls as those terms are defined under relevant SEC rules and regulations. Furthermore, the Company may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from its acquisitions, which could adversely affect the Company's financial performance.Major disruptions to the Company’s logistics capability could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s operations.The Company's global logistics services are operated through specialized, centralized or outsourced distribution centers around the globe. The Company also depends almost entirely on third-party transportation service providers for the delivery of products to its customers. A major interruption or disruption in service at one or more of its distribution centers for any reason (such as natural disasters, pandemics, or significant disruptions of services from the Company’s third-party transportation providers) could cause cancellations or delays in a significant number of shipments to customers and, as a result, could have a severe impact on the Company's business, operations and financial performance.If the Company’s internal information systems fail to function properly or experience a security breach, or if the Company is unsuccessful in the implementation, integration or upgrade of information systems, its business operations could suffer.The Company's expanding operations put increasing pressure on the Company's information systems to facilitate the day-to-day operations of the business and to produce timely, accurate and reliable information on financial and operational results. Currently, the Company's global operations are tracked with multiple information systems, some of which are subject to ongoing IT projects designed to streamline or optimize the Company's global information systems. There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful at all times in these efforts or that there will not be implementation or integration difficulties that will adversely affect the Company's ability to complete business transactions timely or the accurate and timely recording and reporting of financial 9data. A failure of any of these information systems in a way described above or material difficulties in upgrading these information systems could have an adverse effect on the Company's business and its compliance with reporting obligations under federal securities laws.  In addition, the Company's information technology may be subject to cybersecurity breaches, computer hacking or other general system failures. Maintaining and operating these systems requires continuous investments. A security breach could result in sensitive data being lost, manipulated or exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public.  Such a breach may harm the Company’s reputation and business prospects and subject the Company to legal claims if there is loss, disclosure or misappropriation of or access to the Company’s business partners' information.  As threats related to cybersecurity breaches develop and grow, the Company may also find it necessary to make further investments to protect its data and infrastructure, which may impact the Company’s profitability.Declines in the value of the Company's inventory or unexpected order cancellations by the Company's customers could adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.The electronic components and computer products industries are subject to rapid technological change, new and enhanced products, changes in customer needs and changes in industry standards, which can contribute to a decline in value or obsolescence of inventory. Regardless of the general economic environment, it is possible that prices will decline due to a decrease in demand or an oversupply of products and, as a result of the price declines, there may be greater risk of declines in inventory value. Although it is the policy of many of the Company's suppliers to offer distributors like Avnet certain protections from the loss in value of inventory (such as price protection and limited rights of return), the Company cannot be assured that such policies will fully compensate for the loss in value, or that the vendors will choose to, or be able to, honor such agreements, some of which are not documented and, therefore, subject to the discretion of the vendor. In addition, the majority of the Company's sales are made pursuant to individual purchase orders, rather than through long-term sales contracts. Where there is a contract, such contract is generally terminable at will upon notice.  The Company cannot be assured that unforeseen new product developments, declines in the value of the Company's inventory or unforeseen order cancellations by its customers will not adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.Substantial defaults by the Company's customers on its accounts receivable or the loss of significant customers could have a significant negative impact on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.A significant portion of the Company's working capital consists of accounts receivable from customers. If customers responsible for a significant amount of accounts receivable were to cease doing business, direct their business elsewhere, become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay the amount they owe the Company, or were to become unwilling or unable to make such payments in a timely manner, the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected. An economic or industry downturn could adversely affect the collectability of these accounts receivable, which could result in longer payment cycles, increased collection costs and defaults in excess of management's expectations. A significant deterioration in the Company's ability to collect on accounts receivable could also impact the cost or availability of financing under its accounts receivable securitization program (see Financing Transactions appearing in Item 7 of this Report).The Company may not have adequate or cost-effective liquidity or capital resources.The Company's ability to satisfy its cash needs and implement its capital allocation strategy depends on its ability to generate cash from operations and to access the financial markets, both of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond the Company's control.The Company may need to satisfy its cash needs through external financing. However, external financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. As of June 28, 2014, Avnet had total debt outstanding of approximately $2.1 billion under various notes, secured borrowings and committed and uncommitted lines of credit with financial institutions. The Company needs cash to make interest payments on, and to repay, this indebtedness and for general corporate purposes, such as funding its ongoing working capital and capital expenditure needs. Under the terms of any external financing, the Company may incur higher than expected financing expenses and become subject to additional restrictions and covenants. Any material increase in the Company's financing costs could have a material adverse effect on its profitability. Under certain of its credit facilities, the Company is required to maintain certain specified financial ratios and meet certain tests. If the Company fails to meet these financial ratios and/or tests, it may be unable to continue to utilize these facilities. If the Company is unable to utilize these facilities, it may not have sufficient cash available to make interest payments on and repay indebtedness and for general corporate needs. General economic or business conditions, domestic and foreign, may be less favorable than management expects and could adversely impact the Company's sales or its ability to collect receivables from its customers, which may impact access to the Company's securitization program.10The agreements governing some of the Company's financings contain various covenants and restrictions that limit the discretion of management in operating its business and could prevent engaging in some activities that may be beneficial to the Company's business.The agreements governing the Company's financing, including its credit facility and the indentures governing the Company's outstanding notes, contain various covenants and restrictions that, in certain circumstances, limit the Company's ability, and the ability of certain subsidiaries, to:•grant liens on assets;•make restricted payments (including, under certain circumstances, paying dividends on common stock or redeeming or repurchasing common stock);•make certain investments;•merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of the Company’s assets;•incur additional debt; or•engage in certain transactions with affiliates.As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the Company may be limited in the future in how it conducts its business and may be unable to raise additional debt, repurchase common stock, pay a dividend, compete effectively or make further investments.The Company may become involved in intellectual property disputes that could cause it to incur substantial costs, divert the efforts of management or require it to pay substantial damages or licensing fees.  From time to time, the Company receives notifications alleging infringements of intellectual property rights allegedly held by others relating to the Company's business or the products or services it sells. Litigation with respect to patents or other intellectual property matters could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and other resources and could have an adverse effect on the Company's operations. Further, the Company may be obligated to indemnify and defend its customers if the products or services the Company sells are alleged to infringe any third party's intellectual property rights. While the Company may be able to seek indemnification from its suppliers for itself and its customers against such claims, there is no assurance that it will be successful in obtaining such indemnification or that the Company will be fully protected against such claims.  In addition, the Company is exposed to potential liability for technology that it develops for which it has no indemnification protections.  If an infringement claim is successful, the Company may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. The Company may have to stop selling certain products or services, which could affect its ability to compete effectively. Failure to comply with the requirements of environmental regulations could adversely affect the Company’s business.The Company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, recycling of products at the end of their useful life and other related matters. While the Company strives to ensure it is in full compliance with all applicable regulations, certain of these regulations impose liability without fault. Additionally, the Company may be held responsible for the prior activities of an entity it acquired. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in substantial costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury. Further, environmental laws may become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations. Tax legislation initiatives or challenges to the Company's tax positions could impact the Company's results of operations and financial condition.As a multinational corporation, the Company is subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States and many foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, regulations may be enacted that could adversely affect the Company's tax positions. There can be no assurance that the Company’s effective tax rate and the resulting cash flow will not be adversely affected by these potential changes in regulations. The tax laws and regulations of the various countries where the Company has operations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although the Company believes that its historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that these tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that the Company would be successful in any such challenge. 11If the Company fails to maintain effective internal controls, it may not be able to report its financial results accurately or timely, or prevent or detect fraud, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business or the market price of the Company's securities.Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for the Company to provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and to effectively prevent or detect fraud. If the Company cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and effectively prevent or detect fraud, its brand and operating results could be harmed. Internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls cannot provide absolute assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If the Company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved internal controls, or if the Company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the Company's business and operating results could be harmed, the Company may be subject to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities, and the Company could fail to meet its reporting obligations, which could have an adverse effect on its business or the market price of the Company's securities"

Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors
This Report contains forward-looking statements with respect to the financial condition, results of operations and business of Avnet.  These statements are generally identified by words like “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “should,” “will,” “may,” “estimates” or similar expressions.  Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties.Except as required by law, Avnet does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements include the following:Economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our results and prospects.The Company's results, operations and prospects depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions, the demand for its products and services, and the financial condition of its customers and suppliers.  Economic weakness and uncertainty, including ongoing macroeconomic issues in many countries, have in the past resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased revenues, margins, earnings and impairments to long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets.  Economic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for the Company to manage inventory levels and/or collect customer receivables, which may result in reduced access to liquidity and higher financing costs.The electronics component and computer industries are highly competitive and if the Company fails to compete effectively, its revenues, gross profit margins and prospects may decline.The market for the Company's products and services is very competitive and subject to rapid technological advances, new market entrants, changes in industry standards and changes in customer needs.  Not only does the Company compete with other global distributors, it also competes for customers with regional distributors and some of the Company's own suppliers that maintain direct sales efforts.  The Company's failure to maintain and enhance its competitive position could adversely affect its business and prospects.  Furthermore, the Company's efforts to compete in the marketplace could cause deterioration of gross profit margins and, thus, overall profitability.7Table of ContentsThe size of the Company's competitors vary across market sectors, as do the resources the Company has allocated to the sectors and geographic areas in which it does business. Therefore, some competitors may have greater financial, personnel, capacity and other resources or a more extensive customer base than the Company has in one or more of its market sectors and geographic areas, which may result in the Company not being able to effectively compete in certain markets which could impact the Company's profitability and prospects.An industry down-cycle in semiconductors could significantly affect the Company's operating results as a large portion of revenues come from sales of semiconductors, which is a highly cyclical industry.The  semiconductor industry historically has experienced periodic fluctuations in product supply and demand, often associated with changes in technology and manufacturing capacity, and is generally considered to be highly cyclical.  During each of the last three fiscal years, sales of semiconductors represented over 50% of the Company's consolidated sales, and the Company's revenues, particularly those of EM, closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor market. Future downturns in the technology industry, particularly in the semiconductor sector, could negatively affect the Company's operating results and negatively impact the Company's ability to maintain its current profitability levels.Failure to maintain its relationships with key suppliers could adversely affect the Company’s sales.One of the Company's competitive strengths is the breadth and quality of the suppliers whose products the Company distributes.  However, sales of products and services from one of the Company's suppliers, IBM, accounted for approximately 12% of the Company's consolidated sales in fiscal year 2013.  Management expects IBM products and services to continue to account for roughly a similar percentage of the Company's consolidated sales in fiscal year 2014.  The Company's contracts with its suppliers, including those with IBM, vary in duration and are generally terminable by either party at will upon notice.  To the extent IBM or other primary suppliers significantly reduce their volume of business with the Company in the future, because of a product shortage, an unwillingness to do business with Avnet, or otherwise, the Company's business and relationships with its customers could be materially and adversely affected because its customers depend on the Company's distribution of electronic components and computer products from the industry's leading suppliers.  In addition, to the extent that any of the Company's key suppliers modify the terms of their contracts including, without limitation, the terms regarding price protection, rights of return, rebates or other terms that protect or enhance the Company's gross margins, it could materially and adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.The Company's non-U.S. locations represent a significant portion of its revenue, and consequently, the Company is increasingly exposed to risks associated with operating internationally.During fiscal year 2013, 2012 and 2011, approximately 63%, 61% and 62%, respectively, of the Company's sales came from its operations outside the United States.  As a result of the Company's foreign sales and locations, in particular those in emerging and developing economies, the Company's operations are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including, but not limited to, the following:•potential restrictions on the Company's ability to repatriate funds from its foreign subsidiaries;•foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations and the impact on the Company's reported results of operations;•import and export duties and value-added taxes; •compliance with foreign and domestic import and export regulations, data privacy regulations, business licensing requirements, environmental regulations and anti-corruption laws, the failure of which could result in severe penalties including monetary fines, criminal proceedings and suspension of import or export privileges;•changing tax laws and regulations; •regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ between jurisdictions; •economic and political instability, terrorism and potential military conflicts or civilian unrest;•fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure;•natural disasters and health concerns; •differing environmental regulations and employment practices and labor issues; and8Table of Contents•the risk of non-compliance with local laws. In addition to the cost of compliance, the potential criminal penalties for violations of export regulations and anti-corruption laws by the Company or its third-party agents create heightened risks for the Company's international operations.  In the event that a governing regulatory body determined that the Company had violated applicable import or export regulations or anti-corruption laws, the Company could be fined significant sums, incur sizable legal defense costs and/or its import or export capabilities could be restricted, which could have a material and adverse effect on the Company's business.  Additionally, allegations that the Company has violated a governmental regulation may negatively impact the Company's reputation, which may result in customers or suppliers being unwilling to do business with the Company. While the Company has adopted measures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, the Company cannot be assured that such measures will be adequate or that its business will not be materially and adversely impacted in the event of an alleged violation.The Company's acquisition strategy may not produce the expected benefits, which may adversely affect the Company's results of operations.Avnet has made, and expects to continue to make, strategic acquisitions or investments in companies around the world to further its strategic objectives and support key business initiatives.  Acquisitions and investments involve risks and uncertainties, some of which may differ from those associated with Avnet's historical operations.  The risks relating to such transactions include, but are not limited to, risks relating to expanding into emerging markets and business areas, adding additional product lines and services, incurring unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the companies acquired and diverting management's attention from existing business operations.  As a result, the Company's profitability may be negatively impacted.  In addition, the Company may not be successful in integrating the acquired businesses or the integration may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than anticipated.  Further, any litigation relating to a potential acquisition will result in an increase in the expenses associated with the acquisition or cause a delay in completing the acquisition, thereby impacting the Company's profitability.  The Company may experience disruptions that could, depending on the size of the acquisition, have a material adverse effect on its business, especially where an acquisition target may have pre-existing non-compliance or pre-existing deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls as those terms are defined under relevant SEC rules and regulations.  Furthermore, the Company may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from its acquisitions, which could materially and adversely affect the Company's financial performance.Major disruptions to the Company’s logistics capability could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s operations.The Company's global logistics services are operated through specialized, centralized or outsourced distribution centers around the globe.  The Company also depends almost entirely on third-party transportation service providers for the delivery of products to its customers.  A major interruption or disruption in service at one or more of its distribution centers for any reason (such as natural disasters, pandemics, or significant disruptions of services from our third-party providers) could cause cancellations or delays in a significant number of shipments to customers and, as a result, could have a severe impact on the Company's business, operations and financial performance.If the Company’s internal information systems fail to function properly, or if the Company is unsuccessful in the integration or upgrade of information systems, its business operations could suffer.The Company's expanding operations put increasing pressure on the Company's information systems to facilitate the day-to-day operations of the business and to produce timely, accurate and reliable reports on financial and operational results.  Currently, the Company's global operations are tracked with multiple information systems, some of which are subject to ongoing IT projects designed to streamline or optimize the Company's global information systems.  There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful at all times in these efforts or that there will not be integration difficulties that will adversely affect the Company's ability to complete business transactions timely or the accurate and timely recording and reporting of financial data.  In addition, the Company's information technology is subject to cybersecurity breaches, computer hacking or other general system failures.  Maintaining and operating these systems requires continuous investments. A security breach could result in sensitive data being manipulated or exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public.  A failure of any of these information systems in a way described above or material difficulties in upgrading these information systems could have material adverse effects on the Company's business and its compliance with reporting obligations under federal securities laws. Declines in the value of the Company's inventory or unexpected order cancellations by the Company's customers could materially and adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.The electronic components and computer products industries are subject to rapid technological change, new and enhanced products, changes in customer needs and changes in industry standards, which can contribute to a decline in value or obsolescence of inventory.  Regardless of the general economic environment, it is possible that prices will decline due to a decrease in demand or an oversupply of products and, as a result of the price declines, there may be greater risk of declines in inventory value.  Although 9Table of Contentsit is the policy of many of the Company's suppliers to offer distributors like Avnet certain protections from the loss in value of inventory (such as price protection and limited rights of return), the Company cannot be assured that such policies will fully compensate for the loss in value, or that the vendors will choose to, or be able to, honor such agreements, some of which are not documented and, therefore, subject to the discretion of the vendor.  In addition, the majority of the Company's sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders, and the Company generally does not have long-term supply arrangements with its customers.  Generally, the Company's customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment with minimal penalties.  The Company cannot be assured that unforeseen new product developments, declines in the value of the Company's inventory or unforeseen order cancellations by its customers will not materially and adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.Substantial defaults by the Company's customers on its accounts receivable or the loss of significant customers could have a significant negative impact on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.A significant portion of the Company's working capital consists of accounts receivable from customers.  If customers responsible for a significant amount of accounts receivable were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay the amount they owe the Company, or were to become unwilling or unable to make such payments in a timely manner, the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected.  An economic or industry downturn could adversely and materially affect the servicing of these accounts receivable, which could result in longer payment cycles, increased collection costs and defaults in excess of management's expectations.  A significant deterioration in the Company's ability to collect on accounts receivable could also impact the cost or availability of financing under its accounts receivable securitization program (see Financing Transactions appearing in Item 7 of this Report).The Company may not have adequate or cost-effective liquidity or capital resources.The Company's ability to satisfy its cash needs depends on its ability to generate cash from operations and to access the financial markets, both of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond the Company's control.The Company may need to satisfy its cash needs through external financing.  However, external financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.  As of June 29, 2013, Avnet had total debt outstanding of approximately $2.05 billion under various notes and committed and uncommitted lines of credit with financial institutions.  The Company needs cash to make interest payments on, and to refinance, this indebtedness and for general corporate purposes, such as funding its ongoing working capital and capital expenditure needs.  Under the terms of any external financing, the Company may incur higher than expected financing expenses and become subject to additional restrictions and covenants.  Any material increase in the Company's financing costs could have a material adverse effect on its profitability. Under certain of its credit facilities, the Company is required to maintain certain specified financial ratios and meet certain tests.  If the Company fails to meet these financial ratios and/or tests, it may be unable to continue to utilize these facilities.  If the Company is unable to utilize these facilities, it may not have sufficient cash available to make interest payments on and refinance indebtedness and for general corporate needs.  General economic or business conditions, domestic and foreign, may be less favorable than management expects and could adversely impact the Company's sales or its ability to collect receivables from its customers, which may impact access to the Company's securitization program.The agreements governing some of the Company's financings contain various covenants and restrictions that limit the discretion of management in operating its business and could prevent us from engaging in some activities that may be beneficial to the Company's business.The agreements governing the Company's financing, including its credit facility and the indentures governing the Company's outstanding notes, contain various covenants and restrictions that, in certain circumstances, limit the Company's ability, and the ability of certain subsidiaries, to:•grant liens on assets;•make restricted payments (including paying dividends on capital stock or redeeming or repurchasing capital stock);•make investments;•merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of the Company’s assets;•incur additional debt; or10Table of Contents•engage in certain transactions with affiliates.As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the Company may be limited in the future in how it conducts its business and may be unable to raise additional debt, compete effectively or make further investments.The Company may become involved in intellectual property disputes that could cause it to incur substantial costs, divert the efforts of management or require it to pay substantial damages or licensing fees.  From time to time, the Company receives notifications alleging infringements of intellectual property rights allegedly held by others relating to the Company's business or the products or services it sells.  Litigation with respect to patents or other intellectual property matters could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and other resources and could have an adverse effect on the Company's operations.  Further, the Company may be obligated to indemnify and defend its customers if the products or services the Company sells are alleged to infringe any third-party's intellectual property rights.  While the Company may be able to seek indemnification from its suppliers for itself and its customers against such claims, there is no assurance that it will be successful in obtaining such indemnification or that the Company will be fully protected against such claims.  If an infringement claim is successful, the Company may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.  The Company may have to stop selling certain products or services, which could affect its ability to compete effectively.  Failure to comply with the requirements of environmental regulations could adversely affect its business.The Company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, recycling of products at the end of their useful life and other related matters.  While the Company strives to ensure it is in full compliance with all applicable regulations, certain of these regulations impose liability without fault.  Additionally, the Company may be held responsible for the prior activities of an entity it acquired.  Failure to comply with these regulations could result in substantial costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury.  Further, environmental laws may become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations. Tax legislation initiatives or challenges to the Company's tax positions could impact the Company's results of operations and financial condition.As a multinational corporation, the Company is subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions.  From time to time, legislation may be enacted that could adversely affect the Company's tax positions.  There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate and the resulting cash flow will not be adversely affected by these potential changes in regulations.  The tax laws and regulations of the various countries where the Company has operations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations.  Although the Company believes that its historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that these tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that the Company would be successful in any such challenge. If the Company fails to maintain effective internal controls, it may not be able to report its financial results accurately or timely or prevent or detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business or the market price of the Company's securities.Effective internal controls are necessary for the Company to provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and to effectively prevent or detect fraud.  If the Company cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and effectively prevent or detect fraud, its brand and operating results could be harmed.  Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Company is required to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management's assessment of the effectiveness of such control.  Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud.  Therefore, even effective internal controls cannot provide absolute assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements.  In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  If the Company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the Company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the Company's business and operating results could be harmed, and the Company could fail to meet its reporting obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on its business or the market price of the Company's securities.11Table of Contents"

Forward-Looking Statements And Risk Factors
This Report contains forward-looking statements with respect to the financial condition, results of operations and business of Avnet.  These statements are generally identified by words like “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “should,” “will,” “may,” “estimates” or similar expressions.  Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties.Except as required by law, Avnet does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements include the following:Economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our results and prospects.The Company's results, operations and prospects depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions, the demand for its products and services, and the financial condition of its customers and suppliers.  Economic weakness and uncertainty, including the ongoing macroeconomic issues in many countries globally and the debt crisis in Europe and the United States, have in the past resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased revenues, margins and earnings.  Economic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for the Company to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables, which may result in reduced access to liquidity and higher financing costs.The electronics component and computer industries are highly competitive and if the Company fails to compete effectively, its revenues, gross profit margins and prospects may decline.The market for the Company's products and services is very competitive and subject to rapid technological advances, changes in industry standards and changes in customer needs.

Future downturns in the technology industry, particularly in the semiconductor sector, could negatively affect the Company's operating results and negatively impact the Company's ability to maintain its current profitability levels.Failure to maintain its relationships with key suppliers could adversely affect the Company’s sales.One of the Company's competitive strengths is the breadth and quality of the suppliers whose products the Company distributes.  However, sales of products and services from one of the Company's suppliers, IBM, accounted for approximately 11% of the Company's consolidated sales in fiscal year 2012.  Management expects IBM products and services to continue to account for roughly a similar percentage of the Company's consolidated sales in fiscal year 2013.  The Company's contracts with its suppliers, including those with IBM, vary in duration and are generally terminable by either party at will upon notice.  To the extent IBM or other primary suppliers significantly reduce their volume of business with the Company in the future, because of a product shortage, an unwillingness to do business with Avnet, or otherwise, the Company's business and relationships with its customers could be materially and adversely affected because its customers depend on the Company's distribution of electronic components and computer products from the industry's leading suppliers.  In addition, to the extent that any of the Company's key suppliers modify the terms of their contracts including, without limitation, the terms regarding price protection, rights of return, rebates or other terms that protect or enhance the Company's gross margins, it could materially and adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.Declines in the value of the Company's inventory or unexpected order cancellations by the Company's customers could materially and adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.The electronic components and computer products industries are subject to rapid technological change, new and enhanced products, changes in customer needs and changes in industry standards, which can contribute to a decline in value or obsolescence of inventory.  Regardless of the general economic environment, it is possible that prices will decline due to a decrease in demand or an oversupply of products and, as a result of the price declines, there may be greater risk of declines in inventory value.  Although it is the policy of many of the Company's suppliers to offer distributors like Avnet certain protections from the loss in value of inventory (such as price protection and limited rights of return), the Company cannot be assured that such policies will fully compensate for the loss in value, or that the vendors will choose to, or be able to, honor such agreements, some of which are not documented and, therefore, subject to the discretion of the vendor.  In addition, the Company's sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders, and the Company generally does not have long-term supply arrangements with its customers.  Generally, the Company's customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment with minimal penalties.  The Company cannot be assured that unforeseen new product developments, declines in the value of the Company's inventory or unforeseen order cancellations by its customers will not materially and adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.Substantial defaults by the Company's customers on its accounts receivable or the loss of significant customers could have a significant negative impact on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.A significant portion of the Company's working capital consists of accounts receivable from customers.  If customers responsible for a significant amount of accounts receivable were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay the amount it owes the Company, or were to become unwilling or unable to make such payments in a timely manner, the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected.  An economic or industry downturn could adversely and materially affect the servicing of these accounts receivable, which could result in longer payment cycles, increased collection costs and defaults in excess of management's expectations.  A significant deterioration in the Company's ability to collect on accounts receivable could also impact the cost or availability of financing under its accounts receivable securitization program (see Financing Transactions appearing in Item 7 of this Report).8Table of ContentsThe Company's non-U.S. locations represent a significant portion of its revenue, and consequently, the Company is increasingly exposed to risks associated with operating internationally.During fiscal year 2012, 2011 and 2010, approximately 61%, 62% and 60%, respectively, of the Company's sales came from its operations outside the United States.  As a result of the Company's foreign sales and locations, in particular those in emerging and developing economies, the Company's operations are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including, but not limited to, the following:•potential restrictions on the Company's ability to repatriate funds from its foreign subsidiaries;•foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations and the impact on the Company's reported results of operations;•import and export duties and value-added taxes; •compliance with foreign and domestic import and export regulations, business licensing requirements and anti-corruption laws, the failure of which could result in severe penalties including monetary fines, criminal proceedings and suspension of import or export privileges;•changing tax laws and regulations; •regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ between jurisdictions; •economic and political instability, terrorism and potential military conflicts or civilian unrest;•fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure;•natural disasters and health concerns; •differing environmental regulations and employment practices and labor issues; and•the risk of non-compliance with local laws. In addition to the cost of compliance, the potential criminal penalties for violations of export regulations and anti-corruption laws, particularly anti-bribery, data privacy laws and environmental laws and regulations in many jurisdictions, create heightened risks for the Company's international operations.  In the event that a governing regulatory body determined that the Company had violated applicable import or export regulations or anti-corruption laws, the Company could be fined significant sums, incur sizable legal defense costs and/or its import or export capabilities could be restricted, which could have a material and adverse effect on the Company's business.  While the Company has and will continue to adopt measures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, the Company cannot be assured that such measures will be adequate or that its business will not be materially and adversely impacted in the event of an alleged violation.The Company's acquisition strategy may not produce the expected benefits, which may adversely affect the Company's results of operations.Avnet has made, and expects to continue to make, strategic acquisitions or investments in companies around the world to further its strategic objectives and support key business initiatives.  Acquisitions and investments involve risks and uncertainties, some of which may differ from those associated with Avnet's historical operations.  The risks relating to such transactions include, but are not limited to, risks relating to expanding into emerging markets and business areas, adding additional product lines and services, incurring unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the companies acquired and diverting management's attention from existing business operations.  As a result, the Company's profitability may be negatively impacted.  In addition, the Company may not be successful in integrating the acquired businesses or the integration may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than anticipated.  Further, any litigation relating to a potential acquisition will result in an increase in the expenses associated with the acquisition or cause a delay in completing the acquisition, thereby impacting the Company's profitability.  The Company may experience disruptions that could, depending on the size of the acquisition, have a material adverse effect on its business, especially where an acquisition target may have pre-existing non-compliance or pre-existing deficiencies or material weaknesses as those terms are defined under relevant SEC rules and regulations.  Furthermore, the Company may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from its acquisitions, which could materially and adversely affect the Company's financial performance.9Table of ContentsIf the Company fails to maintain effective internal controls, it may not be able to report its financial results accurately or timely or detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business or the market price of the Company's securities.Effective internal controls are necessary for the Company to provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud.  If the Company cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, its brand and operating results could be harmed.  Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Company is required to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management's assessment of the effectiveness of such control.  Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud.  Therefore, even effective internal controls cannot provide absolute assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements.  In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  If the Company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the Company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the Company's business and operating results could be harmed, and the Company could fail to meet its reporting obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on its business or the market price of the Company's securities.If the Company’s internal information systems fail to function properly, or if the Company is unsuccessful in the integration or upgrade of information systems, its business operations could suffer.The Company's expanding operations put increasing pressure on the Company's information systems to facilitate the day- to- day operations of the business and to  produce timely, accurate and reliable reports on financial and operational results.  Currently, the Company's global operations are tracked with multiple information systems, some of which are subject to on-going IT projects designed to streamline or optimize its global information systems.  There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful at all times in these efforts or that there will not be integration difficulties that will adversely affect the Company's operations or the accurate and timely recording and reporting of financial data.  In addition, the Company's information technology is subject to security breaches, computer hacking or other general system failures.  Maintaining and operating these systems requires continuous investments.  A data privacy breach may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public.  A failure of any of these information systems in a way described above or material difficulties in upgrading these information systems could have material adverse effects on the Company's business and its compliance with reporting obligations under federal securities laws.Major disruptions to the Company’s logistics capability could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s operations.The Company's global logistics services are operated through specialized and centralized distribution centers around the globe.  The Company also depends almost entirely on third-party transportation service providers for the delivery of products to its customers.  A major interruption or disruption in service at one or more of its distribution centers for any reason (such as natural disasters, pandemics, or significant disruptions of services from our third-party providers) could cause cancellations or delays in a significant number of shipments to customers and, as a result, could have a severe impact on the Company's business, operations and financial performance.The Company may not have adequate or cost-effective liquidity or capital resources.The Company's ability to satisfy its cash needs depends on its ability to generate cash from operations and to access the financial markets, both of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond the Company's control.The Company may need to satisfy its cash needs through external financing.  However, external financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.  As of June 30, 2012, Avnet had total debt outstanding of $2.144 billion under various notes and committed and uncommitted lines of credit with financial institutions.  The Company needs cash to make interest payments on, and to refinance, this indebtedness and for general corporate purposes, such as funding its ongoing working capital and capital expenditure needs.  Under the terms of any external financing, the Company may incur higher than expected financing expenses and become subject to additional restrictions and covenants.  Any material increase in the Company's financing costs could have a material adverse effect on its profitability.10Table of ContentsUnder certain of its credit facilities, the Company is required to maintain certain specified financial ratios and meet certain tests.  If the Company fails to meet these financial ratios and/or tests, it may be unable to continue to utilize these facilities.  If the Company is unable to utilize these facilities, it may not have sufficient cash available to make interest payments on and refinance indebtedness and for general corporate needs.  General economic or business conditions, domestic and foreign, may be less favorable than management expects and could adversely impact the Company's sales or its ability to collect receivables from its customers, which may impact access to the Company's securitization program.The agreements governing some of the Company's financings contain various covenants and restrictions that limit the discretion of management in operating its business and could prevent us from engaging in some activities that may be beneficial to the Company's business.The agreements governing the Company's financing, including its credit facility and the indentures governing the Company's outstanding notes, contain various covenants and restrictions that, in certain circumstances, limit the Company's ability, and the ability of certain subsidiaries, to:•grant liens on assets;•make restricted payments (including paying dividends on capital stock or redeeming or repurchasing capital stock);•make investments;•merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of the Company’s assets;•incur additional debt; or•engage in certain transactions with affiliates.As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the Company may be limited in the future in how it conducts its business and may be unable to raise additional debt, compete effectively or make further investments.The Company may become involved in intellectual property disputes that could cause it to incur substantial costs, divert the efforts of management or require it to pay substantial damages or licensing fees.  From time to time, the Company receives notifications alleging infringements of intellectual property rights allegedly held by others relating to the Company's business or the products or services it sells.  Litigation with respect to patents or other intellectual property matters could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and other resources and could have an adverse effect on the Company's operations.  Further, the Company may be obligated to indemnify and defend its customers if the products or services the Company sells are alleged to infringe any third-party's intellectual property rights.  While the Company may be able to seek indemnification from its suppliers for itself and its customers against such claims, there is no assurance that it will be successful in obtaining such indemnification or that the Company will be fully protected against such claims.  If an infringement claim is successful, the Company may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.  The Company may have to stop selling certain products or services, which could affect its ability to compete effectively.  Failure to comply with the requirements of environmental regulations could adversely affect its business.The Company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, recycling of products at the end of their useful life and other related matters.  While the Company strives to ensure it is in full compliance with all applicable regulations, certain of these regulations impose liability without fault.  Additionally, the Company may be held responsible for the prior activities of an entity it acquired.  Failure to comply with these regulations could result in substantial costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury.  Further, environmental laws may become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violation. 11Table of ContentsTax legislation initiatives or challenges to the Company's tax positions could impact the Company's results of operations and financial condition.As a multinational corporation, the Company is subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions.  From time-to-time, legislation may be enacted that could adversely affect the Company's tax positions.  There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate and the resulting cash flow will not be adversely affected by these changes in regulations.  The tax laws and regulations of the various countries where the Company has operations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations.  Although the Company believes that its historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that these tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that the Company would be successful in any such challenge"

Forward-Looking Statements And Risk Factors
This Report contains forward-looking statements with respect to the financial condition,results of operations and business of Avnet. These statements are generally identified by wordslike believes, expects, anticipates, should, will, may, estimates or similarexpressions. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks anduncertainties. 7Table of ContentsExcept as required by law, Avnet does not undertake any obligation to update anyforward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in theforward-looking statements include the following:Economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenues and gross margins.The Companys revenues and gross profit margins depend significantly on worldwide economicconditions, the demand for its products and services and the financial condition of its customers.Economic weakness and uncertainty have in the past resulted, and may result in the future, indecreased revenues and gross profit margins. Economic weakness and uncertainty also make it moredifficult for the Company to forecast with a great deal of confidence the overall supply and demandthroughout the IT supply chain.While the Companys operating results over the past four quarters would suggest that thebusiness has experienced a significant recovery, there can be no assurance that the recovery todate will continue at the current pace or at all; nor can there be any assurance that such economicvolatility experienced recently will not reoccur or continue.The electronics component and computer industries are highly competitive and if the Company failsto compete effectively, its revenues, gross profit margins and prospects may decline.The market for the Companys products and services is very competitive and subject to rapidtechnological advances. Not only does the Company compete with other global distributors, it alsocompetes for customers with regional distributors and some of the Companys own suppliers. TheCompanys failure to maintain and enhance its competitive position could adversely affect itsbusiness and prospects. Furthermore, the Companys efforts to compete in the marketplace couldcause deterioration of gross profit margins and, thus, overall profitability.The size of the Companys competitors vary across market sectors, as do the resources theCompany has allocated to the sectors and geographic areas in which it does business. Therefore,some of the competitors may have greater financial, personnel, capacity and other resources or amore extensive customer base than the Company has in one or more of its market sectors andgeographic areas.An industry down-cycle in semiconductors could significantly affect the Companys operating resultsas a large portion of revenues comes from sales of semiconductors, which is a highly cyclicalindustry.The semiconductor industry historically has experienced periodic fluctuations in productsupply and demand, often associated with changes in technology and manufacturing capacity, and isgenerally considered to be highly cyclical. During each of the last three fiscal years, sales ofsemiconductors represented over 50% of the Companys consolidated sales, and the Companysrevenues, particularly those of EM, closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductormarket. Future downturns in the technology industry, particularly in the semiconductor sector,could negatively affect the Companys operating results and negatively impact the Companys abilityto maintain its current profitability levels.Failure to maintain its relationships with key suppliers could adversely affect the Companyssales.One of the Companys competitive strengths is the breadth and quality of the suppliers whoseproducts the Company distributes. However, sales of products and services from one of the Companyssuppliers, IBM, accounted for approximately 12% of the Companys consolidated sales in fiscal year2011. Management expects IBM products and services to continue to account for roughly a similarpercentage of the Companys consolidated sales in fiscal year 2012. The Companys contracts withits suppliers, including those with IBM, vary in duration and are generally terminable by eitherparty at will upon notice. To the extent IBM or other primary suppliers significantly reduce theirvolume of business with the Company in the future, because of a product shortage, an unwillingnessto do business with Avnet or otherwise, the Companys business and relationships with its customerscould be materially and adversely affected because its customers depend on the Companysdistribution of electronic components and computer products from the industrys leading suppliers.In addition, to the extent that any of the Companys key suppliers modify the terms of theircontracts including, without limitation, the terms regarding price protection, rights of return,rebates or other terms that protect the Companys gross margins, it could materially and adverselyaffect the Companys results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 8Table of ContentsDeclines in the value of the Companys inventory or unexpected order cancellations by the Companyscustomers could materially and adversely affect its business, results of operations, financialcondition and liquidity.The electronic components and computer products industries are subject to rapid technologicalchange, new and enhanced products and evolving industry standards, which can contribute to adecline in value or obsolescence of inventory. Regardless of the general economic environment, itis possible that prices will decline due to a decrease in demand or an oversupply of products and,as a result of the price declines, there may be greater risk of declines in inventory value.Although it is the policy of many of the Companys suppliers to offer distributors like Avnetcertain protections from the loss in value of inventory (such as price protection and limitedrights of return), the Company cannot be assured that such policies will fully compensate for theloss in value, or that the vendors will choose to, or be able to, honor such agreements, some ofwhich are not documented and, therefore, subject to the discretion of the vendor. In addition, theCompanys sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders, and the Companygenerally does not have long-term supply arrangements with its customers. Generally, the Companyscustomers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment with minimal penalties. The Company cannot beassured that unforeseen new product developments, declines in the value of the Companys inventoryor unforeseen order cancellations by its customers will not materially and adversely affect theCompanys business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.Substantial defaults by the Companys customers on its accounts receivable or the loss ofsignificant customers could have a significant negative impact on the Companys business, resultsof operations, financial condition or liquidity.A significant portion of the Companys working capital consists of accounts receivable fromcustomers. If customers responsible for a significant amount of accounts receivable were to becomeinsolvent or otherwise unable to pay for products and services, or were to become unwilling orunable to make payments in a timely manner, the Companys business, results of operations,financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected. An economic or industry downturncould adversely and materially affect the servicing of these accounts receivable, which couldresult in longer payment cycles, increased collection costs and defaults in excess of managementsexpectations. A significant deterioration in the Companys ability to collect on accountsreceivable could also impact the cost or availability of financing under its accounts receivablesecuritization program (see Financing Transactions appearing in Item 7 of this Report).The Companys non-U.S. locations represent a significant and growing portion of its revenue, andconsequently, the Company is increasingly exposed to risks associated with operatinginternationally.During fiscal year 2011, 2010 and 2009, approximately 62%, 60% and 58%, respectively, of theCompanys sales came from its operations outside the United States. As a result of the Companysforeign sales and locations, in particular those in emerging and developing economies, theCompanys operations are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to internationaloperations, including, but not limited to, the following:  potential restrictions on the Companys ability to repatriate funds from its foreignsubsidiaries;  foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations and the impact on the Companys reportedresults of operations;  import and export duties and value-added taxes;  compliance with foreign and domestic import and export regulations, business licensingrequirements and anti-corruption laws, the failure of which could result in severe penaltiesincluding monetary fines, criminal proceedings and suspension of export privileges;  changing tax laws and regulations;  regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ between jurisdictions;  political instability, terrorism and potential military conflicts or civilian unrest;  fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and otherdisruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure;  differing environmental regulations and employment practices and labor issues; and   the risk of non-compliance with local laws. 9Table of ContentsThe potential criminal penalties for violations of export regulations and anti-corruptionlaws, particularly anti-bribery, data privacy laws and environmental laws and regulations in manyjurisdictions, create heightened risks for the Companys international operations. In the eventthat a governing regulatory body determined that the Company had violated applicable exportregulations or anti-corruption laws, the Company could be fined significant sums, incur sizablelegal defense costs and/or its export capabilities could be restricted, which could have a materialand adverse effect on the Companys business. While the Company has and will continue to adoptmeasures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, the Company cannot be assured that suchmeasures will be adequate or that its business will not be materially and adversely impacted in theevent of an alleged violation.The Companys acquisition strategy may not produce the expected benefits, which may adverselyaffect the Companys results of operations.Avnet historically has pursued a strategic acquisition program to grow its global business forelectronic and computer products, thereby enabling Avnet to solidify and maintain its leadershipposition in the marketplace. Acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties such as expansion intonew geographic markets and business areas and diversion of managements attention from existingbusiness operations. In addition, the Company may not be successful in integrating the acquiredbusinesses or the integration may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than anticipated.Consequently, the Company may experience disruptions that could, depending on the size of theacquisition, have a material adverse effect on its business, especially where an acquisition targetmay have pre-existing non-compliance or pre-existing deficiencies or material weaknesses as thoseterms are defined under relevant SEC rules and regulations. Furthermore, the Company may notrealize all of the anticipated benefits from its acquisitions, which could materially and adverselyaffect the Companys financial performance.If the Company fails to maintain effective internal controls, it may not be able to report itsfinancial results accurately or timely or detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effecton the Companys business or stock price.Effective internal controls are necessary for the Company to provide reasonable assurance withrespect to its financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. If the Company cannot providereasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, its brandand operating results could be harmed. Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Company isrequired to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, includingmanagements assessment of the effectiveness of such control. Internal control over financialreporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, includingthe possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore,even effective internal controls cannot provide absolute assurance with respect to the preparationand fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to therisk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree ofcompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If the Company fails to maintain theadequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improvedcontrols, or if the Company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the Companysbusiness and operating results could be harmed, and the Company could fail to meet its reportingobligations, which could have a material adverse effect on its business and the market price of theCompanys securities.If the Companys internal information systems fail to function properly, or if the Company isunsuccessful in the integration or upgrade of information systems, its business operations couldsuffer.The Companys expanding operations put increasing pressure on the Companys informationsystems to produce timely, accurate and reliable reports on financial and operational results.Currently, the Companys global operations are tracked with multiple information systems, some ofwhich are subject to on-going IT projects designed to streamline or optimize its global informationsystems. There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful at all times in these efforts orthat there will not be integration difficulties that will adversely affect the Companys operationsor the accurate and timely recording and reporting of financial data. In addition, these systemsare subject to computer hacking or other general system failure. Maintaining and operating thesesystems requires continuous investments. Failure of any of these information systems or materialdifficulties in upgrading these information systems could have material adverse effects on theCompanys business and its compliance with reporting obligations under federal securities laws. 10Table of ContentsMajor disruptions to the Companys logistics capability could have a material adverse impact on theCompanys operations.The Companys global logistics services are operated through specialized and centralizeddistribution centers around the globe. The Company also depends almost entirely on third partytransportation service providers for the delivery of products to its customers. A majorinterruption or disruption in service at one or more of our distribution centers for any reason(such as natural disasters, pandemics, or significant disruptions of services from our third partyproviders) could cause cancellations or delays in a significant number of shipments to customersand, as a result, could have a severe impact on the Companys business, operations and financialperformance.The Company may not have adequate or cost-effective liquidity or capital resources.The Companys ability to satisfy its cash needs depends on its ability to generate cash fromoperations and to access the financial markets, both of which are subject to general economic,financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond the Companyscontrol.The Company may need to satisfy its cash needs through external financing. However, externalfinancing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. As of July 2, 2011, Avnet had totaldebt outstanding of $1.517 billion under various notes and committed and uncommitted lines ofcredit with financial institutions. The Company needs cash to make interest payments on, and torefinance, this indebtedness and for general corporate purposes, such as funding its ongoingworking capital and capital expenditure needs. Under the terms of any external financing, theCompany may incur higher than expected financing expenses and become subject to additionalrestrictions and covenants.

Factors that may cause actual results todiffer materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements include the following:Uncertainties in the current global economic recovery make it very difficult to forecast with agreat deal of confidence the overall supply and demand throughout the IT supply chain.The recent financial- and credit-induced global economic downturn had significant negativeimpact on the Companys financial results as Avnet experienced a rapid decline in end-market demandduring the later part of fiscal 2008 and during fiscal 2009, first in its Technology Solutionsoperating group and then in its Electronics Marketing operating group. The Companys operatingresults over the past three quarters would suggest that the business has experienced a significantrecovery, much faster than had been expected. However, there can be no assurance that the recoveryto date will continue at the current pace or at all; nor can there be any assurance that sucheconomic volatility experienced over the past two years will not reoccur or continue.The electronics component and computer industries are highly competitive and if the Company failsto compete effectively, its revenues may decline.The market for the Companys products and services is very competitive and subject to rapidtechnological advances.

However, sales of products and services from one of the Companyssuppliers, IBM, accounted for approximately 15% of the Companys consolidated sales in fiscal year2010. Management expects IBM products and services to continue to account for roughly a similarpercentage of the Companys consolidated sales in fiscal year 2011. The Companys contracts withits suppliers, including those with IBM, vary in duration and are generally terminable by eitherparty at will upon notice.

Risks and uncertainties are inherent in the merger and acquisitionprocess in that such activities may, among other things, divert managements attention fromexisting business operations. In addition, the Company may not be successful in integrating theacquired businesses or the integration may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming thananticipated. Consequently, the Company may experience disruptions that could, depending on the sizeof the acquisition, have a material adverse effect on its business, especially where an acquisitiontarget may have pre-existing non-compliance or pre-existing deficiencies or material weaknesses asthose terms are defined under relevant SEC rules and regulations.

As of July 3, 2010, Avnet had totaldebt outstanding of $1,280.2 million under various notes and committed and uncommitted lines ofcredit with financial institutions. The Company needs cash to make interest payments on, and torefinance, this indebtedness and for general corporate purposes, such as funding its ongoingworking capital and capital expenditure needs. Under the terms of any external financing, theCompany may incur higher than expected financing expenses and become subject to additionalrestrictions and covenants. Any material increase in the Companys financing costs could have amaterial adverse effect on its profitability.Under some of its credit facilities, the Company is required to maintain certain specifiedfinancial ratios and meet certain tests. If the Company fails to meet these financial ratios andtests, it may be unable to continue to utilize these facilities. If the Company could not continueto utilize these facilities, it may not have sufficient cash available to make interest payments onand refinance indebtedness and for general corporate needs.The agreements governing some of the Companys financings contain various covenants andrestrictions that limit the discretion of management in operating its business and could preventus from engaging in some activities that may be beneficial to the Companys business.The agreements governing the Companys financing, including its five-year, $500 million creditfacility and the indentures governing the Companys outstanding notes, contain various covenantsand restrictions that, in certain circumstances, limit the Companys ability and the ability ofcertain subsidiaries to:  grant liens on assets;   make restricted payments (including paying dividends on capital stock or redeeming orrepurchasing capital stock);   make investments;   merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of the Companys assets;   incur additional debt; or   engage in certain transactions with affiliates.As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the Company may be limited in the future inhow it conducts its business and may be unable to raise additional debt, compete effectively ormake further investments. 11Table of ContentsIn addition to the specific factors described above, general economic or business conditions,domestic and foreign, may be less favorable than management expected and, if such conditionspersist for a sustained period of time, could eventually adversely impact the Companys sales orits ability to collect receivables from some of its customers"
7,AVT,AVNET INC,2009-08-25,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors Forward-Looking    Statements And Risk Factors
     This Report contains forward-looking statements with respect to    the financial condition, results of operations and business of    Avnet. These statements are generally identified by words like    believes, expects,    anticipates, should, will,    may, estimates or similar expressions.    Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions,    risks and uncertainties.     Avnet does not undertake any obligation to update any    forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new    information, future events or otherwise. Factors that may cause    actual results to differ materially from those contained in the    forward-looking statements include the following: The    current global economic downturn has affected the Companys    financial results and management can offer no assurance that the    effect of these conditions either will improve in the near    future or will not worsen.     Beginning with the third quarter of fiscal 2008, the    Companys financial results were impacted negatively by the    global economic slowdown as Avnet experienced a rapid decline in    end market demand, first in its Technology Solutions operating    group and then in its Electronics Marketing operating group.    Deterioration in the financial and credit markets heighten the    risk of reduced corporate spending on information technology,    and continued market weakness may result in a more competitive    environment and lower sales. Even though management takes action    to better align the Companys cost structure with current    market conditions, the benefits from these cost reductions may    take longer to fully realize or otherwise may not fully mitigate    the impact of the reduced demand in the technology supply chain. An    industry down-cycle in semiconductors could significantly affect    the Companys operating results as a large portion of    revenues comes from sales of semiconductors, which has been a    highly cyclical industry.     The semiconductor industry historically has experienced periodic    fluctuations in product supply and demand, often associated with    changes in technology and manufacturing capacity, and is    generally considered to be highly cyclical. During each of the    last three fiscal years, sales of semiconductors represented    over 50% of the Companys consolidated sales, and the    Companys revenues, particularly those of EM, closely    follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor market.    Future downturns in the technology industry, particularly in the    semiconductor sector, could negatively affect the Companys    operating results and negatively impact the Companys    ability to maintain its current profitability levels. Failure    to maintain its relationships with key suppliers could adversely    affect the Companys sales.     One of the Companys competitive strengths is the breadth    and quality of the suppliers whose products the Company    distributes. However, sales of products and services from one of    the Companys suppliers, IBM, accounted for approximately    15% of the Companys consolidated sales in fiscal year    2009. Management expects IBM products and services to continue    to account for roughly a similar percentage of the    Companys consolidated sales in fiscal year 2010. The    Companys contracts with its suppliers, including those    with IBM, vary in duration and are generally terminable by    either party at will upon notice. To the extent IBM or other    primary suppliers significantly reduce their volume of business    with the Company in the future, the Companys business and    relationships with its customers could be materially, adversely    affected because its customers depend on the Companys    distribution of electronic components and computer products from    the industrys leading suppliers. In addition, to the    extent that any of the Companys key suppliers modify the    terms of their contracts including, without limitation, the    terms regarding price protection, rights of return, rebates or    other terms that protect the Companys gross margins, it    could materially and adversely affect the Companys results    of operations, financial condition or liquidity.    8Table of ContentsDeclines    in the value of the Companys inventory or unexpected order    cancellations by the Companys customers could materially,    adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial    condition or liquidity.     The electronic components and computer products industries are    subject to rapid technological change, new and enhanced products    and evolving industry standards, which can contribute to a    decline in value or obsolescence of inventory. During an    industry    and/or    economic downturn, it is possible that prices will decline due    to an oversupply of products and, as a result of the price    declines, there may be greater risk of declines in inventory    value. Although it is the policy of many of the Companys    suppliers to offer distributors like Avnet certain protections    from the loss in value of inventory (such as price protection    and limited rights of return), the Company cannot be assured    that such policies will fully compensate for the loss in value,    or that the vendors will choose to, or be able to, honor such    agreements, some of which are not documented and therefore    subject to the discretion of the vendor. In addition, the    Companys sales are typically made pursuant to individual    purchase orders, and the Company generally does not have    long-term supply arrangements with its customers. Generally, the    Companys customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to    shipment with minimal penalties. The Company cannot be assured    that unforeseen new product developments, declines in the value    of the Companys inventory or unforeseen order    cancellations by its customers will not materially and adversely    affect the Companys business, results of operations,    financial condition or liquidity. Substantial    defaults by the Companys customers on its accounts    receivable or the loss of significant customers could have a    significant negative impact on the Companys business,    results of operations, financial condition or    liquidity.     A significant portion of the Companys working capital    consists of accounts receivable from customers. If customers    responsible for a significant amount of accounts receivable were    to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay for products and    services, or were to become unwilling or unable to make payments    in a timely manner, the Companys business, results of    operations, financial condition or liquidity could be adversely    affected. An economic or industry downturn could adversely and    materially affect the servicing of these accounts receivable,    which could result in longer payment cycles, increased    collection costs and defaults in excess of managements    expectations. A significant deterioration in the Companys    ability to collect on accounts receivable could also impact the    cost or availability of financing under its accounts receivable    securitization program (see Financing Transactions appearing in    Item 7 of this Report). The    electronics component and computer industries are highly    competitive and if the Company cannot effectively compete, its    revenues may decline.     The market for the Companys products and services is very    competitive and subject to rapid technological advances. Not    only does the Company compete with other global distributors, it    also competes for customers with regional distributors and some    of the Companys own suppliers. The Companys failure    to maintain and enhance its competitive position could adversely    affect its business and prospects. Furthermore, the    Companys efforts to compete in the marketplace could cause    deterioration of gross profit margins and, thus, overall    profitability.     The sizes of the Companys competitors vary across market    sectors, as do the resources the Company has allocated to the    sectors in which it does business. Therefore, some of the    competitors may have greater financial, personnel, capacity and    other resources or a more extensive customer base than the    Company has in one or more of its market sectors. The    Companys    non-U.S.    locations represent a significant and growing portion of its    revenue, and consequently, the Company is increasingly exposed    to risks associated with operating    internationally.     During fiscal year 2009, 2008 and 2007, approximately 53%, 52%    and 50%, respectively, of the Companys sales came from its    operations outside the United States. As a result of the    Companys foreign sales and locations, those in emerging    and developing economies in particular, the Companys    operations are subject to a variety of risks that are specific    to international operations, including, but not limited to, the    following:           potential restrictions on the Companys ability to    repatriate funds from its foreign subsidiaries;    9Table of Contents           foreign currency fluctuations and the impact on the    Companys reported results of operations of the translation    of the foreign currencies to U.S. dollars;           import and export duties and value-added taxes;           compliance with foreign and domestic import and export    regulations and anti-corruption laws, the failure of which could    result in severe penalties including monetary fines, criminal    proceedings and suspension of export privileges;           changing tax laws and regulations;           political instability, terrorism and potential military    conflicts;           inflexible employee contracts in the event of business    downturns; and           the risk of non-compliance with local laws.     The potential criminal penalties for violations of export    regulations and anti-corruption laws, particularly the    U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, create heightened risks    for the Companys international operations. In the event    that a governing regulatory body determined that the Company had    violated applicable export regulations or anti-corruption laws,    the Company could be fined significant sums, incur sizable legal    defense costs    and/or its    export capabilities could be restricted, which could have a    material adverse effect on the Companys business. While    the Company has and will continue to adopt measures designed to    ensure compliance with these laws, the Company cannot be assured    that such measures will be adequate or that its business will    not be materially impacted in the event of an alleged violation. The    Companys acquisition strategy may not produce the expected    benefits, which may adversely affect the Companys results    of operations.     Avnet historically has pursued a strategic acquisition program    to grow its global markets for electronic and computer products.    That program has enabled Avnet to solidify and maintain its    leadership position in the marketplace. During fiscal 2009,    Avnet completed five acquisitions. Risks and uncertainties are    inherent in the mergers and acquisition process in that such    activities may divert managements attention from existing    business operations. In addition, the Company may not be    successful in integrating the acquired businesses or the    integration may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than    anticipated. Consequently, the Company may experience    disruptions that could, depending on the size of the    acquisition, have a material adverse effect on its business.    Furthermore, the Company may not realize all of the anticipated    benefits from its acquisitions, which could adversely affect the    Companys financial performance. If the    Company fails to maintain effective internal controls, it may    not be able to report its financial results accurately or timely    or detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on    the Companys business or stock price.     Effective internal controls are necessary for the Company to    provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial    reports and to effectively prevent fraud. If the Company cannot    provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial    reports and effectively prevent fraud, its brand and operating    results could be harmed. Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of    2002, the Company is required to furnish a report by management    on internal control over financial reporting, including    managements assessment of the effectiveness of such    control. Internal control over financial reporting may not    prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent    limitations, including the possibility of human error, the    circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore,    even effective internal controls cannot provide absolute    assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation    of financial statements. In addition, projections of any    evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial    reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the    control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,    or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures    may deteriorate. If the Company fails to maintain the adequacy    of its internal controls, including any failure to implement    required new or improved controls, or if the Company experiences    difficulties in their implementation, the Companys    business and operating results could be harmed, and the Company    could fail to meet its reporting obligations, which could have a    material adverse effect on its business and the share price.    10Table of ContentsIf the    Companys internal information systems fail to function    properly, or if the Company is unsuccessful in the integration    or upgrade of information systems, its business operations could    suffer.     The Companys expanding operations put increasing reliance    on the Companys internal information systems in producing    timely, accurate and reliable reports on financial and    operational results. Currently, the Companys global    operations are tracked with multiple internal information    systems, some of which are subject to on-going IT projects    designed to streamline or optimize its global information    systems. There is no guarantee that the Company will be    successful at all times or that there will not be integration    difficulties that will adversely affect the Companys    operations or the accurate recording and reporting of financial    data. In addition, these systems are subject to computer hacking    or other general system failure. Maintaining and operating these    systems requires continuous investments. Failure of any of these    internal information systems or material difficulties in    upgrading these information systems could have material adverse    effects on the Companys business and its compliance with    securities laws. Major    disruptions to the Companys logistics capability could    have a material adverse impact on the Companys    operations.     The Companys global logistics services are operated    through specialized and centralized distribution centers around    the globe. The Company also depends almost entirely on third    party transportation service providers for the delivery of    products to its customers. A major interruption or disruption in    service at one or more of our distribution centers for any    reason (such as natural disasters, pandemics, or significant    disruptions of services from our third party providers) could    cause cancellations or delays in a significant number of    shipments to customers and, as a result, could have a severe    impact on the Companys business, operations and financial    performance. The    Company may not have adequate or cost-effective liquidity or    capital resources.     The Companys ability to satisfy its cash needs depends on    its ability to generate cash from operations and to access the    financial markets, both of which are subject to general    economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and    other factors that are beyond the Companys control.     The Company may need to satisfy its cash needs through external    financing. However, external financing may not be available on    acceptable terms or at all. As of June 27, 2009, Avnet had    total debt outstanding of $969.9 million under various    notes and committed and uncommitted lines of credit with    financial institutions. The Company needs cash to make interest    payments on, and to refinance, this indebtedness and for general    corporate purposes, such as funding its ongoing working capital    and capital expenditure needs. Under the terms of any external    financing, the Company may incur higher than expected financing    expenses and become subject to additional restrictions and    covenants. Any material increase in the Companys financing    costs could have a material adverse effect on its profitability.     Under some of its various credit facilities, the Company is    required to maintain certain specified financial ratios and meet    certain tests. If the Company fails to meet these financial    ratios and tests, it may be unable to continue to utilize these    facilities. If the Company could not continue to utilize these    facilities, it may not have sufficient cash available to make    interest payments on and refinance indebtedness and for general    corporate needs. The    agreements governing some of the Companys financings    contain various covenants and restrictions that limit the    discretion of management in operating its business and could    prevent us from engaging in some activities that may be    beneficial to the Companys business.     The agreements governing the Companys financing, including    its five-year, $500 million credit facility and the    indentures governing the Companys outstanding notes,    contain various covenants and restrictions that, in certain    circumstances, limit the Companys ability and the ability    of certain subsidiaries to:           grant liens on assets;           make restricted payments (including paying dividends on capital    stock or redeeming or repurchasing capital stock);           make investments;           merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of the    Companys assets;    11Table of Contents           incur additional debt; or           engage in certain transactions with affiliates.     As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the Company may    be limited in the future in how it conducts its business and may    be unable to raise additional debt, compete effectively or make    further investments.     In addition to the specific factors described above, general    economic or business conditions, domestic and foreign, may be    less favorable than management expected and, if such conditions    persist in a sustained period of time, could eventually    adversely impact the Companys sales or the Companys    ability to collect receivables from some of its customers. "

     This Report contains forward-looking statements with respect to    the financial condition, results of operations and business of    Avnet. These statements are generally identified by words like    believes, expects,    anticipates, should, will,    may, estimates or similar expressions.    Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions,    risks and uncertainties.     Avnet does not undertake any obligation to update any    forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new    information, future events or otherwise. Factors that may cause    actual results to differ materially from those contained in the    forward-looking statements include the following: An    industry down-cycle in semiconductors could significantly affect    the Companys operating results as a large portion of our    revenues comes from sales of semiconductors, which has been a    highly cyclical industry.     The semiconductor industry historically has experienced periodic    fluctuations in product supply and demand, often associated with    changes in technology and manufacturing capacity, and is    generally considered to be highly cyclical. During each of the    last three fiscal years, sales of semiconductors represented    over 50% of the Companys consolidated sales, and the    Companys revenues, particularly those of EM, closely    follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor market.    While the semiconductor industry has strengthened recently as    compared with the downturn experienced in 2001 and 2002 and    industry cycles appear less volatile, it is uncertain whether    this trend will continue. Future downturns in the technology    industry, particularly in the semiconductor sector, could    negatively affect the Companys operating results and    negatively impact the Companys ability to maintain its    current profitability levels. Failure    to maintain its relationships with key suppliers could adversely    affect the Companys sales.     One of the Companys competitive strengths is the breadth    and quality of the suppliers whose products the Company    distributes. However, sales of products and services from one of    the Companys suppliers, IBM, accounted for approximately    14% of the Companys consolidated sales in fiscal year    2008. Management expects    8Table of Contents    IBM products and services to continue to account for over 10% of    the Companys consolidated sales in fiscal year 2009. The    Companys contracts with its suppliers, including those    with IBM, vary in duration and are generally terminable by    either party at will upon notice. To the extent IBM or a group    of other primary suppliers is not willing to do business with    the Company in the future, the Companys business and    relationships with its customers could be materially and    adversely affected because its customers depend on the    Companys distribution of electronic components and    computer products from the industrys leading suppliers. In    addition, to the extent that any of the Companys key    suppliers modifies the terms of their contracts including,    without limitation, the terms regarding price protection, rights    of return, rebates or other terms that protect the    Companys gross margins, it could materially and adversely    affect the Companys results of operations, financial    condition or liquidity. Declines    in the value of the Companys inventory or unexpected order    cancellations by the Companys customers could materially,    adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial    condition or liquidity.     The electronic components and computer products industries are    subject to rapid technological change, new and enhanced products    and evolving industry standards, which can contribute to a    decline in value or obsolescence of inventory. During an    industry    and/or    economic downturn, it is possible that prices will decline due    to an oversupply of products and, as a result of the price    declines, there may be greater risk of declines in inventory    value. Although it is the policy of many of the Companys    suppliers to offer distributors like Avnet certain protections    from the loss in value of inventory (such as price protection,    limited rights of return and rebates), the Company cannot be    assured that such return policies and rebates will fully    compensate us for the loss in value, or that the vendors will    choose to, or be able to, honor such agreements, some of which    are not documented and therefore subject to the discretion of    the vendor. In addition, the Companys sales are typically    made pursuant to individual purchase orders, and the Company    generally does not have long-term supply arrangements with its    customers. Generally, the Companys customers may cancel    orders 30 days prior to shipment with minimal penalties.    The Company cannot be assured that unforeseen new product    developments, declines in the value of the Companys    inventory or unforeseen order cancellations by its customers    will not materially and adversely affect the Companys    business, results of operations, financial condition or    liquidity, or that the Company will successfully manage its    existing and future inventories. Substantial    defaults by the Companys customers on its accounts    receivable or the loss of significant customers could have a    significant negative impact on the Companys business,    results of operations, financial condition or    liquidity.     A significant portion of the Companys working capital    consists of accounts receivable from customers. If customers    responsible for a significant amount of accounts receivable were    to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay for products and    services, or were to become unwilling or unable to make payments    in a timely manner, the Companys business, results of    operations, financial condition or liquidity could be adversely    affected. An economic or industry downturn could adversely and    materially affect the servicing of these accounts receivable,    which could result in longer payment cycles, increased    collection costs and defaults in excess of managements    expectations. A significant deterioration in the Companys    ability to collect on accounts receivable could also impact the    cost or availability of financing under its accounts receivable    securitization program (see Financing Transactions    appearing in Item 7 of this Report). The    electronics component and computer industries are highly    competitive and if the Company cannot effectively compete, its    revenues may decline.     The market for the Companys products and services is very    competitive and subject to rapid technological advances. Not    only does the Company compete with other global distributors, it    also competes for customers with regional distributors and some    of the Companys own suppliers. The Companys failure    to maintain and enhance its competitive position could adversely    affect its business and prospects. Furthermore, the    Companys efforts to compete in the marketplace could cause    deterioration of gross profit margins and, thus, overall    profitability.     The sizes of the Companys competitors vary across market    sectors, as do the resources the Company has allocated to the    sectors in which it does business. Therefore, some of the    competitors may have greater financial,    9Table of Contents    personnel, capacity and other resources or a more extensive    customer base than the Company has in one or more of its market    sectors. The    Companys    non-U.S.    locations represent a significant and growing portion of its    revenue, and consequently, the Company is increasingly exposed    to risks associated with operating    internationally.     During fiscal year 2008, 2007 and 2006, approximately 52%, 50%    and 49%, respectively, of the Companys sales came from its    operations outside the United States. Most notable in this    growth of    non-U.S. sales    is the increasing volume of sales activity in the Asia region,    which accounted for approximately 19% of consolidated sales    during fiscal year 2008. As a result of the Companys    foreign sales and locations, those in emerging and developing    economies in particular, the Companys operations are    subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international    operations, including, but not limited to, the following:           potential restrictions on the Companys ability to    repatriate funds from its foreign subsidiaries;           foreign currency fluctuations and the impact on the    Companys reported results of operations of the translation    of the foreign currencies to U.S. dollars;           import and export duties and value-added taxes;           compliance with foreign and domestic import and export    regulations and anti-corruption laws, the failure of which could    result in severe penalties including monetary fines, criminal    proceedings and suspension of export privileges;           changing tax laws and regulations;           political instability, terrorism and potential military    conflicts;           inflexible employee contracts in the event of business    downturns; and           the risk of non-compliance with local laws.     While the Company has and will continue to adopt measures to    reduce the impact of losses resulting from volatile currencies    and other risks of doing business abroad, the Company cannot be    assured that such measures will be adequate or that its    financial results will not be materially impacted as a result of    increased costs of doing business in those countries. The    Companys acquisition strategy may not produce the expected    benefits, which may adversely affect the Companys results    of operations.     Avnet historically has pursued a strategic acquisition program    to grow its global markets for electronic and computer products.    That program has enabled Avnet to solidify and maintain its    leadership position in the market place. During fiscal 2008 and    through the date of this filing, Avnet has completed ten    acquisitions. Risks and uncertainties are inherent in the    mergers and acquisition process in that such activities may    divert managements attention from existing business    operations. In addition, the Company may not be successful in    integrating the acquired businesses or the integration may be    more difficult, costly or time-consuming than anticipated.    Consequently, the Company may experience disruptions that could    have a material adverse effect on its business. Furthermore, the    Company may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from its    acquisitions, which could adversely affect the Companys    financial performance. If the    Company fails to maintain effective internal controls, it may    not be able to report its financial results accurately or timely    or detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on    the Companys business or stock price.     Effective internal controls are necessary for the Company to    provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial    reports and to effectively prevent fraud. If the Company cannot    provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial    reports and effectively prevent fraud, its brand and operating    results could be harmed. Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of    2002, the Company is required to furnish a report by management    on internal control over financial reporting, including    managements assessment of the effectiveness of such    control. Internal control over    10Table of Contents    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements    because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility    of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or    fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls cannot    provide absolute assurance with respect to the preparation and    fair presentation of financial statements. In addition,    projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal    control over financial reporting to future periods are subject    to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of    changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the    policies or procedures may deteriorate. If the Company fails to    maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any    failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if    the Company experiences difficulties in their implementation,    the Companys business and operating results could be    harmed, and the Company could fail to meet its reporting    obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on its    business and the share price. If the    Companys internal information systems fail to function    properly, or if the Company is unsuccessful in the integration    or upgrade of information systems, its business operations could    suffer.     The Companys expanding operations put increasing reliance    on the Companys internal information systems in producing    timely, accurate and reliable reports on financial and    operational results. Currently, the Companys global    operations are tracked with multiple internal information    systems, some of which are subject to on-going IT projects    designed to streamline or optimize its global information    systems. There is no guarantee that the Company will be    successful at all times or that there will not be integration    difficulties that will adversely affect the Companys    operations or the accurate recording and reporting of financial    data. In addition, these systems are subject to computer hacking    or other general system failure. Maintaining and operating these    systems requires continuous investments. Failure of any of these    internal information systems or material difficulties in    upgrading these information systems could have material adverse    effects on the Companys business and its compliance with    securities laws. Major    disruptions to the Companys logistics capability could    have a material adverse impact on the Companys    operations.     The Companys global logistics services are operated    through specialized and centralized distribution centers around    the globe. The Company also depends almost entirely on third    party transportation service providers for the delivery of    products to its customers. A major interruption or disruption in    service at one or more of our distribution centers for any    reason (such as natural disasters, pandemics, or significant    disruptions of services from our third party providers) could    cause cancellations or delays in a significant number of    shipments to customers and, as a result, could have a severe    impact on the Companys business, operations and financial    performance. The    Company may not have adequate or cost-effective liquidity or    capital resources.     The Companys ability to satisfy its cash needs depends on    its ability to generate cash from operations and to access the    financial markets, both of which are subject to general    economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and    other factors that are beyond the Companys control.     The Company may need to satisfy its cash needs through external    financing. However, external financing may not be available on    acceptable terms or at all. As of June 28, 2008, Avnet had    total debt outstanding of $1.23 billion under various notes    and committed and uncommitted lines of credit with financial    institutions. The Company needs cash to make interest payments    on, and to refinance, this indebtedness and for general    corporate purposes, such as funding its ongoing working capital    and capital expenditure needs. Under the terms of any external    financing, the Company may incur higher than expected financing    expenses and become subject to additional restrictions and    covenants. Any material increase in the Companys financing    costs could have a material adverse effect on its profitability.     Under some of its various credit facilities, the Company is    required to maintain certain specified financial ratios and meet    certain tests. If the Company fails to meet these financial    ratios and tests, it may be unable to continue to utilize these    facilities. If the Company could not continue to utilize these    facilities, it may not have sufficient cash available to make    interest payments on and refinance indebtedness and for general    corporate needs.    11Table of ContentsThe    agreements governing some of the Companys financings    contain various covenants and restrictions that limit the    discretion of management in operating its business and could    prevent us from engaging in some activities that may be    beneficial to the Companys business.     The agreements governing the Companys financing, including    its five-year, $500 million credit facility and the    indentures governing the Companys outstanding notes,    contain various covenants and restrictions that, in certain    circumstances, limit the Companys ability and the ability    of certain subsidiaries to:           grant liens on assets;           make restricted payments (including paying dividends on capital    stock or redeeming or repurchasing capital stock);           make investments;           merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of the    Companys assets;           incur additional debt; or           engage in certain transactions with affiliates.     As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the Company may    be limited in how it conducts its business and may be unable to    raise additional debt, compete effectively or make investments.     In addition to the specific factors described above, general    economic or business conditions, domestic and foreign, may be    less favorable than management expected and, if such conditions    persist in a sustained period of time, could eventually    adversely impact the Companys sales or the Companys    ability to collect receivables from some of its customers. "

     This Report contains forward-looking statements with respect to    the financial condition, results of operations and business of    Avnet. These statements are generally identified by words like    believes, expects,    anticipates, should, will,    may, estimates or similar expressions.    Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions,    risks and uncertainties.     Avnet does not undertake any obligation to update any    forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new    information, future events or otherwise.    8Table of Contents    Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from    those contained in the forward-looking statements include the    following: An    industry down-cycle in semiconductors could significantly affect    the Companys operating results as a large portion of our    revenues comes from sales of semiconductors, which has been a    highly cyclical industry.     The semiconductor industry historically has experienced periodic    fluctuations in product supply and demand, often associated with    changes in technology and manufacturing capacity, and is    generally considered to be highly cyclical. During each of the    last three fiscal years, sales of semiconductors represented    over 50% of the Companys consolidated sales, and the    Companys revenues, particularly those of EM, closely    follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor market.    While the semiconductor industry has strengthened recently as    compared with the downturn experienced in 2001 and 2002 and    industry cycles appear less volatile, it is uncertain whether    this trend will continue. Future downturns in the technology    industry, particularly in the semiconductor sector, could    negatively affect the Companys operating results and    negatively impact the Companys ability to maintain its    current profitability levels. Failure    to maintain its relationships with key suppliers could adversely    affect the Companys sales.     One of the Companys competitive strengths is the breadth    and quality of the suppliers whose products the Company    distributes. However, sales of products and services from one of    the Companys suppliers, IBM, accounted for approximately    14% of the Companys consolidated sales in fiscal year    2007. Management expects IBM products and services to continue    to account for over 10% of the Companys consolidated sales    in fiscal year 2008. The Companys contracts with its    suppliers, including those with IBM, vary in duration and are    generally terminable by either party at will upon notice. To the    extent IBM or a group of other primary suppliers is not willing    to do business with the Company in the future, the    Companys business and relationships with its customers    could be materially, adversely affected because its customers    depend on the Companys distribution of electronic    components and computer products from the industrys    leading suppliers. In addition, to the extent that any of the    Companys key suppliers modifies the terms of their    contracts including, without limitation, the terms regarding    price protection, rights of return, rebates or other terms that    protect the Companys gross margins, it could materially,    adversely affect the Companys results of operations,    financial condition or liquidity. The    Company may not have adequate or cost-effective liquidity or    capital resources.     The Companys ability to satisfy its cash needs depends on    its ability to generate cash from operations and to access the    financial markets, both of which are subject to general    economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and    other factors that are beyond the Companys control.     The Company may need to satisfy its cash needs through external    financing. However, external financing may not be available on    acceptable terms or at all. As of June 30, 2007, Avnet had    total debt outstanding of $1.21 billion under various notes    and committed and uncommitted lines of credit with financial    institutions. The Company needs cash to make interest payments    on, and to refinance, this indebtedness and for general    corporate purposes, such as funding its ongoing working capital    and capital expenditure needs. Under the terms of any external    financing, the Company may incur higher than expected financing    expenses and become subject to additional restrictions and    covenants. Any material increase in the Companys financing    costs could have a material adverse effect on its profitability.     Under some of its various credit facilities, the Company is    required to maintain certain specified financial ratios and meet    certain tests. If the Company fails to meet these financial    ratios and tests, it may be unable to continue to utilize these    facilities. If the Company could not continue to utilize these    facilities, it may not have sufficient cash available to make    interest payments on and refinance indebtedness and for general    corporate needs. Furthermore, disclosure of any such    non-compliance may contribute to increased volatility of the    Companys share price and thereby exposing the Company to    potential securities litigation.    9Table of ContentsThe    agreements governing some of the Companys financings    contain various covenants and restrictions that limit the    discretion of management in operating its business and could    prevent us from engaging in some activities that may be    beneficial to the Companys business.     The agreements governing the Companys financing, including    its five-year, $500 million credit facility and the    indentures governing the Companys outstanding notes,    contain various covenants and restrictions that, in certain    circumstances, limit the Companys ability and the ability    of certain subsidiaries to:           grant liens on assets;           make restricted payments (including paying dividends on capital    stock or redeeming or repurchasing capital stock);           make investments;           merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of the    Companys assets;           incur additional debt; or           engage in certain transactions with affiliates.     As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the Company may    be limited in how it conducts its business and may be unable to    raise additional debt, compete effectively or make investments. Declines    in the value of the Companys inventory or unexpected order    cancellations by the Companys customers could materially,    adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial    condition or liquidity.     The electronic components and computer products industries are    subject to rapid technological change, new and enhanced products    and evolving industry standards, which can contribute to a    decline in value or obsolescence of inventory. During an    industry    and/or    economic downturn, it is possible that prices will decline due    to an oversupply of products and, as a result of the price    declines, there may be greater risk of declines in inventory    value. Although it is the policy of many of the Companys    suppliers to offer distributors like Avnet certain protections    from the loss in value of inventory (such as price protection,    limited rights of return and rebates), the Company cannot be    assured that such return policies and rebates will fully    compensate us for the loss in value, or that the vendors will    choose to, or be able to, honor such agreements, some of which    are not documented and therefore subject to the discretion of    the vendor. In addition, the Companys sales are typically    made pursuant to individual purchase orders, and the Company    generally does not have long-term supply arrangements with its    customers. Generally, the Companys customers may cancel    orders 30 days prior to shipment with minimal penalties.    The Company cannot be assured that unforeseen new product    developments, declines in the value of the Companys    inventory or unforeseen order cancellations by its customers    will not materially, adversely affect the Companys    business, results of operations, financial condition or    liquidity, or that the Company will successfully manage its    existing and future inventories. Substantial    defaults by the Companys customers on its accounts    receivable or the loss of significant customers could have a    significant negative impact on the Companys business,    results of operations, financial condition or    liquidity.     A significant portion of the Companys working capital    consists of accounts receivable from customers. If customers    responsible for a significant amount of accounts receivable were    to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay for products and    services, or were to become unwilling or unable to make payments    in a timely manner, the Companys business, results of    operations, financial condition or liquidity could be adversely    affected. An economic or industry downturn could adversely and    materially affect the servicing of these accounts receivable,    which could result in longer payment cycles, increased    collection costs and defaults in excess of managements    expectations. A significant deterioration in the Companys    ability to collect on accounts receivable could also impact the    cost or availability of financing under its Securitization    Program.    10Table of ContentsThe    electronics component and computer industries are highly    competitive and if the Company cannot effectively compete, its    revenues may decline.     The market for the Companys products and services is very    competitive and subject to rapid technological advances. Not    only does the Company compete with other global distributors, it    also competes for customers with regional distributors and some    of the Companys own suppliers. The Companys failure    to maintain and enhance its competitive position could adversely    affect its business and prospects. Furthermore, the    Companys efforts to compete in the marketplace could cause    deterioration of gross profit margins and, thus, overall    profitability.     The sizes of the Companys competitors vary across market    sectors, as do the resources the Company has allocated to the    sectors in which it does business. Therefore, some of the    competitors may have greater financial, personnel, capacity and    other resources or a more extensive customer base than the    Company has in one or more of its market sectors. The    Companys    non-U.S.    locations represent a significant and growing portion of its    revenue, and consequently, the Company is increasingly exposed    to risks associated with operating    internationally.     During fiscal year 2007, 2006 and 2005, approximately 50%, 49%    and 48%, respectively, of the Companys sales came from its    operations outside the United States. Most notable in this    growth of    non-U.S. sales    is the increasing volume of sales activity in the Asia region,    which accounted for approximately 19% of consolidated sales    during fiscal year 2007. As a result of the Companys    foreign sales and locations, its operations are subject to a    variety of risks that are specific to international operations,    including, but not limited to, the following:           potential restrictions on the Companys ability to    repatriate funds from its foreign subsidiaries;           foreign currency fluctuations and the impact on the    Companys reported results of operations of the translation    of the foreign currencies to U.S. dollars;           import and export duties and value-added taxes;           import and export regulation changes;           changing foreign tax laws and regulations;           political instability, terrorism and potential military    conflicts;           inflexible employee contracts in the event of business    downturns; and           the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws.     The Company has operations in several locations in emerging or    developing economies that have a potential for higher risk. The    risks associated with these economies include currency    volatility and other economic or political risks. While the    Company has and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the    impact of losses resulting from volatile currencies and other    risks of doing business abroad, the Company cannot be ensured    that such measures will be adequate. If the    Company fails to maintain effective internal controls, it may    not be able to report its financial results accurately or timely    or detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on    the Companys business or stock price.     Effective internal controls are necessary for the Company to    provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial    reports and to effectively prevent fraud. If the Company cannot    provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial    reports and effectively prevent fraud, its brand and operating    results could be harmed. Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of    2002, the Company is required to furnish a report by management    on internal control over financial reporting, including    managements assessment of the effectiveness of such    control. Internal control over financial reporting may not    prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent    limitations, including the possibility of human error, the    circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore,    even effective internal controls cannot provide absolute    assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation    of financial statements. In addition, projections of any    evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial    reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the    11Table of Contents    control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,    or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures    may deteriorate. If the Company fails to maintain the adequacy    of its internal controls, including any failure to implement    required new or improved controls, or if the Company experiences    difficulties in their implementation, the Companys    business and operating results could be harmed, and the Company    could fail to meet its reporting obligations, which could have a    material adverse effect on its business and the share price. If the    Companys internal information systems fail to function    properly, its business operations could suffer.     The Companys expanding operations put increasing reliance    on the Companys internal information systems in producing    timely, accurate and reliable reports on financial and    operational results. Currently, the Companys global    operations are tracked with multiple internal information    systems. The Company recently implemented a new financial system    for its North America operations. There is no guarantee that the    Company will be successful at all times or that there will not    be integration difficulties that will adversely affect the    Companys operations or the accurate recording and    reporting of financial data. In addition, these systems are    subject to computer hacking or other general system failure.    Maintaining and operating these systems requires continuous    investments. Failure of any of these internal information    systems or material difficulties in upgrading these information    systems could have material adverse effects on the    Companys business and its compliance with securities laws. "

Forward-Looking Statements And Risk Factors
     This Report contains forward-looking statements with respect tothe financial condition, results of operations and business ofAvnet, Inc. and subsidiaries (Avnet or theCompany). These statements are generally identifiedby words like believes, expects,anticipates, should, will,may, estimates or similar expressions.Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions,risks and uncertainties.     Avnet does not undertake any obligation to update anyforward-looking statements, whether as a result of newinformation, future events or otherwise.     Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially fromthose contained in the forward-looking statements include thefollowing:An industry down-cycle in semiconductors could    significantly affect the Companys operating results as a    large portion of our revenues come from sales of semiconductors,    which is a highly cyclical industry.     The semiconductor industry historically has experienced periodicfluctuations in product supply and demand, often associated withchanges in technology and manufacturing capacity, and isgenerally considered to be highly cyclical. During each of thelast three fiscal years, sales of semiconductors representedover 50% of the Companys consolidated sales, and theCompanys revenues, particularly in the CompanysElectronics Marketing group, closely follow the strength orweakness of the semiconductor market. While the semiconductorindustry has strengthened recently as compared with the downturnexperienced in 2001 and 2002, it is uncertain whether thisimprovement will continue and future downturns in the technologyindustry, particularly in the semiconductor sector, couldnegatively affect the Companys operating results in thefuture and negatively impact the Companys ability tomaintain its current profitability levels.Failure to maintain its relationships with key suppliers    could adversely affect the Companys sales.     One of the Companys competitive strengths is the breadthand quality of the suppliers whose product the Companydistributes. However, sales of products and services from two ofthe Companys suppliers, IBM and Xilinx, accounted forapproximately 16% and 10%, respectively, of the Companysconsolidated sales in fiscal year 2006. Management expects IBMand Xilinx products and services to each account for over 10% ofthe Companys consolidated sales in fiscal year 2007. TheCompanys contracts with its suppliers, including thosewith IBM and Xilinx, vary in duration and are generallyterminable by either party at will upon notice. To the extentIBM, Xilinx or a group of other primary suppliers is not willingto do business with the Company in the future, theCompanys business and relationships with its customerscould be materially, adversely affected because its customersdepend on the Companys distribution of electroniccomponents and computer products from the industrysleading suppliers. In addition, to the extent that any of theCompanys key suppliers modifies the terms of theircontracts, including, without limitation, the terms regardingprice protection, rights of return, rebates or other terms thatprotect the Companys gross margins, it could materially,adversely affect the Companys results of operations,financial condition or liquidity.The Company may not have adequate or cost-effective    liquidity or capital resources.     The Companys ability to satisfy its cash needs depends onits ability to generate cash from operations and to access thefinancial markets, both of which are subject to generaleconomic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory andother factors that are beyond the Companys control.     The Company may need to satisfy its cash needs through externalfinancing. However, external financing may not be available tous on acceptable terms or at all. As of July 1, 2006, Avnethad total debt outstanding of $1.23 billion under variousnotes and committed and uncommitted lines of credit withfinancial institutions. The Company needs cash to make interestpayments on, and to refinance, this indebtedness and for generalcorporate purposes, such as funding its ongoing working capitaland capital expenditure needs. Under the terms of any externalfinancing, the Company may incur higher than expected financingexpenses and become9Table of Contentssubject to additional restrictions and covenants. Any materialincrease in the Companys financing costs could have amaterial adverse effect on its profitability.     Under some of its various credit facilities, the Company isrequired to maintain certain specified financial ratios and meetcertain tests. If the Company fails to meet these financialratios and tests, it may be unable to continue to utilize thesefacilities. If the Company could not continue to utilize thesefacilities, it may not have sufficient cash available to makeinterest payments on and refinance indebtedness and for generalcorporate needs.The agreements governing some of the Companys    financings contain various covenants and restrictions that limit    the discretion of management in operating its business and could    prevent us from engaging in some activities that may be    beneficial to the Companys business.     The agreements governing the Companys financing, includingits five-year, $500 million credit facility and theindentures governing the Companys outstanding notes,contain various covenants and restrictions that, in certaincircumstances, limit the Companys ability and the abilityof certain subsidiaries to:      grant liens on assets;       make restricted payments (including paying dividends on capital    stock or redeeming or repurchasing capital stock);       make investments;       merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of the    Companys assets;       incur additional debt; or       engage in certain transactions with affiliates.     As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the Company maybe limited in how it conducts its business and may be unable toraise additional debt, compete effectively or make investments.Declines in the value of the Companys inventory or    unexpected order cancellations by the Companys customers    could materially, adversely affect its business, results of    operations, financial condition or liquidity.     The electronic components and computer products industry issubject to rapid technological change, new and enhanced productsand evolving industry standards, which can contribute to adecline in value or obsolescence of inventory. During anindustry and/or economic downturn, it is possible that priceswill decline due to an oversupply of product and, therefore,there may be greater risk of declines in inventory value.Although it is the policy of many of the Companyssuppliers to offer distributors like us certain protections fromthe loss in value of inventory (such as price protection,limited rights of return and rebates), the Company cannot beassured that such return policies and rebates will fullycompensate us for the loss in value, or that the vendors willchoose to, or be able to, honor such agreements, some of whichare not documented and therefore subject to the discretion ofthe vendor. In addition, the Companys sales are typicallymade pursuant to individual purchase orders, and the Companygenerally does not have long-term supply arrangements with itscustomers. Generally, the Companys customers may cancelorders 30 days prior to shipment with minimal penalties.The Company cannot be assured that unforeseen new productdevelopments, declines in the value of the Companysinventory or unforeseen order cancellations by its customerswill not materially, adversely affect the Companysbusiness, results of operations, financial condition orliquidity, or that the Company will successfully manage itsexisting and future inventories.10Table of ContentsSubstantial defaults by the Companys customers on    its accounts receivable or the loss of significant customers    could have a significant negative impact on the Companys    business, results of operations, financial condition or    liquidity.     A significant portion of the Companys working capitalconsists of accounts receivable from customers. If customersresponsible for a significant amount of accounts receivable wereto become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay for products andservices, or were to become unwilling or unable to make paymentsin a timely manner, the Companys business, results ofoperations, financial condition or liquidity could be adverselyaffected. An economic or industry downturn could adversely andmaterially affect the servicing of these accounts receivable,which could result in longer payment cycles, increasedcollection costs and defaults in excess of managementsexpectations. A significant deterioration in the Companysability to collect on accounts receivable could also impact thecost or availability of financing under its SecuritizationProgram.The electronics component and computer industries are    highly competitive and if the Company cannot effectively    compete, its revenues may decline.     The market for the Companys products and services is verycompetitive and subject to rapid technological advances. Notonly does the Company compete with other global distributors, italso competes for customers with regional distributors and someof the Companys own suppliers. The Companys failureto maintain and enhance its competitive position could adverselyaffect its business and prospects. Furthermore, theCompanys efforts to compete in the marketplace could causedeterioration of gross profit margins and, thus, overallprofitability.     The sizes of the Companys competitors vary across marketsectors, as do the resources the Company has allocated to thesectors in which it does business. Therefore, some of thecompetitors may have greater financial, personnel, capacity andother resources or a more extensive customer base than theCompany has in one or more of its market sectors.The Companys    non-U.S. locations    represent a significant and growing portion of its revenue, and    consequently, the Company are increasingly exposed to risks    associated with operating internationally.     During fiscal year 2006, 2005 and 2004, approximately 49%, 48%and 47%, respectively, of the Companys sales came from itsoperations outside the United States. Most notable in thisgrowth ofnon-U.S. sales isthe increasing volume of sales activity in the Asia region,which accounted for approximately 18% of consolidated salesduring fiscal year 2006. As a result of the Companysforeign sales and locations, its operations are subject to avariety of risks that are specific to international operations,including, but not limited to, the following:      potential restrictions on the Companys ability to    repatriate funds from its foreign subsidiaries;       foreign currency fluctuations and the impact on the    Companys reported results of operations of the translation    of the foreign currencies to U.S. dollars;       import and export duties and value added taxes;       import and export regulation changes;       changing foreign tax laws and regulations;       political instability, terrorism and potential military    conflicts;       inflexible employee contracts in the event of business    downturns; and       the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws.     The Company has operations in several locations in emerging ordeveloping economies that have a potential for higher risk. Therisks associated with these economies include currencyvolatility and other economic or political risks. While theCompany has and will continue to adopt measures to reduce theimpact of losses resulting from volatile currencies and otherrisks of doing business abroad, the Company cannot be ensuredthat such measures will be adequate.11Table of ContentsIf the Company fails to maintain effective internal    controls, it may not be able to report its financial results    accurately or timely or detect fraud, which could have a    material adverse effect on the Companys business.     Effective internal controls are necessary for the Company toprovide reasonable assurance with respect to its financialreports and to effectively prevent fraud. If the Company cannotprovide reasonable assurance with respect to its financialreports and effectively prevent fraud, its brand and operatingresults could be harmed. Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of2002, the Company is required to furnish a report by managementon internal control over financial reporting, includingmanagements assessment of the effectiveness of suchcontrol. Internal control over financial reporting may notprevent or detect misstatements because of its inherentlimitations, including the possibility of human error, thecircumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore,even effective internal controls cannot provide absoluteassurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentationof financial statements. In addition, projections of anyevaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financialreporting to future periods are subject to the risk that thecontrol may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,or that the degree of compliance with the policies or proceduresmay deteriorate. If the Company fails to maintain the adequacyof its internal controls, including any failure to implementrequired new or improved controls, or if the Company experiencesdifficulties in their implementation, the Companysbusiness and operating results could be harmed, and the Companycould fail to meet its reporting obligations, which could have amaterial adverse effect on its business.If the Companys internal information systems fail to    function properly, its business operations could suffer.     The Companys expanding global operations, as well asfaster financial reporting requirements imposed by theSecurities and Exchange Commission, put increasing reliance onthe Companys internal information systems in producingtimely, accurate and reliable reports on financial andoperational results. Currently, the Companys globaloperations are tracked with multiple internal informationsystems. These systems are subject to computer hacking or othergeneral system failure. Maintaining and operating these systemsrequires continuous investments. There is no guarantee that theCompany will be successful at all times or that there will notbe integration difficulties that will adversely affect theCompanys operations or the accurate recording andreporting of financial data. Failure of any of these internalinformation systems or material difficulties in upgrading itssystems could have material adverse effects on theCompanys business"
