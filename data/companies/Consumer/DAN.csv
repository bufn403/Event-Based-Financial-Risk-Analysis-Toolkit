13,DAN,DANA INC,2024-02-20,"Risk Factors
 We are impacted by events and conditions that affect the light vehicle, commercial vehicle and off-highway markets that we serve, as well as by factors specific to Dana. Among the risks that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations are the following, many of which are interrelated. Risk Factors
 Related to the Markets We Serve A downturn in the global economy could have a substantial adverse effect on our business. Our business is tied to general economic and industry conditions as demand for vehicles depends largely on the strength of the economy, employment levels, consumer confidence levels, the availability and cost of credit and the cost of fuel. These factors have had and could continue to have a substantial impact on our business. Adverse global economic conditions could also cause our customers and suppliers to experience severe economic constraints in the future, including bankruptcy, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by climate change, natural catastrophes or public health crises, in the locations in which we, our customers or our suppliers operate. There is global scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) continue to alter the composition of Earth’s atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate. These considerations may lead to new international, national, regional, or local legislative or regulatory responses. Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders, and non-governmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors, including Dana, are continuing to look for ways to reduce GHG emissions. The regulation of GHG emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources or the imposition of carbon pricing mechanisms could result in additional costs to Dana in the form of taxes or emission allowances, facilities improvements, and energy costs, which would increase Dana’s operating costs through higher utility, transportation, and materials costs. Because the impact of any future climate change-related legislative, regulatory, or product standard requirements on Dana’s global businesses and products is dependent on the timing and design of mandates or standards, Dana is unable to predict their potential impact at this time. The potential physical impacts of climate change on Dana’s facilities, suppliers, and customers and therefore on Dana’s operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographic regions. These may include extreme weather events and long-term changes in temperature levels and water availability. These potential physical effects may adversely affect the demand for Dana’s products and the cost, production, sales, and financial performance of Dana’s operations. A natural disaster could disrupt our operations, or our customers’ or suppliers’ operations and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Although we have continuity plans designed to mitigate the impact of natural disasters on our operations, those plans may be insufficient, and any catastrophe may disrupt our ability to manufacture and deliver products to our customers, resulting in an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. In addition, our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises, such as epidemics and pandemics, which could harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer. Pandemics, such as the novel coronavirus disease (COVID) pandemic, may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Efforts to combat a pandemic can be complicated by viral variants and uneven access to, and acceptance and effectiveness of, vaccines globally. Pandemics may negatively impact the global economy, disrupt our operations as well as those of our customers, suppliers, and the global supply chains in which we participate, and create significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. The extent of the impact of a pandemic on our business and financial performance, including our ability to execute our near-term and long-term operational, strategic, and capital structure initiatives, will depend on the duration and severity of the pandemic, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. We may face facility closure requirements and other operational restrictions with respect to some or all of our locations for prolonged periods of time due to, among other factors, evolving and increasingly stringent governmental restrictions including public health directives, quarantine policies or social distancing measures. We operate as part of the complex integrated global supply chains of our largest customers. As a pandemic dissipates at varying times and rates in different regions around the world, there could be a prolonged negative impact on these global supply chains. Our ability to continue operations at specific facilities will be impacted by the interdependencies of the various participants of these global supply chains, which are largely beyond our direct control. A prolonged shut down of these global supply chains would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Rising interest rates could have a substantial adverse effect on our business Rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity, the financial condition of our customers and the financial condition of the end customers who ultimately create demand for the products we supply, all of which could negatively affect demand for our products. An increase in interest rates could make it difficult for us to obtain financing at attractive rates, impacting our ability to execute on our growth strategies or future acquisitions.       7     Table of Contents We could be adversely impacted by the loss of any of our significant customers, changes in their requirements for our products or changes in their financial condition. We are reliant upon sales to several significant customers. Sales to our ten largest customers accounted for 55% of our overall sales in 2023. Changes in our business relationships with any of our large customers or in the timing, size and continuation of their various programs could have a material adverse impact on us. The loss of any of these customers, the loss of business with respect to one or more of their vehicle models on which we have high component content, or a significant decline in the production levels of such vehicles would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Pricing pressure from our customers also poses certain risks. Inability on our part to offset pricing concessions with cost reductions would adversely affect our profitability. We are continually bidding on new business with these customers, as well as seeking to diversify our customer base, but there is no assurance that our efforts will be successful. Further, to the extent that the financial condition of our largest customers deteriorates, including possible bankruptcies, mergers or liquidations, or their sales otherwise decline, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected. We may be adversely impacted by changes in international legislative and political conditions. We operate in 31 countries around the world and we depend on significant foreign suppliers and customers. Further, we have several growth initiatives that are targeting emerging markets like China and India. Legislative and political activities within the countries where we conduct business, particularly in emerging markets and less developed countries, could adversely impact our ability to operate in those countries. The political situation in a number of countries in which we operate could create instability in our contractual relationships with no effective legal safeguards for resolution of these issues, or potentially result in the seizure of our assets. We operate in Argentina, where trade-related initiatives and other government restrictions limit our ability to optimize operating effectiveness. At December 31, 2023, our net asset exposure related to Argentina was approximately $50, including $20 of net fixed assets. We may be adversely impacted by changes in trade policies and proposed or imposed tariffs, including but not limited to, the imposition of new tariffs by the U.S. government on imports to the U.S. and/or the imposition of retaliatory tariffs by foreign countries. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (the Trade Act), gives the executive branch of the U.S. government broad authority to restrict imports in the interest of national security by imposing tariffs. Tariffs imposed on imported steel and aluminum could raise the costs associated with manufacturing our products. We work with our customers to recover a portion of any increased costs, and with our suppliers to defray costs, associated with tariffs. While we have been successful in the past recovering a significant portion of costs increases, there is no assurance that cost increases resulting from trade policies and tariffs will not adversely impact our profitability. Our sales may also be adversely impacted if tariffs are assessed directly on the products we produce or on our customers’ products containing content sourced from us. We may be adversely impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies in the other countries in which we do business. Approximately 57% of our sales in 2023 were from operations located in countries other than the U.S. Currency variations can have an impact on our results (expressed in U.S. dollars). Currency variations can also adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the U.S. and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from affiliates or other suppliers located outside of the U.S. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and currencies of other countries in which we have operations could have an adverse effect on our results reported in U.S. dollars. We use a combination of natural hedging techniques and financial derivatives to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risks. Such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations. We may be adversely impacted by new laws, regulations or policies of governmental organizations related to increased fuel economy standards and reduced greenhouse gas emissions, or changes in existing ones. The markets and customers we serve are subject to substantial government regulation, which often differs by state, region and country. These regulations, and proposals for additional regulation, are advanced primarily out of concern for the environment (including concerns about global climate change and its impact) and energy independence. We anticipate that the number and extent of these regulations, and the costs to comply with them, will increase significantly in the future. In the U.S., vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions are regulated under a harmonized national program administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Other governments in the markets we serve are also creating new policies to address these same issues, including the European Union, Brazil, China and India. These government regulatory requirements could significantly affect our customers by altering their global product development plans and substantially increasing their costs, which could result in limitations on the types of vehicles they sell and the geographical markets they serve. Any of these outcomes could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.       8     Table of Contents Company-Specific Risk Factors
 We have taken, and continue to take, cost-reduction actions. Although our process includes planning for potential negative consequences, the cost-reduction actions may expose us to additional production risk and could adversely affect our sales, profitability and ability to retain and attract employees. We have been reducing costs in all of our businesses and have discontinued product lines, exited businesses, consolidated manufacturing operations and positioned operations in lower cost locations. The impact of these cost-reduction actions on our sales and profitability may be influenced by many factors including our ability to successfully complete these ongoing efforts, our ability to generate the level of cost savings we expect or that are necessary to enable us to effectively compete, delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, decline in employee morale and the potential inability to meet operational targets due to our inability to retain or recruit key employees. We depend on our subsidiaries for cash to satisfy the obligations of the company. Our subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and own substantially all of our assets. Our cash flow and our ability to meet our obligations depend on the cash flow of our subsidiaries. In addition, the payment of funds in the form of dividends, intercompany payments, tax sharing payments and otherwise may be subject to restrictions under the laws of the countries of incorporation of our subsidiaries or the by-laws of the subsidiary. Labor stoppages or work slowdowns at Dana, key suppliers or our customers could result in a disruption in our operations and have a material adverse effect on our businesses. We and our customers rely on our respective suppliers to provide parts needed to maintain production levels. We all rely on workforces represented by labor unions. Workforce disputes that result in work stoppages or slowdowns could disrupt operations of all of these businesses, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the supply of, or demand for, the products we supply our customers. We could be adversely affected if we are unable to recover portions of commodity (including costs of steel and other raw materials), labor, transportation and energy costs from our customers. Commodity, labor, transportation and energy costs have been volatile over the past several of years creating pressure on our profit margins. We continue to work with our customers to recover a portion of our material cost increases. While we have been successful in the past recovering a significant portion of such cost increases, there is no assurance that increases in commodity costs, which can be impacted by a variety of factors, including changes in trade laws and tariffs, will not adversely impact our profitability in the future. We may also experience labor shortages in certain geographies and increased competition for qualified candidates. These shortages could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and increase labor costs, which would reduce our profitability. Standard freight may increase due to shipping container and truck driver shortages and port congestion attributable to global supply chain disruptions resulting from regional and global pandemics and conflicts. We may also incur significant premium freight, resulting from frequent changes in customer order patterns. If we are unable to pass labor, transportation and energy cost increases on to our customer base or otherwise mitigate the costs, our profit margin could be adversely affected. We could be adversely affected if we experience shortages of components from our suppliers or if disruptions in the supply chain lead to parts shortages for our customers. A substantial portion of our annual cost of sales is driven by the purchase of goods and services. To manage and minimize these costs, we have been consolidating our supplier base. As a result, we are dependent on single sources of supply for some components of our products. We select our suppliers based on total value (including price, delivery and quality), taking into consideration their production capacities and financial condition, and we expect that they will be able to support our needs. However, there is no assurance that adverse financial conditions, including bankruptcies of our suppliers, reduced levels of production, natural disasters or other problems experienced by our suppliers will not result in shortages or delays in their supply of components to us or even in the financial collapse of one or more such suppliers. If we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers, particularly those who are sole sources, and were unable to procure the components from other sources, we would be unable to meet our production schedules for some of our key products and to ship such products to our customers in a timely fashion, which would adversely affect our sales, profitability and customer relations. Adverse economic conditions, natural disasters and other factors can similarly lead to financial distress or production problems for other suppliers to our customers which can create disruptions to our production levels. Any such supply-chain induced disruptions to our production are likely to create operating inefficiencies that will adversely affect our sales, profitability and customer relations. Our profitability and results of operations may be adversely affected by program launch difficulties. The launch of new business is a complex process, the success of which depends on a wide range of factors, including the production readiness of our manufacturing facilities and manufacturing processes and those of our suppliers, as well as factors related to tooling, equipment, employees, initial product quality and other factors. Our failure to successfully launch material new or takeover business could have an adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.       9     Table of Contents We use important intellectual property in our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected. We own important intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements. Our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve. Our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license. Further, as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the protection of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases, despite efforts we undertake to protect them. Developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights, and any inability to protect these rights, could have a material adverse impact on our business and our competitive position. We could encounter unexpected difficulties integrating acquisitions and operating joint ventures. We acquired businesses in recent years, and we may complete additional acquisitions and investments in the future that complement or expand our businesses. The success of this strategy will depend on our ability to successfully complete these transactions or arrangements, to integrate the businesses acquired in these transactions and to develop satisfactory working arrangements with our strategic partners in the joint ventures. We could encounter unexpected difficulties in completing these transactions and integrating the acquisitions with our existing operations. We also may not realize the degree or timing of benefits anticipated when we entered into a transaction. Several of our joint ventures operate pursuant to established agreements and, as such, we do not unilaterally control the joint venture. There is a risk that the partners’ objectives for the joint venture may not be aligned with ours, leading to potential differences over management of the joint venture that could adversely impact its financial performance and consequent contribution to our earnings. Additionally, inability on the part of our partners to satisfy their contractual obligations under the agreements could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. Certain of our joint venture partners have the ability to put their ownership interests to Dana at fair value. If a joint venture partner were to put its ownership interest to Dana, it could cause Dana to outlay significant amounts of cash to purchase the joint venture partner's ownership interest in addition to increased future cash outlays required to fund 100% of the operations on a go-forward basis, reducing available funds for other strategic initiatives and capital investments. We could be adversely impacted by the costs of environmental, health, safety and product liability compliance. Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries that govern emissions to the air; discharges to water; the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials; and the cleanup of contaminated properties. Historically, environmental costs related to our former and existing operations have not been material. However, there is no assurance that the costs of complying with current environmental laws and regulations, or those that may be adopted in the future, will not increase and adversely impact us. There is also no assurance that the costs of complying with current laws and regulations, or those that may be adopted in the future, that relate to health, safety and product liability matters will not adversely impact us. There is also a risk of warranty and product liability claims, as well as product recalls, if our products fail to perform to specifications or cause property damage, injury or death. (See Notes 15 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on product liabilities and warranties.) A failure of our information technology infrastructure could adversely impact our business and operations. We recognize the increasing volume of cyber attacks and employ commercially practical efforts to provide reasonable assurance that the risks of such attacks are appropriately mitigated. Each year, we evaluate the threat profile of our industry to stay abreast of trends and to provide reasonable assurance our existing countermeasures will address any new threats identified. Despite our implementation of security measures, our IT systems and those of our service providers are vulnerable to circumstances beyond our reasonable control including acts of terror, acts of government, natural disasters, civil unrest and denial of service attacks which may lead to the theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or business disruption. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers, suppliers and employees, lead to claims against the company and ultimately harm our business. Additionally, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future. We participate in certain multi-employer pension plans which are not fully funded. We contribute to certain multi-employer defined benefit pension plans for certain of our union-represented employees in the U.S. in accordance with our collective bargaining agreements. Contributions are based on hours worked except in cases of layoff or leave where we generally contribute based on 40 hours per week for a maximum of one year. The plans are not fully funded as of December 31, 2023. We could be held liable to the plans for our obligation, as well as those of other employers, due to our participation in the plans. Contribution rates could increase if the plans are required to adopt a funding improvement plan, if the performance of plan assets does not meet expectations or as a result of future collectively bargained wage and benefit agreements. (See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on multi-employer pension plans.) Changes in interest rates and asset returns could increase our pension funding obligations and reduce our profitability. We have unfunded obligations under certain of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The valuation of our future payment obligations under the plans and the related plan assets are subject to significant adverse changes if the credit and capital markets cause interest rates and projected rates of return to decline. Such declines could also require us to make significant additional contributions to our pension plans in the future. A material increase in the unfunded obligations of these plans could also result in a significant increase in our pension expense in the future.       10     Table of Contents We may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure. Our provision for income taxes and the cash outlays required to satisfy our income tax obligations in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors. These factors include changes in the level of earnings in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in our plans to repatriate the earnings of our non-U.S. operations to the U.S. and changes in tax laws and regulations. Our income tax returns are subject to examination by federal, state and local tax authorities in the U.S. and tax authorities outside the U.S. The results of these examinations and the ongoing assessments of our tax exposures could also have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and the cash outlays required to satisfy our income tax obligations. An inability to provide products with the technology required to satisfy customer requirements would adversely impact our ability to successfully compete in our markets. The vehicular markets in which we operate are undergoing significant technological change, with increasing focus on electrified and autonomous vehicles. These and other technological advances could render certain of our products obsolete. Maintaining our competitive position is dependent on our ability to develop commercially-viable products and services that support the future technologies embraced by our customers. We could be adversely impacted by increased competition in the markets we serve. The mobility industry is beginning to shift away from petroleum fuel vehicles (""ICE"" vehicles) and migrate to alternate fuel vehicles (as a group ""EV-based vehicles""). As the market transitions from ICE vehicles to EV-based vehicles, the Company anticipates its content per vehicle opportunity will increase up to three-fold on a dollar basis. The Company's primary driveline content on ICE vehicles includes axles and driveshafts. As the market transitions to EV-based vehicles we anticipate losing driveshaft content but adding additional driveline content in the form of gearboxes, e-motors, e-axles, power electronics, and software controls. We anticipate a similar three-fold opportunity in thermal and sealing products, as current ICE-vehicle content is replaced with EV-based vehicle content including metallic bipolar plates, battery cold plates and power electronic cooling modules. With the increased content opportunity presented by EV-based vehicles, we are beginning to see increased competition when it comes to bidding on new customer programs. The number of competitors bidding on EV-based vehicle programs is higher than what we historically experienced on ICE vehicle programs. In addition, our OEM customers continue to assess which EV-based components they will vertically integrate and for which programs. A significant increase in competition for EV-based vehicle programs from existing and new market entrants could negatively impact our sales and profitability. A significant increase in vertical integration of EV-based vehicle components by our OEM customers could negatively impact our sales and profitability. We could be adversely impacted by an extended transition period away from petroleum fuel vehicles to alternate fuel vehicles. As the market transitions from ICE vehicles to EV-based vehicles, we will continue to experience elevated levels of research and development costs, capital investment and inventory levels. During the transition period, we will need to maintain production capacity to meet both ICE and EV-related customer demand, requiring incremental capital investment and reducing our ability to operate at scale. In addition, we will need to maintain incremental levels of inventory to satisfy ICE and EV-related customer demand, as raw materials and components used in the production of ICE and EV-related products are largely unique. An extended transition period could negatively impact our profitability, cash flows and financial position. Failure to appropriately anticipate and react to the cyclical and volatile nature of production rates and customer demands in our business can adversely impact our results of operations. Our financial performance is directly related to production levels of our customers. In several of our markets, customer production levels are prone to significant cyclicality, influenced by general economic conditions, changing consumer preferences, regulatory changes, and other factors. Oftentimes the rapidity of the downcycles and upcycles can be severe. Successfully executing operationally during periods of extreme downward and upward demand pressures can be challenging. Our inability to recognize and react appropriately to the production cycles inherent in our markets can adversely impact our operating results. Our continued success is dependent on being able to retain and attract requisite talent. Sustaining and growing our business requires that we continue to retain, develop and attract people with the requisite skills. With the vehicles of the future expected to undergo significant technological change, having qualified people savvy in the right technologies will be a key factor in our ability to develop the products necessary to successfully compete in the future. As a global organization, we are also dependent on our ability to attract and maintain a diverse work force that is fully engaged supporting our company’s objectives and initiatives. Failure to maintain effective internal controls could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Regulatory provisions governing the financial reporting of U.S. public companies require that we maintain effective disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting across our operations in 31 countries. Effective internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance of compliance, and, as such, they can be susceptible to human error, circumvention or override, and fraud. Failure to maintain adequate, effective internal controls could result in potential financial misstatements or other forms of noncompliance that have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or organizational reputation.       11     Table of Contents Our working capital requirements may negatively affect our liquidity. Our working capital requirements can vary significantly, depending in part on the level, variability and timing of our customers’ orders and production schedules and availability of raw materials and components from our suppliers. As production volumes increase, our working capital requirements to support the higher volumes generally increase. If our working capital needs exceed our cash flows from operations, we look to our cash and cash equivalents balances and unused capacity of our Revolving Facility to satisfy those needs, as well as other potential sources of additional capital, which may not be available on satisfactory terms or in adequate amounts. Developments in the financial markets or downgrades to Dana's credit rating could restrict our access to capital and increase financing costs. At December 31, 2023, Dana had consolidated debt obligations of $2,679, with cash and cash equivalents of $529 and unused revolving credit capacity of $1,141. Our ability to grow the business and satisfy debt service obligations is dependent, in part, on our ability to gain access to capital at competitive costs. External factors beyond our control can adversely affect capital markets – either tightening availability of capital or increasing the cost of available capital. Failure on our part to maintain adequate financial performance and appropriate credit metrics can also affect our ability to access capital at competitive prices. Increased scrutiny from the public, investors, and others regarding our environmental, social, and governance (""ESG"") practices could impact our reputation. We have a board committee and an executive officer position with responsibility for sustainability, additional dedicated employee resources, a cross-functional/business sustainability leadership team to further develop and implement an enterprise-wide sustainability strategy, and we have published a sustainability report. Our sustainability report includes our policies and practices on a variety of ESG matters, including the value creation opportunities provided by our products; diversity, equity, and inclusion; employee health and safety; community giving; and human capital management. These efforts may result in increased investor, media, employee, and other stakeholder attention to such initiatives, and such stakeholders may not be satisfied with our ESG practices or initiatives. Additionally, organizations that inform investors on ESG matters have developed rating systems for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG. Unfavorable ratings may lead to negative investor sentiment, which could negatively impact our stock price and our ability to access capital at competitive prices. Any failure, or perceived failure, to respond to ESG concerns could harm our business and reputation. Risk Factors
 Related to our Securities Provisions in our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may discourage a takeover attempt. Certain provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, as well as the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Dana. Such provisions, including those governing the nomination of directors, limiting who may call special stockholders’ meetings and eliminating stockholder action by written consent, may make it more difficult for other persons, without the approval of our board of directors, to make a tender offer or otherwise acquire substantial amounts of common stock or to launch other takeover attempts that a stockholder might consider to be in such stockholder’s best interest. "

 We are impacted by events and conditions that affect the light vehicle, commercial vehicle and off-highway markets that we serve, as well as by factors specific to Dana. Among the risks that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations are the following, many of which are interrelated. Risk Factors
 Related to the Markets We Serve A downturn in the global economy could have a substantial adverse effect on our business. Our business is tied to general economic and industry conditions as demand for vehicles depends largely on the strength of the economy, employment levels, consumer confidence levels, the availability and cost of credit and the cost of fuel. These factors have had and could continue to have a substantial impact on our business. Adverse global economic conditions could also cause our customers and suppliers to experience severe economic constraints in the future, including bankruptcy, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by climate change, natural catastrophes or public health crises, in the locations in which we, our customers or our suppliers operate. There is global scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) continue to alter the composition of Earth’s atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate.

The potential physical impacts of climate change on Dana’s facilities, suppliers, and customers and therefore on Dana’s operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographic regions. These may include extreme weather events and long-term changes in temperature levels and water availability. These potential physical effects may adversely affect the demand for Dana’s products and the cost, production, sales, and financial performance of Dana’s operations. A natural disaster could disrupt our operations, or our customers’ or suppliers’ operations and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Further, we have several growth initiatives that are targeting emerging markets like China and India. Legislative and political activities within the countries where we conduct business, particularly in emerging markets and less developed countries, could adversely impact our ability to operate in those countries. The political situation in a number of countries in which we operate could create instability in our contractual relationships with no effective legal safeguards for resolution of these issues, or potentially result in the seizure of our assets. We operate in Argentina, where trade-related initiatives and other government restrictions limit our ability to optimize operating effectiveness. At December 31, 2022, our net asset exposure related to Argentina was approximately $44, including $18 of net fixed assets. We may be adversely impacted by changes in trade policies and proposed or imposed tariffs, including but not limited to, the imposition of new tariffs by the U.S. government on imports to the U.S. and/or the imposition of retaliatory tariffs by foreign countries. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (the Trade Act), gives the executive branch of the U.S. government broad authority to restrict imports in the interest of national security by imposing tariffs. Tariffs imposed on imported steel and aluminum could raise the costs associated with manufacturing our products. We work with our customers to recover a portion of any increased costs, and with our suppliers to defray costs, associated with tariffs. While we have been successful in the past recovering a significant portion of costs increases, there is no assurance that cost increases resulting from trade policies and tariffs will not adversely impact our profitability. Our sales may also be adversely impacted if tariffs are assessed directly on the products we produce or on our customers’ products containing content sourced from us. We may be adversely impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies in the other countries in which we do business. Approximately 54% of our sales in 2022 were from operations located in countries other than the U.S. Currency variations can have an impact on our results (expressed in U.S. dollars). Currency variations can also adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the U.S. and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from affiliates or other suppliers located outside of the U.S. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and currencies of other countries in which we have operations could have an adverse effect on our results reported in U.S. dollars. We use a combination of natural hedging techniques and financial derivatives to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risks. Such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations. We may be adversely impacted by new laws, regulations or policies of governmental organizations related to increased fuel economy standards and reduced greenhouse gas emissions, or changes in existing ones. The markets and customers we serve are subject to substantial government regulation, which often differs by state, region and country. These regulations, and proposals for additional regulation, are advanced primarily out of concern for the environment (including concerns about global climate change and its impact) and energy independence. We anticipate that the number and extent of these regulations, and the costs to comply with them, will increase significantly in the future. In the U.S., vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions are regulated under a harmonized national program administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Other governments in the markets we serve are also creating new policies to address these same issues, including the European Union, Brazil, China and India. These government regulatory requirements could significantly affect our customers by altering their global product development plans and substantially increasing their costs, which could result in limitations on the types of vehicles they sell and the geographical markets they serve. Any of these outcomes could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.        8     Table of Contents Company-Specific Risk Factors
 We have taken, and continue to take, cost-reduction actions. Although our process includes planning for potential negative consequences, the cost-reduction actions may expose us to additional production risk and could adversely affect our sales, profitability and ability to retain and attract employees. We have been reducing costs in all of our businesses and have discontinued product lines, exited businesses, consolidated manufacturing operations and positioned operations in lower cost locations. The impact of these cost-reduction actions on our sales and profitability may be influenced by many factors including our ability to successfully complete these ongoing efforts, our ability to generate the level of cost savings we expect or that are necessary to enable us to effectively compete, delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, decline in employee morale and the potential inability to meet operational targets due to our inability to retain or recruit key employees. We depend on our subsidiaries for cash to satisfy the obligations of the company. Our subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and own substantially all of our assets. Our cash flow and our ability to meet our obligations depend on the cash flow of our subsidiaries. In addition, the payment of funds in the form of dividends, intercompany payments, tax sharing payments and otherwise may be subject to restrictions under the laws of the countries of incorporation of our subsidiaries or the by-laws of the subsidiary. Labor stoppages or work slowdowns at Dana, key suppliers or our customers could result in a disruption in our operations and have a material adverse effect on our businesses. We and our customers rely on our respective suppliers to provide parts needed to maintain production levels. We all rely on workforces represented by labor unions. Workforce disputes that result in work stoppages or slowdowns could disrupt operations of all of these businesses, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the supply of, or demand for, the products we supply our customers. We could be adversely affected if we are unable to recover portions of commodity (including costs of steel and other raw materials), labor, transportation and energy costs from our customers. Commodity, labor, transportation and energy costs have risen sharply over the past couple of years creating pressure on our profit margins. We continue to work with our customers to recover a portion of our material cost increases. While we have been successful in the past recovering a significant portion of such cost increases, there is no assurance that increases in commodity costs, which can be impacted by a variety of factors, including changes in trade laws and tariffs, will not adversely impact our profitability in the future. We may also experience labor shortages in certain geographies and increased competition for qualified candidates. These shortages could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and increase labor costs, which would reduce our profitability. Standard freight may increase due to shipping container and truck driver shortages and port congestion attributable to global supply chain disruptions resulting from regional and global pandemics and conflicts. We may also incur significant premium freight, resulting from frequent changes in customer order patterns. If we are unable to pass labor, transportation and energy cost increases on to our customer base or otherwise mitigate the costs, our profit margin could be adversely affected. We could be adversely affected if we experience shortages of components from our suppliers or if disruptions in the supply chain lead to parts shortages for our customers. A substantial portion of our annual cost of sales is driven by the purchase of goods and services. To manage and minimize these costs, we have been consolidating our supplier base. As a result, we are dependent on single sources of supply for some components of our products. We select our suppliers based on total value (including price, delivery and quality), taking into consideration their production capacities and financial condition, and we expect that they will be able to support our needs. However, there is no assurance that adverse financial conditions, including bankruptcies of our suppliers, reduced levels of production, natural disasters or other problems experienced by our suppliers will not result in shortages or delays in their supply of components to us or even in the financial collapse of one or more such suppliers. If we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers, particularly those who are sole sources, and were unable to procure the components from other sources, we would be unable to meet our production schedules for some of our key products and to ship such products to our customers in a timely fashion, which would adversely affect our sales, profitability and customer relations. Adverse economic conditions, natural disasters and other factors can similarly lead to financial distress or production problems for other suppliers to our customers which can create disruptions to our production levels. Any such supply-chain induced disruptions to our production are likely to create operating inefficiencies that will adversely affect our sales, profitability and customer relations. Our profitability and results of operations may be adversely affected by program launch difficulties. The launch of new business is a complex process, the success of which depends on a wide range of factors, including the production readiness of our manufacturing facilities and manufacturing processes and those of our suppliers, as well as factors related to tooling, equipment, employees, initial product quality and other factors. Our failure to successfully launch material new or takeover business could have an adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.        9     Table of Contents We use important intellectual property in our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected. We own important intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements. Our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve. Our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license. Further, as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the protection of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases, despite efforts we undertake to protect them. Developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights, and any inability to protect these rights, could have a material adverse impact on our business and our competitive position. We could encounter unexpected difficulties integrating acquisitions and joint ventures. We acquired businesses in recent years, and we may complete additional acquisitions and investments in the future that complement or expand our businesses. The success of this strategy will depend on our ability to successfully complete these transactions or arrangements, to integrate the businesses acquired in these transactions and to develop satisfactory working arrangements with our strategic partners in the joint ventures. We could encounter unexpected difficulties in completing these transactions and integrating the acquisitions with our existing operations. We also may not realize the degree or timing of benefits anticipated when we entered into a transaction. Several of our joint ventures operate pursuant to established agreements and, as such, we do not unilaterally control the joint venture. There is a risk that the partners’ objectives for the joint venture may not be aligned with ours, leading to potential differences over management of the joint venture that could adversely impact its financial performance and consequent contribution to our earnings. Additionally, inability on the part of our partners to satisfy their contractual obligations under the agreements could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. We could be adversely impacted by the costs of environmental, health, safety and product liability compliance. Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries that govern emissions to the air; discharges to water; the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials; and the cleanup of contaminated properties. Historically, environmental costs related to our former and existing operations have not been material. However, there is no assurance that the costs of complying with current environmental laws and regulations, or those that may be adopted in the future, will not increase and adversely impact us. There is also no assurance that the costs of complying with current laws and regulations, or those that may be adopted in the future, that relate to health, safety and product liability matters will not adversely impact us. There is also a risk of warranty and product liability claims, as well as product recalls, if our products fail to perform to specifications or cause property damage, injury or death. (See Notes 15 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on product liabilities and warranties.) A failure of our information technology infrastructure could adversely impact our business and operations. We recognize the increasing volume of cyber attacks and employ commercially practical efforts to provide reasonable assurance that the risks of such attacks are appropriately mitigated. Each year, we evaluate the threat profile of our industry to stay abreast of trends and to provide reasonable assurance our existing countermeasures will address any new threats identified. Despite our implementation of security measures, our IT systems and those of our service providers are vulnerable to circumstances beyond our reasonable control including acts of terror, acts of government, natural disasters, civil unrest and denial of service attacks which may lead to the theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or business disruption. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers, suppliers and employees, lead to claims against the company and ultimately harm our business. Additionally, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future. We participate in certain multi-employer pension plans which are not fully funded. We contribute to certain multi-employer defined benefit pension plans for certain of our union-represented employees in the U.S. in accordance with our collective bargaining agreements. Contributions are based on hours worked except in cases of layoff or leave where we generally contribute based on 40 hours per week for a maximum of one year. The plans are not fully funded as of December 31, 2022. We could be held liable to the plans for our obligation, as well as those of other employers, due to our participation in the plans. Contribution rates could increase if the plans are required to adopt a funding improvement plan, if the performance of plan assets does not meet expectations or as a result of future collectively bargained wage and benefit agreements. (See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on multi-employer pension plans.) Changes in interest rates and asset returns could increase our pension funding obligations and reduce our profitability. We have unfunded obligations under certain of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The valuation of our future payment obligations under the plans and the related plan assets are subject to significant adverse changes if the credit and capital markets cause interest rates and projected rates of return to decline. Such declines could also require us to make significant additional contributions to our pension plans in the future. A material increase in the unfunded obligations of these plans could also result in a significant increase in our pension expense in the future.        10     Table of Contents We may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure. Our provision for income taxes and the cash outlays required to satisfy our income tax obligations in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors. These factors include changes in the level of earnings in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in our plans to repatriate the earnings of our non-U.S. operations to the U.S. and changes in tax laws and regulations. Our income tax returns are subject to examination by federal, state and local tax authorities in the U.S. and tax authorities outside the U.S. The results of these examinations and the ongoing assessments of our tax exposures could also have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and the cash outlays required to satisfy our income tax obligations. An inability to provide products with the technology required to satisfy customer requirements would adversely impact our ability to successfully compete in our markets. The vehicular markets in which we operate are undergoing significant technological change, with increasing focus on electrified and autonomous vehicles. These and other technological advances could render certain of our products obsolete. Maintaining our competitive position is dependent on our ability to develop commercially-viable products and services that support the future technologies embraced by our customers. We could be adversely impacted by increased competition in the markets we serve. The mobility industry is beginning to shift away from petroleum fuel vehicles (""ICE"" vehicles) and migrate to alternate fuel vehicles (as a group ""EV-based vehicles""). As the market transitions from ICE vehicles to EV-based vehicles, the Company anticipates its content per vehicle opportunity will increase up to three-fold on a dollar basis. The Company's primary driveline content on ICE vehicles includes axles and driveshafts. As the market transitions to EV-based vehicles we anticipate losing driveshaft content but adding additional driveline content in the form of gearboxes, e-motors, e-axles, power electronics, and software controls. We anticipate a similar three-fold opportunity in thermal and sealing products, as current ICE-vehicle content is replaced with EV-based vehicle content including metallic bipolar plates, battery cold plates and power electronic cooling modules. With the increased content opportunity presented by EV-based vehicles, we are beginning to see increased competition when it comes to bidding on new customer programs. The number of competitors bidding on EV-based vehicle programs is higher than what we historically experienced on ICE vehicle programs. In addition, our OEM customers continue to assess which EV-based components they will vertically integrate and for which programs. A significant increase in competition for EV-based vehicle programs from existing and new market entrants could negatively impact our sales and profitability. A significant increase in vertical integration of EV-based vehicle components by our OEM customers could negatively impact our sales and profitability. Failure to appropriately anticipate and react to the cyclical and volatile nature of production rates and customer demands in our business can adversely impact our results of operations. Our financial performance is directly related to production levels of our customers. In several of our markets, customer production levels are prone to significant cyclicality, influenced by general economic conditions, changing consumer preferences, regulatory changes, and other factors. Oftentimes the rapidity of the downcycles and upcycles can be severe. Successfully executing operationally during periods of extreme downward and upward demand pressures can be challenging. Our inability to recognize and react appropriately to the production cycles inherent in our markets can adversely impact our operating results. Our continued success is dependent on being able to retain and attract requisite talent. Sustaining and growing our business requires that we continue to retain, develop and attract people with the requisite skills. With the vehicles of the future expected to undergo significant technological change, having qualified people savvy in the right technologies will be a key factor in our ability to develop the products necessary to successfully compete in the future. As a global organization, we are also dependent on our ability to attract and maintain a diverse work force that is fully engaged supporting our company’s objectives and initiatives. Failure to maintain effective internal controls could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Regulatory provisions governing the financial reporting of U.S. public companies require that we maintain effective disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting across our operations in 31 countries. Effective internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance of compliance, and, as such, they can be susceptible to human error, circumvention or override, and fraud. Failure to maintain adequate, effective internal controls could result in potential financial misstatements or other forms of noncompliance that have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or organizational reputation.        11     Table of Contents Our working capital requirements may negatively affect our liquidity. Our working capital requirements can vary significantly, depending in part on the level, variability and timing of our customers’ orders and production schedules and availability of raw materials and components from our suppliers. As production volumes increase, our working capital requirements to support the higher volumes generally increase. During 2022, residual effects of the COVID pandemic continued to negatively impact the global supply chains in which we participate, necessitating that we carry significantly higher levels of inventory to satisfy customer demand. If our working capital needs exceed our cash flows from operations, we look to our cash and cash equivalents balances and unused capacity of our Revolving Facility to satisfy those needs, as well as other potential sources of additional capital, which may not be available on satisfactory terms or in adequate amounts. Developments in the financial markets or downgrades to Dana's credit rating could restrict our access to capital and increase financing costs. At December 31, 2022, Dana had consolidated debt obligations of $2,430, with cash and cash equivalents of $425 and unused revolving credit capacity of $1,109. Our ability to grow the business and satisfy debt service obligations is dependent, in part, on our ability to gain access to capital at competitive costs. External factors beyond our control can adversely affect capital markets – either tightening availability of capital or increasing the cost of available capital. Failure on our part to maintain adequate financial performance and appropriate credit metrics can also affect our ability to access capital at competitive prices. Increased scrutiny from the public, investors, and others regarding our environmental, social, and governance (""ESG"") practices could impact our reputation. We have a board committee and an executive officer position with responsibility for sustainability, additional dedicated employee resources, a cross-functional/business sustainability leadership team to further develop and implement an enterprise-wide sustainability strategy, and we have published a sustainability report. Our sustainability report includes our policies and practices on a variety of ESG matters, including the value creation opportunities provided by our products; diversity, equity, and inclusion; employee health and safety; community giving; and human capital management. These efforts may result in increased investor, media, employee, and other stakeholder attention to such initiatives, and such stakeholders may not be satisfied with our ESG practices or initiatives. Additionally, organizations that inform investors on ESG matters have developed rating systems for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG. Unfavorable ratings may lead to negative investor sentiment, which could negatively impact our stock price and our ability to access capital at competitive prices. Any failure, or perceived failure, to respond to ESG concerns could harm our business and reputation. Risk Factors
 Related to our Securities Provisions in our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may discourage a takeover attempt. Certain provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, as well as the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Dana. Such provisions, including those governing the nomination of directors, limiting who may call special stockholders’ meetings and eliminating stockholder action by written consent, may make it more difficult for other persons, without the approval of our board of directors, to make a tender offer or otherwise acquire substantial amounts of common stock or to launch other takeover attempts that a stockholder might consider to be in such stockholder’s best interest. "
6,DAN,DANA INC,2022-02-23,"Risk Factors
 We are impacted by events and conditions that affect the light vehicle, medium/heavy vehicle and off-highway markets that we serve, as well as by factors specific to Dana. Among the risks that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations are the following, many of which are interrelated. Risk Factors
 Related to the Markets We Serve A downturn in the global economy could have a substantial adverse effect on our business. Our business is tied to general economic and industry conditions as demand for vehicles depends largely on the strength of the economy, employment levels, consumer confidence levels, the availability and cost of credit and the cost of fuel. These factors have had and could continue to have a substantial impact on our business. Adverse global economic conditions could also cause our customers and suppliers to experience severe economic constraints in the future, including bankruptcy, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by climate change, natural catastrophes or public health crises, in the locations in which we, our customers or our suppliers operate. There is global scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) continue to alter the composition of Earth’s atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate. These considerations may lead to new international, national, regional, or local legislative or regulatory responses. Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders, and non-governmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors, including Dana, are continuing to look for ways to reduce GHG emissions. The regulation of GHG emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources or the imposition of carbon pricing mechanisms could result in additional costs to Dana in the form of taxes or emission allowances, facilities improvements, and energy costs, which would increase Dana’s operating costs through higher utility, transportation, and materials costs. Because the impact of any future climate change-related legislative, regulatory, or product standard requirements on Dana’s global businesses and products is dependent on the timing and design of mandates or standards, Dana is unable to predict their potential impact at this time. The potential physical impacts of climate change on Dana’s facilities, suppliers, and customers and therefore on Dana’s operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographic regions. These may include extreme weather events and long-term changes in temperature levels and water availability. These potential physical effects may adversely affect the demand for Dana’s products and the cost, production, sales, and financial performance of Dana’s operations. A natural disaster could disrupt our operations, or our customers’ or suppliers’ operations and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Although we have continuity plans designed to mitigate the impact of natural disasters on our operations, those plans may be insufficient, and any catastrophe may disrupt our ability to manufacture and deliver products to our customers, resulting in an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. In addition, our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, which could harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer. The novel coronavirus disease (COVID) pandemic has had an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Efforts to combat COVID have been complicated by viral variants and uneven access to, and acceptance and effectiveness of, vaccines globally. The COVID pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted our operations as well as those of our customers, suppliers and the global supply chains in which we participate, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. The extent of the impact of the COVID pandemic on our business and financial performance, including our ability to execute our near-term and long-term operational, strategic and capital structure initiatives, will depend on future developments, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. As a result of the COVID pandemic, and in response to government mandates or recommendations, rapid dissipation of customer demand, as well as decisions we have made to protect the health and safety of our employees and communities, we temporarily closed a significant number of our facilities globally during 2020. We may face facility closure requirements and other operational restrictions with respect to some or all of our locations for prolonged periods of time due to, among other factors, evolving and increasingly stringent governmental restrictions including public health directives, quarantine policies or social distancing measures. We operate as part of the complex integrated global supply chains of our largest customers. As the COVID pandemic dissipates at varying times and rates in different regions around the world, there could be a prolonged negative impact on these global supply chains. Our ability to continue operations at specific facilities will be impacted by the interdependencies of the various participants of these global supply chains, which are largely beyond our direct control. A prolonged shut down of these global supply chains would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Consumer spending may also be negatively impacted by general macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence, including the impacts of any recession, resulting from the COVID pandemic. This may negatively impact the markets we serve and may cause our customers to purchase fewer products from us. Any significant reduction in demand caused by decreased consumer confidence and spending following the pandemic, would result in a loss of sales and profits and other material adverse effects. Rising interest rates could have a substantial adverse effect on our business Rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity, the financial condition of our customers and the financial condition of the end customers who ultimately create demand for the products we supply, all of which could negatively affect demand for our products. An increase in interest rates could make it difficult for us to obtain financing at attractive rates, impacting our ability to execute on our growth strategies or future acquisitions.        7     Table of Contents We could be adversely impacted by the loss of any of our significant customers, changes in their requirements for our products or changes in their financial condition. We are reliant upon sales to several significant customers. Sales to our ten largest customers accounted for 56% of our overall sales in 2021. Changes in our business relationships with any of our large customers or in the timing, size and continuation of their various programs could have a material adverse impact on us. The loss of any of these customers, the loss of business with respect to one or more of their vehicle models on which we have high component content, or a significant decline in the production levels of such vehicles would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Pricing pressure from our customers also poses certain risks. Inability on our part to offset pricing concessions with cost reductions would adversely affect our profitability. We are continually bidding on new business with these customers, as well as seeking to diversify our customer base, but there is no assurance that our efforts will be successful. Further, to the extent that the financial condition of our largest customers deteriorates, including possible bankruptcies, mergers or liquidations, or their sales otherwise decline, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected. We may be adversely impacted by changes in international legislative and political conditions. We operate in 32 countries around the world and we depend on significant foreign suppliers and customers. Further, we have several growth initiatives that are targeting emerging markets like China and India. Legislative and political activities within the countries where we conduct business, particularly in emerging markets and less developed countries, could adversely impact our ability to operate in those countries. The political situation in a number of countries in which we operate could create instability in our contractual relationships with no effective legal safeguards for resolution of these issues, or potentially result in the seizure of our assets. We operate in Argentina, where trade-related initiatives and other government restrictions limit our ability to optimize operating effectiveness. At December 31, 2021, our net asset exposure related to Argentina was approximately $33, including $12 of net fixed assets. We may be adversely impacted by changes in trade policies and proposed or imposed tariffs, including but not limited to, the imposition of new tariffs by the U.S. government on imports to the U.S. and/or the imposition of retaliatory tariffs by foreign countries. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (the Trade Act), gives the executive branch of the U.S. government broad authority to restrict imports in the interest of national security by imposing tariffs. Tariffs imposed on imported steel and aluminum could raise the costs associated with manufacturing our products. We work with our customers to recover a portion of any increased costs, and with our suppliers to defray costs, associated with tariffs. While we have been successful in the past recovering a significant portion of costs increases, there is no assurance that cost increases resulting from trade policies and tariffs will not adversely impact our profitability. Our sales may also be adversely impacted if tariffs are assessed directly on the products we produce or on our customers’ products containing content sourced from us. We may be adversely impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies in the other countries in which we do business. Approximately 55% of our sales in 2021 were from operations located in countries other than the U.S. Currency variations can have an impact on our results (expressed in U.S. dollars). Currency variations can also adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the U.S. and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from affiliates or other suppliers located outside of the U.S. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and currencies of other countries in which we have operations could have an adverse effect on our results reported in U.S. dollars. We use a combination of natural hedging techniques and financial derivatives to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risks. Such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations. We may be adversely impacted by new laws, regulations or policies of governmental organizations related to increased fuel economy standards and reduced greenhouse gas emissions, or changes in existing ones. The markets and customers we serve are subject to substantial government regulation, which often differs by state, region and country. These regulations, and proposals for additional regulation, are advanced primarily out of concern for the environment (including concerns about global climate change and its impact) and energy independence. We anticipate that the number and extent of these regulations, and the costs to comply with them, will increase significantly in the future. In the U.S., vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions are regulated under a harmonized national program administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Other governments in the markets we serve are also creating new policies to address these same issues, including the European Union, Brazil, China and India. These government regulatory requirements could significantly affect our customers by altering their global product development plans and substantially increasing their costs, which could result in limitations on the types of vehicles they sell and the geographical markets they serve. Any of these outcomes could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. The proposed phase out of the London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) could have an adverse effect on our business Our revolving credit facility (the ""Revolving Facility"") utilizes Libor to set the interest rate on any outstanding borrowings.  In July 2017, the head of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced the desire to phase out the use of Libor by the end of 2021. On March 5, 2021, the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (IBA) confirmed that it will cease publication of the one week and two-month USD Libor settings at the end of 2021 and the remaining USD Libor settings at the end of June 2023. The potential effect on our cost of borrowing utilizing a replacement rate cannot yet be determined. In addition, any further changes or reforms to the determination of Libor or its successor rate may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease on our borrowing rate, which could have an adverse impact on extension of credit held by us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.        8     Table of Contents Company-Specific Risk Factors
 We have taken, and continue to take, cost-reduction actions. Although our process includes planning for potential negative consequences, the cost-reduction actions may expose us to additional production risk and could adversely affect our sales, profitability and ability to retain and attract employees. We have been reducing costs in all of our businesses and have discontinued product lines, exited businesses, consolidated manufacturing operations and positioned operations in lower cost locations. The impact of these cost-reduction actions on our sales and profitability may be influenced by many factors including our ability to successfully complete these ongoing efforts, our ability to generate the level of cost savings we expect or that are necessary to enable us to effectively compete, delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, decline in employee morale and the potential inability to meet operational targets due to our inability to retain or recruit key employees. We depend on our subsidiaries for cash to satisfy the obligations of the company. Our subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and own substantially all of our assets. Our cash flow and our ability to meet our obligations depend on the cash flow of our subsidiaries. In addition, the payment of funds in the form of dividends, intercompany payments, tax sharing payments and otherwise may be subject to restrictions under the laws of the countries of incorporation of our subsidiaries or the by-laws of the subsidiary. Labor stoppages or work slowdowns at Dana, key suppliers or our customers could result in a disruption in our operations and have a material adverse effect on our businesses. We and our customers rely on our respective suppliers to provide parts needed to maintain production levels. We all rely on workforces represented by labor unions. Workforce disputes that result in work stoppages or slowdowns could disrupt operations of all of these businesses, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the supply of, or demand for, the products we supply our customers. We could be adversely affected if we are unable to recover portions of commodity (including costs of steel and other raw materials), labor, transportation and energy costs from our customers. Commodity, labor, transportation and energy costs have risen sharply over the past year creating pressure on our profit margins. We continue to work with our customers to recover a portion of our material cost increases. While we have been successful in the past recovering a significant portion of such cost increases, there is no assurance that increases in commodity costs, which can be impacted by a variety of factors, including changes in trade laws and tariffs, will not adversely impact our profitability in the future. We are also experiencing ongoing labor shortages in certain geographies and increased competition for qualified candidates. These shortages could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and are increasing labor costs, which reduce our profitability. Standard freight rates have increased dramatically due to shipping container and truck driver shortages and port congestion attributable to the on-going impact of the COVID pandemic. We have also incurred significant premium freight, resulting from frequent changes in customer order patterns. If we are unable to pass labor, transportation and energy cost increases on to our customer base or otherwise mitigate the costs, our profit margin could be adversely affected. We could be adversely affected if we experience shortages of components from our suppliers or if disruptions in the supply chain lead to parts shortages for our customers. A substantial portion of our annual cost of sales is driven by the purchase of goods and services. To manage and minimize these costs, we have been consolidating our supplier base. As a result, we are dependent on single sources of supply for some components of our products. We select our suppliers based on total value (including price, delivery and quality), taking into consideration their production capacities and financial condition, and we expect that they will be able to support our needs. However, there is no assurance that adverse financial conditions, including bankruptcies of our suppliers, reduced levels of production, natural disasters or other problems experienced by our suppliers will not result in shortages or delays in their supply of components to us or even in the financial collapse of one or more such suppliers. If we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers, particularly those who are sole sources, and were unable to procure the components from other sources, we would be unable to meet our production schedules for some of our key products and to ship such products to our customers in a timely fashion, which would adversely affect our sales, profitability and customer relations. Adverse economic conditions, natural disasters and other factors can similarly lead to financial distress or production problems for other suppliers to our customers which can create disruptions to our production levels. Any such supply-chain induced disruptions to our production are likely to create operating inefficiencies that will adversely affect our sales, profitability and customer relations. Our profitability and results of operations may be adversely affected by program launch difficulties. The launch of new business is a complex process, the success of which depends on a wide range of factors, including the production readiness of our manufacturing facilities and manufacturing processes and those of our suppliers, as well as factors related to tooling, equipment, employees, initial product quality and other factors. Our failure to successfully launch material new or takeover business could have an adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.        9     Table of Contents We use important intellectual property in our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected. We own important intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements. Our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve. Our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license. Further, as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the protection of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases, despite efforts we undertake to protect them. Developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights, and any inability to protect these rights, could have a material adverse impact on our business and our competitive position. We could encounter unexpected difficulties integrating acquisitions and joint ventures. We acquired businesses in recent years, and we may complete additional acquisitions and investments in the future that complement or expand our businesses. The success of this strategy will depend on our ability to successfully complete these transactions or arrangements, to integrate the businesses acquired in these transactions and to develop satisfactory working arrangements with our strategic partners in the joint ventures. We could encounter unexpected difficulties in completing these transactions and integrating the acquisitions with our existing operations. We also may not realize the degree or timing of benefits anticipated when we entered into a transaction. Several of our joint ventures operate pursuant to established agreements and, as such, we do not unilaterally control the joint venture. There is a risk that the partners’ objectives for the joint venture may not be aligned with ours, leading to potential differences over management of the joint venture that could adversely impact its financial performance and consequent contribution to our earnings. Additionally, inability on the part of our partners to satisfy their contractual obligations under the agreements could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. We could be adversely impacted by the costs of environmental, health, safety and product liability compliance. Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries that govern emissions to the air; discharges to water; the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials; and the cleanup of contaminated properties. Historically, environmental costs related to our former and existing operations have not been material. However, there is no assurance that the costs of complying with current environmental laws and regulations, or those that may be adopted in the future, will not increase and adversely impact us. There is also no assurance that the costs of complying with current laws and regulations, or those that may be adopted in the future, that relate to health, safety and product liability matters will not adversely impact us. There is also a risk of warranty and product liability claims, as well as product recalls, if our products fail to perform to specifications or cause property damage, injury or death. (See Notes 16 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on product liabilities and warranties.) A failure of our information technology infrastructure could adversely impact our business and operations. We recognize the increasing volume of cyber attacks and employ commercially practical efforts to provide reasonable assurance that the risks of such attacks are appropriately mitigated. Each year, we evaluate the threat profile of our industry to stay abreast of trends and to provide reasonable assurance our existing countermeasures will address any new threats identified. Despite our implementation of security measures, our IT systems and those of our service providers are vulnerable to circumstances beyond our reasonable control including acts of terror, acts of government, natural disasters, civil unrest and denial of service attacks which may lead to the theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or business disruption. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers, suppliers and employees, lead to claims against the company and ultimately harm our business. Additionally, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future. We participate in certain multi-employer pension plans which are not fully funded. We contribute to certain multi-employer defined benefit pension plans for certain of our union-represented employees in the U.S. in accordance with our collective bargaining agreements. Contributions are based on hours worked except in cases of layoff or leave where we generally contribute based on 40 hours per week for a maximum of one year. The plans are not fully funded as of December 31, 2021. We could be held liable to the plans for our obligation, as well as those of other employers, due to our participation in the plans. Contribution rates could increase if the plans are required to adopt a funding improvement plan, if the performance of plan assets does not meet expectations or as a result of future collectively bargained wage and benefit agreements. (See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on multi-employer pension plans.) Changes in interest rates and asset returns could increase our pension funding obligations and reduce our profitability. We have unfunded obligations under certain of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The valuation of our future payment obligations under the plans and the related plan assets are subject to significant adverse changes if the credit and capital markets cause interest rates and projected rates of return to decline.  Such declines could also require us to make significant additional contributions to our pension plans in the future. A material increase in the unfunded obligations of these plans could also result in a significant increase in our pension expense in the future.        10     Table of Contents We may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure. Our provision for income taxes and the cash outlays required to satisfy our income tax obligations in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors. These factors include changes in the level of earnings in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in our plans to repatriate the earnings of our non-U.S. operations to the U.S. and changes in tax laws and regulations. Our income tax returns are subject to examination by federal, state and local tax authorities in the U.S. and tax authorities outside the U.S. The results of these examinations and the ongoing assessments of our tax exposures could also have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and the cash outlays required to satisfy our income tax obligations. Our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited. Net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) approximating $106 were available at December 31, 2021 to reduce future U.S. income tax liabilities. Our ability to utilize these NOLs may be limited as a result of certain change of control provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Code). The NOLs are treated as losses incurred before the change of control in January 2008 and are limited to annual utilization of $84. There can be no assurance that trading in our shares will not effect another change in control under the Code, which could further limit our ability to utilize our available NOLs. Such limitations may cause us to pay income taxes earlier and in greater amounts than would be the case if the NOLs were not subject to limitation. An inability to provide products with the technology required to satisfy customer requirements would adversely impact our ability to successfully compete in our markets. The vehicular markets in which we operate are undergoing significant technological change, with increasing focus on electrified and autonomous vehicles. These and other technological advances could render certain of our products obsolete. Maintaining our competitive position is dependent on our ability to develop commercially-viable products and services that support the future technologies embraced by our customers. Failure to appropriately anticipate and react to the cyclical and volatile nature of production rates and customer demands in our business can adversely impact our results of operations. Our financial performance is directly related to production levels of our customers. In several of our markets, customer production levels are prone to significant cyclicality, influenced by general economic conditions, changing consumer preferences, regulatory changes, and other factors. Oftentimes the rapidity of the downcycles and upcycles can be severe. Successfully executing operationally during periods of extreme downward and upward demand pressures can be challenging. Our inability to recognize and react appropriately to the production cycles inherent in our markets can adversely impact our operating results. Our continued success is dependent on being able to retain and attract requisite talent. Sustaining and growing our business requires that we continue to retain, develop and attract people with the requisite skills. With the vehicles of the future expected to undergo significant technological change, having qualified people savvy in the right technologies will be a key factor in our ability to develop the products necessary to successfully compete in the future. As a global organization, we are also dependent on our ability to attract and maintain a diverse work force that is fully engaged supporting our company’s objectives and initiatives. Failure to maintain effective internal controls could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Regulatory provisions governing the financial reporting of U.S. public companies require that we maintain effective disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting across our operations in 32 countries. Effective internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance of compliance, and, as such, they can be susceptible to human error, circumvention or override, and fraud. Failure to maintain adequate, effective internal controls could result in potential financial misstatements or other forms of noncompliance that have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or organizational reputation.        11     Table of Contents Our working capital requirements may negatively affect our liquidity. Our working capital requirements can vary significantly, depending in part on the level, variability and timing of our customers’ orders and production schedules and availability of raw materials and components from our suppliers. As production volumes increase, our working capital requirements to support the higher volumes generally increase. During 2021, the COVID pandemic continued to negatively impact the global supply chains in which we participate, necessitating that we carry significantly higher levels of inventory to satisfy customer demand. If our working capital needs exceed our cash flows from operations, we look to our cash and marketable securities balances and unused capacity of our Revolving Facility to satisfy those needs, as well as other potential sources of additional capital, which may not be available on satisfactory terms or in adequate amounts. Developments in the financial markets or downgrades to Dana's credit rating could restrict our access to capital and increase financing costs. At December 31, 2021, Dana had consolidated debt obligations of $2,443, with cash and marketable securities of $285 and unused revolving credit capacity of $1,129. Our ability to grow the business and satisfy debt service obligations is dependent, in part, on our ability to gain access to capital at competitive costs. External factors beyond our control can adversely affect capital markets – either tightening availability of capital or increasing the cost of available capital. Failure on our part to maintain adequate financial performance and appropriate credit metrics can also affect our ability to access capital at competitive prices. Increased scrutiny from the public, investors, and others regarding our environmental, social, and governance (""ESG"") practices could impact our reputation. We have a board committee and an executive officer position with responsibility for sustainability, additional dedicated employee resources, a cross-functional/business sustainability leadership team to further develop and implement an enterprise-wide sustainability strategy, and we have published a sustainability report. Our sustainability report includes our policies and practices on a variety of ESG matters, including the value creation opportunities provided by our products; diversity, equity, and inclusion; employee health and safety; community giving; and human capital management. These efforts may result in increased investor, media, employee, and other stakeholder attention to such initiatives, and such stakeholders may not be satisfied with our ESG practices or initiatives. Additionally, organizations that inform investors on ESG matters have developed rating systems for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG. Unfavorable ratings may lead to negative investor sentiment, which could negatively impact our stock price. Any failure, or perceived failure, to respond to ESG concerns could harm our business and reputation. Risk Factors
 Related to our Securities Provisions in our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may discourage a takeover attempt. Certain provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, as well as the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Dana. Such provisions, including those governing the nomination of directors, limiting who may call special stockholders’ meetings and eliminating stockholder action by written consent, may make it more difficult for other persons, without the approval of our board of directors, to make a tender offer or otherwise acquire substantial amounts of common stock or to launch other takeover attempts that a stockholder might consider to be in such stockholder’s best interest.        12     Table of Contents "
8,DAN,DANA INC,2021-02-18,"Risk Factors
 We are impacted by events and conditions that affect the light vehicle, medium/heavy vehicle and off-highway markets that we serve, as well as by factors specific to Dana. Among the risks that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations are the following, many of which are interrelated. Risk Factors
 Related to the Markets We Serve A downturn in the global economy could have a substantial adverse effect on our business. Our business is tied to general economic and industry conditions as demand for vehicles depends largely on the strength of the economy, employment levels, consumer confidence levels, the availability and cost of credit and the cost of fuel. These factors have had and could continue to have a substantial impact on our business. Certain political developments occurring the past several years have provided increased economic uncertainty. The United Kingdom’s (UK) 2016 decision to exit the European Union (EU) has not had significant economic ramifications on our operations to date. The UK and the EU have announced the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) which covers the future UK – EU relationship. The TCA is being provisionally applied beginning January 1, 2021 pending approval in the Council of the EU and European Parliament. The longer term economic, legal, political, and social implications of the TCA are unclear at this stage. Political climate changes in the U.S., including tax reform legislation, regulatory requirements and potential trade policy actions, are likely to impact economic conditions in the U.S. and various countries, the cost of importing into the U.S. and the competitive landscape of our customers, suppliers and competitors. Adverse global economic conditions could also cause our customers and suppliers to experience severe economic constraints in the future, including bankruptcy, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by climate change, natural catastrophes or public health crises, in the locations in which we, our customers or our suppliers operate. A natural disaster could disrupt our operations, or our customers’ or suppliers’ operations and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Although we have continuity plans designed to mitigate the impact of natural disasters on our operations, those plans may be insufficient, and any catastrophe may disrupt our ability to manufacture and deliver products to our customers, resulting in an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Also, climate change poses both regulatory and physical risks that could harm our results of operations or affect the way we conduct our businesses. For example, new or modified regulations could require us to spend substantial funds to enhance our environmental compliance efforts. In addition, our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, which could harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer. The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has had an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted our operations as well as those of our customers, suppliers and the global supply chains in which we participate, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial performance, including our ability to execute our near-term and long-term operational, strategic and capital structure initiatives, will depend on future developments, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in response to government mandates or recommendations, rapid dissipation of customer demand, as well as decisions we have made to protect the health and safety of our employees and communities, we temporarily closed a significant number of our facilities globally during 2020. We may face facility closure requirements and other operational restrictions with respect to some or all of our locations for prolonged periods of time due to, among other factors, evolving and increasingly stringent governmental restrictions including public health directives, quarantine policies or social distancing measures. We operate as part of the complex integrated global supply chains of our largest customers. As the COVID-19 pandemic dissipates at varying times and rates in different regions around the world, there could be a prolonged negative impact on these global supply chains. Our ability to continue operations at specific facilities will be impacted by the interdependencies of the various participants of these global supply chains, which are largely beyond our direct control. A prolonged shut down of these global supply chains will have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Consumer spending may also be negatively impacted by general macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence, including the impacts of any recession, resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. This may negatively impact the markets we serve and may cause our customers to purchase fewer products from us. Any significant reduction in demand caused by decreased consumer confidence and spending following the pandemic, would result in a loss of sales and profits and other material adverse effects. Rising interest rates could have a substantial adverse effect on our business Rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity, the financial condition of our customers and the financial condition of the end customers who ultimately create demand for the products we supply, all of which could negatively affect demand for our products. An increase in interest rates could make it difficult for us to obtain financing at attractive rates, impacting our ability to execute on our growth strategies or future acquisitions.        7     Table of Contents  We could be adversely impacted by the loss of any of our significant customers, changes in their requirements for our products or changes in their financial condition. We are reliant upon sales to several significant customers. Sales to our ten largest customers accounted for 54% of our overall sales in 2020. Changes in our business relationships with any of our large customers or in the timing, size and continuation of their various programs could have a material adverse impact on us. The loss of any of these customers, the loss of business with respect to one or more of their vehicle models on which we have high component content, or a significant decline in the production levels of such vehicles would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Pricing pressure from our customers also poses certain risks. Inability on our part to offset pricing concessions with cost reductions would adversely affect our profitability. We are continually bidding on new business with these customers, as well as seeking to diversify our customer base, but there is no assurance that our efforts will be successful. Further, to the extent that the financial condition of our largest customers deteriorates, including possible bankruptcies, mergers or liquidations, or their sales otherwise decline, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected. We may be adversely impacted by changes in international legislative and political conditions. We operate in 33 countries around the world and we depend on significant foreign suppliers and customers. Further, we have several growth initiatives that are targeting emerging markets like China and India. Legislative and political activities within the countries where we conduct business, particularly in emerging markets and less developed countries, could adversely impact our ability to operate in those countries. The political situation in a number of countries in which we operate could create instability in our contractual relationships with no effective legal safeguards for resolution of these issues, or potentially result in the seizure of our assets. We operate in Argentina, where trade-related initiatives and other government restrictions limit our ability to optimize operating effectiveness. At December 31, 2020, our net asset exposure related to Argentina was approximately $21, including $5 of net fixed assets. We may be adversely impacted by changes in trade policies and proposed or imposed tariffs, including but not limited to, the imposition of new tariffs by the U.S. government on imports to the U.S. and/or the imposition of retaliatory tariffs by foreign countries. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (the Trade Act), gives the executive branch of the U.S. government broad authority to restrict imports in the interest of national security by imposing tariffs. Tariffs imposed on imported steel and aluminum could raise the costs associated with manufacturing our products. We work with our customers to recover a portion of any increased costs, and with our suppliers to defray costs, associated with tariffs. While we have been successful in the past recovering a significant portion of costs increases, there is no assurance that cost increases resulting from trade policies and tariffs will not adversely impact our profitability. Our sales may also be adversely impacted if tariffs are assessed directly on the products we produce or on our customers’ products containing content sourced from us.        8     Table of Contents We may be adversely impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies in the other countries in which we do business. Approximately 52% of our sales in 2020 were from operations located in countries other than the U.S. Currency variations can have an impact on our results (expressed in U.S. dollars). Currency variations can also adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the U.S. and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from affiliates or other suppliers located outside of the U.S. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and currencies of other countries in which we have operations could have an adverse effect on our results reported in U.S. dollars. We use a combination of natural hedging techniques and financial derivatives to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risks. Such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations. We may be adversely impacted by new laws, regulations or policies of governmental organizations related to increased fuel economy standards and reduced greenhouse gas emissions, or changes in existing ones. The markets and customers we serve are subject to substantial government regulation, which often differs by state, region and country. These regulations, and proposals for additional regulation, are advanced primarily out of concern for the environment (including concerns about global climate change and its impact) and energy independence. We anticipate that the number and extent of these regulations, and the costs to comply with them, will increase significantly in the future. In the U.S., vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions are regulated under a harmonized national program administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Other governments in the markets we serve are also creating new policies to address these same issues, including the European Union, Brazil, China and India. These government regulatory requirements could significantly affect our customers by altering their global product development plans and substantially increasing their costs, which could result in limitations on the types of vehicles they sell and the geographical markets they serve. Any of these outcomes could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. The proposed phase out of the London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) could have an adverse effect on our business Our revolving credit facility (the ""Revolving Facility"") and term loan B facility (the ""Term B Facility"") utilize Libor to set the interest rate on any outstanding borrowings.  In July 2017, the head of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced the desire to phase out the use of Libor by the end of 2021. On November 30, 2020 the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (IBA) announced that it will consult on its intention to cease publication of the one week and two-month USD Libor settings at the end of 2021 and the remaining USD Libor settings at the end of June 2023. The potential effect on our cost of borrowing utilizing a replacement rate cannot yet be determined. In addition, any further changes or reforms to the determination of Libor or its successor rate may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease on our borrowing rate, which could have an adverse impact on extension of credit held by us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Company-Specific Risk Factors
 We have taken, and continue to take, cost-reduction actions. Although our process includes planning for potential negative consequences, the cost-reduction actions may expose us to additional production risk and could adversely affect our sales, profitability and ability to retain and attract employees. We have been reducing costs in all of our businesses and have discontinued product lines, exited businesses, consolidated manufacturing operations and positioned operations in lower cost locations. The impact of these cost-reduction actions on our sales and profitability may be influenced by many factors including our ability to successfully complete these ongoing efforts, our ability to generate the level of cost savings we expect or that are necessary to enable us to effectively compete, delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, decline in employee morale and the potential inability to meet operational targets due to our inability to retain or recruit key employees. We depend on our subsidiaries for cash to satisfy the obligations of the company. Our subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and own substantially all of our assets. Our cash flow and our ability to meet our obligations depend on the cash flow of our subsidiaries. In addition, the payment of funds in the form of dividends, intercompany payments, tax sharing payments and otherwise may be subject to restrictions under the laws of the countries of incorporation of our subsidiaries or the by-laws of the subsidiary. Labor stoppages or work slowdowns at Dana, key suppliers or our customers could result in a disruption in our operations and have a material adverse effect on our businesses. We and our customers rely on our respective suppliers to provide parts needed to maintain production levels. We all rely on workforces represented by labor unions. Workforce disputes that result in work stoppages or slowdowns could disrupt operations of all of these businesses, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the supply of, or demand for, the products we supply our customers.        9     Table of Contents We could be adversely affected if we are unable to recover portions of commodity costs (including costs of steel, other raw materials and energy) from our customers. We continue to work with our customers to recover a portion of our material cost increases. While we have been successful in the past recovering a significant portion of such cost increases, there is no assurance that increases in commodity costs, which can be impacted by a variety of factors, including changes in trade laws and tariffs, will not adversely impact our profitability in the future. We could be adversely affected if we experience shortages of components from our suppliers or if disruptions in the supply chain lead to parts shortages for our customers. A substantial portion of our annual cost of sales is driven by the purchase of goods and services. To manage and minimize these costs, we have been consolidating our supplier base. As a result, we are dependent on single sources of supply for some components of our products.

If we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers, particularly those who are sole sources, and were unable to procure the components from other sources, we would be unable to meet our production schedules for some of our key products and to ship such products to our customers in a timely fashion, which would adversely affect our sales, profitability and customer relations. Adverse economic conditions, natural disasters and other factors can similarly lead to financial distress or production problems for other suppliers to our customers which can create disruptions to our production levels. Any such supply-chain induced disruptions to our production are likely to create operating inefficiencies that will adversely affect our sales, profitability and customer relations. Our profitability and results of operations may be adversely affected by program launch difficulties. The launch of new business is a complex process, the success of which depends on a wide range of factors, including the production readiness of our manufacturing facilities and manufacturing processes and those of our suppliers, as well as factors related to tooling, equipment, employees, initial product quality and other factors. Our failure to successfully launch material new or takeover business could have an adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations. We use important intellectual property in our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected. We own important intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements. Our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve. Our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license. Further, as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the protection of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases, despite efforts we undertake to protect them. Developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights, and any inability to protect these rights, could have a material adverse impact on our business and our competitive position. We could encounter unexpected difficulties integrating acquisitions and joint ventures. We acquired businesses in recent years, and we expect to complete additional acquisitions and investments in the future that complement or expand our businesses. The success of this strategy will depend on our ability to successfully complete these transactions or arrangements, to integrate the businesses acquired in these transactions and to develop satisfactory working arrangements with our strategic partners in the joint ventures. We could encounter unexpected difficulties in completing these transactions and integrating the acquisitions with our existing operations. We also may not realize the degree or timing of benefits anticipated when we entered into a transaction.        10     Table of Contents Several of our joint ventures operate pursuant to established agreements and, as such, we do not unilaterally control the joint venture. There is a risk that the partners’ objectives for the joint venture may not be aligned with ours, leading to potential differences over management of the joint venture that could adversely impact its financial performance and consequent contribution to our earnings. Additionally, inability on the part of our partners to satisfy their contractual obligations under the agreements could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. We could be adversely impacted by the costs of environmental, health, safety and product liability compliance. Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries that govern emissions to the air; discharges to water; the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials; and the cleanup of contaminated properties. Historically, environmental costs related to our former and existing operations have not been material. However, there is no assurance that the costs of complying with current environmental laws and regulations, or those that may be adopted in the future, will not increase and adversely impact us. There is also no assurance that the costs of complying with current laws and regulations, or those that may be adopted in the future, that relate to health, safety and product liability matters will not adversely impact us. There is also a risk of warranty and product liability claims, as well as product recalls, if our products fail to perform to specifications or cause property damage, injury or death. (See Notes 16 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on product liabilities and warranties.) A failure of our information technology infrastructure could adversely impact our business and operations. We recognize the increasing volume of cyber attacks and employ commercially practical efforts to provide reasonable assurance that the risks of such attacks are appropriately mitigated. Each year, we evaluate the threat profile of our industry to stay abreast of trends and to provide reasonable assurance our existing countermeasures will address any new threats identified. Despite our implementation of security measures, our IT systems and those of our service providers are vulnerable to circumstances beyond our reasonable control including acts of terror, acts of government, natural disasters, civil unrest and denial of service attacks which may lead to the theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or business disruption. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers, suppliers and employees, lead to claims against the company and ultimately harm our business. Additionally, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future. We participate in certain multi-employer pension plans which are not fully funded. We contribute to certain multi-employer defined benefit pension plans for certain of our union-represented employees in the U.S. in accordance with our collective bargaining agreements. Contributions are based on hours worked except in cases of layoff or leave where we generally contribute based on 40 hours per week for a maximum of one year. The plans are not fully funded as of December 31, 2020. We could be held liable to the plans for our obligation, as well as those of other employers, due to our participation in the plans. Contribution rates could increase if the plans are required to adopt a funding improvement plan, if the performance of plan assets does not meet expectations or as a result of future collectively bargained wage and benefit agreements. (See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on multi-employer pension plans.) Changes in interest rates and asset returns could increase our pension funding obligations and reduce our profitability. We have unfunded obligations under certain of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The valuation of our future payment obligations under the plans and the related plan assets are subject to significant adverse changes if the credit and capital markets cause interest rates and projected rates of return to decline.  Such declines could also require us to make significant additional contributions to our pension plans in the future. A material increase in the unfunded obligations of these plans could also result in a significant increase in our pension expense in the future. We may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure. Our provision for income taxes and the cash outlays required to satisfy our income tax obligations in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors. These factors include changes in the level of earnings in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in our plans to repatriate the earnings of our non-U.S. operations to the U.S. and changes in tax laws and regulations.        11     Table of Contents Our income tax returns are subject to examination by federal, state and local tax authorities in the U.S. and tax authorities outside the U.S. The results of these examinations and the ongoing assessments of our tax exposures could also have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and the cash outlays required to satisfy our income tax obligations. Our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited. Net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) approximating $190 were available at December 31, 2020 to reduce future U.S. income tax liabilities. Our ability to utilize these NOLs may be limited as a result of certain change of control provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Code). The NOLs are treated as losses incurred before the change of control in January 2008 and are limited to annual utilization of $84. There can be no assurance that trading in our shares will not effect another change in control under the Code, which could further limit our ability to utilize our available NOLs. Such limitations may cause us to pay income taxes earlier and in greater amounts than would be the case if the NOLs were not subject to limitation. An inability to provide products with the technology required to satisfy customer requirements would adversely impact our ability to successfully compete in our markets. The vehicular markets in which we operate are undergoing significant technological change, with increasing focus on electrified and autonomous vehicles. These and other technological advances could render certain of our products obsolete. Maintaining our competitive position is dependent on our ability to develop commercially-viable products and services that support the future technologies embraced by our customers. Failure to appropriately anticipate and react to the cyclical and volatile nature of production rates and customer demands in our business can adversely impact our results of operations. Our financial performance is directly related to production levels of our customers. In several of our markets, customer production levels are prone to significant cyclicality, influenced by general economic conditions, changing consumer preferences, regulatory changes, and other factors. Oftentimes the rapidity of the downcycles and upcycles can be severe. Successfully executing operationally during periods of extreme downward and upward demand pressures can be challenging. Our inability to recognize and react appropriately to the production cycles inherent in our markets can adversely impact our operating results. Our continued success is dependent on being able to retain and attract requisite talent. Sustaining and growing our business requires that we continue to retain, develop and attract people with the requisite skills. With the vehicles of the future expected to undergo significant technological change, having qualified people savvy in the right technologies will be a key factor in our ability to develop the products necessary to successfully compete in the future. As a global organization, we are also dependent on our ability to attract and maintain a diverse work force that is fully engaged supporting our company’s objectives and initiatives. Failure to maintain effective internal controls could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Regulatory provisions governing the financial reporting of U.S. public companies require that we maintain effective disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting across our operations in 33 countries. Effective internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance of compliance, and, as such, they can be susceptible to human error, circumvention or override, and fraud. Failure to maintain adequate, effective internal controls could result in potential financial misstatements or other forms of noncompliance that have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or organizational reputation.  Developments in the financial markets or downgrades to Dana's credit rating could restrict our access to capital and increase financing costs. At December 31, 2020, Dana had consolidated debt obligations of $2,481, with cash and marketable securities of $580 and unused revolving credit capacity of $979. Our ability to grow the business and satisfy debt service obligations is dependent, in part, on our ability to gain access to capital at competitive costs. External factors beyond our control can adversely affect capital markets – either tightening availability of capital or increasing the cost of available capital. Failure on our part to maintain adequate financial performance and appropriate credit metrics can also affect our ability to access capital at competitive prices.        12     Table of Contents  Risk Factors
 Related to our Securities Provisions in our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may discourage a takeover attempt. Certain provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, as well as the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Dana. Such provisions, including those governing the nomination of directors, limiting who may call special stockholders’ meetings and eliminating stockholder action by written consent, may make it more difficult for other persons, without the approval of our board of directors, to make a tender offer or otherwise acquire substantial amounts of common stock or to launch other takeover attempts that a stockholder might consider to be in such stockholder’s best interest. "
4,DAN,DANA INC,2020-02-14,"Risk Factors
We are impacted by events and conditions that affect the light vehicle, medium/heavy vehicle and off-highway markets that we serve, as well as by factors specific to Dana. Among the risks that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations are the following, many of which are interrelated.Risk Factors
 Related to the Markets We ServeA downturn in the global economy could have a substantial adverse effect on our business.Our business is tied to general economic and industry conditions as demand for vehicles depends largely on the strength of the economy, employment levels, consumer confidence levels, the availability and cost of credit and the cost of fuel. These factors have had and could continue to have a substantial impact on our business.We expect global market conditions in 2020 to result in overall sales that are slightly lower than 2019. We expect the North America economic climate to deteriorate as compared to 2019. The medium/heavy truck market in North America is expected to be down considerably in 2020, with Class 8 demand down over 30% and Classes 5-7 lower by approximately 10% compared to 2019. In the light vehicle market, light truck demand is expected to be comparable to slightly weaker than 2019. The economy in Europe is expected to be mixed, with off-highway market demand being down and on-highway market demand being relatively stable compared to this past year. Continued economic improvement in Brazil is expected to provide stable to improving production levels in our key South America market segments in 2020. We expect all markets in Asia Pacific to contract in 2020, as the Chinese and Indian economies continue to soften. Adverse developments in the economic conditions of any of these markets could reduce demand for new vehicles, causing our customers to reduce their vehicle production and, as a result, demand for our products would be adversely affected. Certain political developments occurring the past several years have provided increased economic uncertainty. The United Kingdom's decision in 2016 to exit the European Union has not had significant economic ramifications to date; however, transition details continue to develop and could have potential economic implications in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. Political climate changes in the U.S., including tax reform legislation, easing of regulatory requirements and potential trade policy actions, are likely to impact economic conditions in the U.S. and various countries, the cost of importing into the U.S. and the competitive landscape of our customers, suppliers and competitors. Adverse global economic conditions could also cause our customers and suppliers to experience severe economic constraints in the future, including bankruptcy, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.Our results of operations could be adversely affected by climate change, natural catastrophes or public health crises, in the locations in which we, our customers or our suppliers operate.A natural disaster could disrupt our operations, or our customers’ or suppliers’ operations and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Although we have continuity plans designed to mitigate the impact of natural disasters on our operations, those plans may be insufficient, and any catastrophe may disrupt our ability to manufacture and deliver products to our customers, resulting in an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Also, climate change poses both regulatory and physical risks that could harm our results of operations or affect the way we conduct our businesses. For example, new or modified regulations could require us to spend substantial funds to enhance our environmental compliance efforts. In addition, our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, which could harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer. For example, December 2019 and January 2020, an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus in Wuhan, China has resulted in travel disruption and has effected certain companies’ operations in China. At this point, the extent to which the coronavirus may impact our results is uncertain.Rising interest rates could have a substantial adverse effect on our businessRising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity, the financial condition of our customers and the financial condition of the end customers who ultimately create demand for the products we supply, all of which could negatively affect demand for our products. An increase in interest rates could make it difficult for us to obtain financing at attractive rates, impacting our ability to execute on our growth strategies or future acquisitions.6The proposed phase out of the London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) could have an adverse effect on our businessOur revolving credit facility and term facilities utilize LIBOR to set the interest rate on any outstanding borrowings. In July 2017, the head of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced the desire to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. There is currently no definitive information regarding the future utilization of LIBOR or of any particular replacement rate. As such, the potential effect of any such event on our cost of capital cannot yet be determined. In addition, any further changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of LIBOR may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on extensions of credit held by us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We could be adversely impacted by the loss of any of our significant customers, changes in their requirements for our products or changes in their financial condition.We are reliant upon sales to several significant customers. Sales to our ten largest customers accounted for 55% of our overall sales in 2019. Changes in our business relationships with any of our large customers or in the timing, size and continuation of their various programs could have a material adverse impact on us.The loss of any of these customers, the loss of business with respect to one or more of their vehicle models on which we have high component content, or a significant decline in the production levels of such vehicles would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Pricing pressure from our customers also poses certain risks. Inability on our part to offset pricing concessions with cost reductions would adversely affect our profitability. We are continually bidding on new business with these customers, as well as seeking to diversify our customer base, but there is no assurance that our efforts will be successful. Further, to the extent that the financial condition of our largest customers deteriorates, including possible bankruptcies, mergers or liquidations, or their sales otherwise decline, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.We may be adversely impacted by changes in international legislative and political conditions.We operate in 34 countries around the world and we depend on significant foreign suppliers and customers. Further, we have several growth initiatives that are targeting emerging markets like China and India. Legislative and political activities within the countries where we conduct business, particularly in emerging markets and less developed countries, could adversely impact our ability to operate in those countries. The political situation in a number of countries in which we operate could create instability in our contractual relationships with no effective legal safeguards for resolution of these issues, or potentially result in the seizure of our assets. We operate in Argentina, where trade-related initiatives and other government restrictions limit our ability to optimize operating effectiveness.  At December 31, 2019, our net asset exposure related to Argentina was approximately $13, including $6 of net fixed assets.We may be adversely impacted by changes in trade policies and proposed or imposed tariffs, including but not limited to, the imposition of new tariffs by the U.S. government on imports to the U.S. and/or the imposition of retaliatory tariffs by foreign countries.Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (the Trade Act), gives the executive branch of the U.S. government broad authority to restrict imports in the interest of national security by imposing tariffs. During 2018, the U.S. government concluded that imported steel and aluminum threaten to impair the national security and imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imported from certain countries. Certain foreign countries have responded with retaliatory tariffs. In 2019, the U.S. government also determined pursuant to Section 232 that U.S. imports of automobiles and certain automotive parts threaten to impair U.S. national security. The government has not imposed tariffs but has sought to negotiate bilateral agreements with the European Union and Japan. These negotiations are ongoing. Section 301 of the Trade Act gives the executive branch broad authority to impose tariffs against countries that make unjustified, unreasonable, or discriminatory trade actions. During 2018, the U.S. government concluded that China’s trade policies harm U.S. business and workers and threaten the long-term competitiveness of the U.S. and has imposed tariffs on numerous Chinese imports. China has responded with retaliatory tariffs. In January 2020, the U.S. and China signed an Economic and Trade Agreement (also known as the Phase One Agreement), while this marked a positive development, most of the key issues remain unresolved and need to be addressed in subsequent negotiations. In November 2018, the U.S., Mexico and Canada executed the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the successor agreement to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The agreement includes the imposition of tariffs on vehicles that do not meet regional raw material (steel and aluminum), part and labor content requirements. The agreement was ratified by the U.S. in January 2020. 7Tariffs imposed on imported steel and aluminum could raise the costs associated with manufacturing our products. We continue to work with our customers to recover a portion of our increased costs, and with our suppliers to defray costs, associated with these tariffs. While we have been successful in the past recovering a significant portion of costs increases, there is no assurance that cost increases resulting from trade policies and tariffs will not adversely impact our profitability. Our sales may also be adversely impacted if tariffs are assessed directly on the products we produce or on our customers’ products containing content sourced from us.We may be adversely impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies in the other countries in which we do business.Approximately 53% of our sales in 2019 were from operations located in countries other than the U.S. Currency variations can have an impact on our results (expressed in U.S. dollars). Currency variations can also adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the U.S. and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from affiliates or other suppliers located outside of the U.S. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and currencies of other countries in which we have operations has had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results reported in U.S. dollars. We use a combination of natural hedging techniques and financial derivatives to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risks. Such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations.We may be adversely impacted by new laws, regulations or policies of governmental organizations related to increased fuel economy standards and reduced greenhouse gas emissions, or changes in existing ones.The markets and customers we serve are subject to substantial government regulation, which often differs by state, region and country. These regulations, and proposals for additional regulation, are advanced primarily out of concern for the environment (including concerns about global climate change and its impact) and energy independence. We anticipate that the number and extent of these regulations, and the costs to comply with them, will increase significantly in the future.In the U.S., vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions are regulated under a harmonized national program administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Other governments in the markets we serve are also creating new policies to address these same issues, including the European Union, Brazil, China and India. These government regulatory requirements could significantly affect our customers by altering their global product development plans and substantially increasing their costs, which could result in limitations on the types of vehicles they sell and the geographical markets they serve. Any of these outcomes could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.Company-Specific Risk Factors
We have taken, and continue to take, cost-reduction actions. Although our process includes planning for potential negative consequences, the cost-reduction actions may expose us to additional production risk and could adversely affect our sales, profitability and ability to retain and attract employees.We have been reducing costs in all of our businesses and have discontinued product lines, exited businesses, consolidated manufacturing operations and positioned operations in lower cost locations. The impact of these cost-reduction actions on our sales and profitability may be influenced by many factors including our ability to successfully complete these ongoing efforts, our ability to generate the level of cost savings we expect or that are necessary to enable us to effectively compete, delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, decline in employee morale and the potential inability to meet operational targets due to our inability to retain or recruit key employees.We depend on our subsidiaries for cash to satisfy the obligations of the company.Our subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and own substantially all of our assets. Our cash flow and our ability to meet our obligations depend on the cash flow of our subsidiaries. In addition, the payment of funds in the form of dividends, intercompany payments, tax sharing payments and otherwise may be subject to restrictions under the laws of the countries of incorporation of our subsidiaries or the by-laws of the subsidiary.Labor stoppages or work slowdowns at Dana, key suppliers or our customers could result in a disruption in our operations and have a material adverse effect on our businesses.8We and our customers rely on our respective suppliers to provide parts needed to maintain production levels. We all rely on workforces represented by labor unions. Workforce disputes that result in work stoppages or slowdowns could disrupt operations of all of these businesses, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the supply of, or demand for, the products we supply our customers.We could be adversely affected if we are unable to recover portions of commodity costs (including costs of steel, other raw materials and energy) from our customers.We continue to work with our customers to recover a portion of our material cost increases. While we have been successful in the past recovering a significant portion of such cost increases, there is no assurance that increases in commodity costs, which can be impacted by a variety of factors, including changes in trade laws and tariffs, will not adversely impact our profitability in the future.We could be adversely affected if we experience shortages of components from our suppliers or if disruptions in the supply chain lead to parts shortages for our customers.A substantial portion of our annual cost of sales is driven by the purchase of goods and services. To manage and minimize these costs, we have been consolidating our supplier base. As a result, we are dependent on single sources of supply for some components of our products. We select our suppliers based on total value (including price, delivery and quality), taking into consideration their production capacities and financial condition, and we expect that they will be able to support our needs. However, there is no assurance that adverse financial conditions, including bankruptcies of our suppliers, reduced levels of production, natural disasters or other problems experienced by our suppliers will not result in shortages or delays in their supply of components to us or even in the financial collapse of one or more such suppliers. If we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers, particularly those who are sole sources, and were unable to procure the components from other sources, we would be unable to meet our production schedules for some of our key products and to ship such products to our customers in a timely fashion, which would adversely affect our sales, profitability and customer relations.Adverse economic conditions, natural disasters and other factors can similarly lead to financial distress or production problems for other suppliers to our customers which can create disruptions to our production levels. Any such supply-chain induced disruptions to our production are likely to create operating inefficiencies that will adversely affect our sales, profitability and customer relations.Our profitability and results of operations may be adversely affected by program launch difficulties.The launch of new business is a complex process, the success of which depends on a wide range of factors, including the production readiness of our manufacturing facilities and manufacturing processes and those of our suppliers, as well as factors related to tooling, equipment, employees, initial product quality and other factors. Our failure to successfully launch material new or takeover business could have an adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.We use important intellectual property in our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected.We own important intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements. Our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve. Our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license. Further, as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the protection of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases, despite efforts we undertake to protect them. Developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights, and any inability to protect these rights, could have a material adverse impact on our business and our competitive position.We could encounter unexpected difficulties integrating acquisitions and joint ventures.We acquired businesses in recent years, and we expect to complete additional acquisitions and investments in the future that complement or expand our businesses. The success of this strategy will depend on our ability to successfully complete these transactions or arrangements, to integrate the businesses acquired in these transactions and to develop satisfactory working arrangements with our strategic partners in the joint ventures. We could encounter unexpected difficulties in completing these transactions and integrating the acquisitions with our existing operations. We also may not realize the degree or timing of benefits anticipated when we entered into a transaction.9Several of our joint ventures operate pursuant to established agreements and, as such, we do not unilaterally control the joint venture. There is a risk that the partners’ objectives for the joint venture may not be aligned with ours, leading to potential differences over management of the joint venture that could adversely impact its financial performance and consequent contribution to our earnings. Additionally, inability on the part of our partners to satisfy their contractual obligations under the agreements could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.We could be adversely impacted by the costs of environmental, health, safety and product liability compliance.Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries that govern emissions to the air; discharges to water; the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials; and the cleanup of contaminated properties. Historically, environmental costs related to our former and existing operations have not been material. However, there is no assurance that the costs of complying with current environmental laws and regulations, or those that may be adopted in the future, will not increase and adversely impact us.There is also no assurance that the costs of complying with current laws and regulations, or those that may be adopted in the future, that relate to health, safety and product liability matters will not adversely impact us. There is also a risk of warranty and product liability claims, as well as product recalls, if our products fail to perform to specifications or cause property damage, injury or death. (See Notes 17 and 18 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on product liabilities and warranties.)A failure of our information technology infrastructure could adversely impact our business and operations.We recognize the increasing volume of cyber attacks and employ commercially practical efforts to provide reasonable assurance that the risks of such attacks are appropriately mitigated. Each year, we evaluate the threat profile of our industry to stay abreast of trends and to provide reasonable assurance our existing countermeasures will address any new threats identified. Despite our implementation of security measures, our IT systems and those of our service providers are vulnerable to circumstances beyond our reasonable control including acts of terror, acts of government, natural disasters, civil unrest and denial of service attacks which may lead to the theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or business disruption. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers, suppliers and employees, lead to claims against the company and ultimately harm our business. Additionally, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.We participate in certain multi-employer pension plans which are not fully funded.We contribute to certain multi-employer defined benefit pension plans for certain of our union-represented employees in the U.S. in accordance with our collective bargaining agreements. Contributions are based on hours worked except in cases of layoff or leave where we generally contribute based on 40 hours per week for a maximum of one year. The plans are not fully funded as of December 31, 2019. We could be held liable to the plans for our obligation, as well as those of other employers, due to our participation in the plans. Contribution rates could increase if the plans are required to adopt a funding improvement plan, if the performance of plan assets does not meet expectations or as a result of future collectively bargained wage and benefit agreements. (See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on multi-employer pension plans.)Changes in interest rates and asset returns could increase our pension funding obligations and reduce our profitability.We have unfunded obligations under certain of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The valuation of our future payment obligations under the plans and the related plan assets are subject to significant adverse changes if the credit and capital markets cause interest rates and projected rates of return to decline.  Such declines could also require us to make significant additional contributions to our pension plans in the future. A material increase in the unfunded obligations of these plans could also result in a significant increase in our pension expense in the future.We may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.Our provision for income taxes and the cash outlays required to satisfy our income tax obligations in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors. These factors include changes in the level of earnings in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in our plans to repatriate the earnings of our non-U.S. operations to the U.S. and changes in tax laws and regulations. 10In December 2017, the U.S. introduced broad ranging tax reform with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""Act"") legislation. Among the tax reforms was a reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.  Although the tax reform in the U.S. reduced the statutory tax rate to 21% for 2018, the effects of the lower rate were offset in part by the effects of increased nondeductible expenses and the global intangible low taxed income (“GILTI”) provisions which result in a certain amount of foreign earnings being subjected to U.S. tax. Considering the exclusion of foreign subsidiary dividends from taxation in the U.S., we believe the Act will provide some greater flexibility to repatriate future earnings of our foreign operations.Our income tax returns are subject to examination by federal, state and local tax authorities in the U.S. and tax authorities outside the U.S. The results of these examinations and the ongoing assessments of our tax exposures could also have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and the cash outlays required to satisfy our income tax obligations.Our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited.Net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) approximating $281 were available at December 31, 2019 to reduce future U.S. income tax liabilities. Our ability to utilize these NOLs may be limited as a result of certain change of control provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Code). The NOLs are treated as losses incurred before the change of control in January 2008 and are limited to annual utilization of $84. There can be no assurance that trading in our shares will not effect another change in control under the Code, which could further limit our ability to utilize our available NOLs. Such limitations may cause us to pay income taxes earlier and in greater amounts than would be the case if the NOLs were not subject to limitation.An inability to provide products with the technology required to satisfy customer requirements would adversely impact our ability to successfully compete in our markets.The vehicular markets in which we operate are undergoing significant technological change, with increasing focus on electrified and autonomous vehicles. These and other technological advances could render certain of our products obsolete. Maintaining our competitive position is dependent on our ability to develop commercially-viable products and services that support the future technologies embraced by our customers.Failure to appropriately anticipate and react to the cyclical and volatile nature of production rates and customer demands in our business can adversely impact our results of operations.Our financial performance is directly related to production levels of our customers. In several of our markets, customer production levels are prone to significant cyclicality, influenced by general economic conditions, changing consumer preferences, regulatory changes, and other factors. Oftentimes the rapidity of the downcycles and upcycles can be severe. Successfully executing operationally during periods of extreme downward and upward demand pressures can be challenging. Our inability to recognize and react appropriately to the production cycles inherent in our markets can adversely impact our operating results.Our continued success is dependent on being able to retain and attract requisite talent.Sustaining and growing our business requires that we continue to retain, develop and attract people with the requisite skills. With the vehicles of the future expected to undergo significant technological change, having qualified people savvy in the right technologies will be a key factor in our ability to develop the products necessary to successfully compete in the future. As a global organization, we are also dependent on our ability to attract and maintain a diverse work force that is fully engaged supporting our company’s objectives and initiatives.Failure to maintain effective internal controls could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.Regulatory provisions governing the financial reporting of U.S. public companies require that we maintain effective disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting across our operations in 34 countries. Effective internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance of compliance, and, as such, they can be susceptible to human error, circumvention or override, and fraud. Failure to maintain adequate, effective internal controls could result in potential financial misstatements or other forms of noncompliance that have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or organizational reputation. Our 2019 acquisitions were exempt from certain regulatory internal control compliance requirements this past year, but are required to be compliant in 2020.11Developments in the financial markets or downgrades to Dana's credit rating could restrict our access to capital and increase financing costs.At December 31, 2019, Dana had consolidated debt obligations of $2,398, with cash and marketable securities of $527 and unused revolving credit capacity of $979. Our ability to grow the business and satisfy debt service obligations is dependent, in part, on our ability to gain access to capital at competitive costs. External factors beyond our control can adversely affect capital markets – either tightening availability of capital or increasing the cost of available capital. Failure on our part to maintain adequate financial performance and appropriate credit metrics can also affect our ability to access capital at competitive prices. Risk Factors
 Related to our SecuritiesProvisions in our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may discourage a takeover attempt.Certain provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, as well as the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Dana. Such provisions, including those governing the nomination of directors, limiting who may call special stockholders’ meetings and eliminating stockholder action by written consent, may make it more difficult for other persons, without the approval of our board of directors, to make a tender offer or otherwise acquire substantial amounts of common stock or to launch other takeover attempts that a stockholder might consider to be in such stockholder’s best interest"

We are impacted by events and conditions that affect the light vehicle, medium/heavy vehicle and off-highway markets that we serve, as well as by factors specific to Dana. Among the risks that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations are the following, many of which are interrelated.Risk Factors
 Related to the Markets We ServeA downturn in the global economy could have a substantial adverse effect on our business.Our business is tied to general economic and industry conditions as demand for vehicles depends largely on the strength of the economy, employment levels, consumer confidence levels, the availability and cost of credit and the cost of fuel. These factors have had and could continue to have a substantial impact on our business.We expect global market conditions in 2019 to result in overall sales that are comparable to 2018. We expect the North America economic climate will be down modestly from its 2018 peak. The medium/heavy truck market in North America is expected to be mixed in 2019 with Class 8 demand stable to modestly up and Classes 5-7 down compared to 2018. In the light vehicle market, light truck demand is expected to be comparable to slightly weaker than 2018. The economy in Europe is expected to improve modestly, with both off-highway and on-highway market demand showing modest improvement compared to this past year. Continued economic improvement in Brazil is expected to provide stable to improving production levels in our key South America market segments in 2019. We expect the rate of growth in Asia Pacific to be modest in 2019, with the off-highway and light truck markets being comparable to up slightly compared to 2018, while the 2019 medium/heavy truck market is expected to be somewhat weaker. Adverse developments in the economic conditions of any of these markets could reduce demand for new vehicles, causing our customers to reduce their vehicle production and, as a result, demand for our products would be adversely affected. Certain political developments occurring the past three years have provided increased economic uncertainty. The United Kingdom's decision in 2016 to exit the European Union has not had significant economic ramifications to date; however, transition details continue to develop and could have potential economic implications in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. Political climate changes in the U.S., including tax reform legislation, easing of regulatory requirements and potential trade policy actions, are likely to impact economic conditions in the U.S. and various countries, the cost of importing into the U.S. and the competitive landscape of our customers, suppliers and competitors. Adverse global economic conditions could also cause our customers and suppliers to experience severe economic constraints in the future, including bankruptcy, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.Rising interest rates could have a substantial adverse effect on our businessIn a number of markets, including the U.S., we have seen interest rates rise after years of historically low rates. Rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity, the financial condition of our customers and the financial condition of the end customers who ultimately create demand for the products we supply, all of which could negatively affect demand for our products. An increase in interest rates could also make it difficult for us to obtain financing at attractive rates, impacting our ability to execute on our growth strategies or future acquisitions.The proposed phase out of the London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) could have an adverse effect on our businessOur revolving credit facility, current term loan and committed financing associated with our acquisition of the Drive Systems segment of the Oerlikon Group utilize LIBOR to set the interest rate on any outstanding borrowings. In July 2017, the head of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced the desire to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. There is currently no definitive information regarding the future utilization of LIBOR or of any particular replacement rate. As such, the potential effect of any such event on our cost of capital cannot yet be determined. In addition, any further changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of LIBOR may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on extensions of credit held by us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We could be adversely impacted by the loss of any of our significant customers, changes in their requirements for our products or changes in their financial condition.6We are reliant upon sales to several significant customers. Sales to our ten largest customers accounted for 58% of our overall sales in 2018. Changes in our business relationships with any of our large customers or in the timing, size and continuation of their various programs could have a material adverse impact on us.The loss of any of these customers, the loss of business with respect to one or more of their vehicle models on which we have high component content, or a significant decline in the production levels of such vehicles would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Pricing pressure from our customers also poses certain risks. Inability on our part to offset pricing concessions with cost reductions would adversely affect our profitability. We are continually bidding on new business with these customers, as well as seeking to diversify our customer base, but there is no assurance that our efforts will be successful. Further, to the extent that the financial condition of our largest customers deteriorates, including possible bankruptcies, mergers or liquidations, or their sales otherwise decline, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.We may be adversely impacted by changes in international legislative and political conditions.We operate in 33 countries around the world and we depend on significant foreign suppliers and customers. Further, we have several growth initiatives that are targeting emerging markets like China and India. Legislative and political activities within the countries where we conduct business, particularly in emerging markets and less developed countries, could adversely impact our ability to operate in those countries. The political situation in a number of countries in which we operate could create instability in our contractual relationships with no effective legal safeguards for resolution of these issues, or potentially result in the seizure of our assets. We operate in Argentina, where trade-related initiatives and other government restrictions limit our ability to optimize operating effectiveness.  At December 31, 2018, our net asset exposure related to Argentina was approximately $20, including $7 of net fixed assets.We may be adversely impacted by changes in trade policies and proposed or imposed tariffs, including but not limited to, the imposition of new tariffs by the U.S. government on imports to the U.S. and/or the imposition of retaliatory tariffs by foreign countries.Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (the Trade Act), gives the executive branch of the U.S. government broad authority to restrict imports in the interest of national security by imposing tariffs. During 2018, the U.S. government concluded that imported steel and aluminum threaten to impair the national security and imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imported from certain countries. Certain foreign countries have responded with retaliatory tariffs. The U.S. government is currently investigating imported passenger vehicles and automotive parts to determine if they are weakening our internal economy and may impair national security. Section 301 of the Trade Act gives the executive branch broad authority to impose tariffs against countries that make unjustified, unreasonable, or discriminatory trade actions. During 2018, the U.S. government concluded that China’s trade policies harm U.S. business and workers and threaten the long-term competitiveness of the U.S. and has imposed tariffs on numerous Chinese imports. China has responded with retaliatory tariffs. In November 2018, the U.S., Mexico and Canada executed the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the successor agreement to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The agreement submitted for ratification includes the imposition of tariffs on vehicles that do not meet regional raw material (steel and aluminum), part and labor content requirements.Tariffs imposed on imported steel and aluminum could raise the costs associated with manufacturing our products. We continue to work with our customers to recover a portion of our increased costs, and with our suppliers to defray costs, associated with these tariffs. While we have been successful in the past recovering a significant portion of costs increases, there is no assurance that cost increases resulting from trade policies and tariffs will not adversely impact our profitability. Our sales may also be adversely impacted if tariffs are assessed directly on the products we produce or on our customers’ products containing content sourced from us.We may be adversely impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies in the other countries in which we do business.Approximately 56% of our sales in 2018 were from operations located in countries other than the U.S. Currency variations can have an impact on our results (expressed in U.S. dollars). Currency variations can also adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the U.S. and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from affiliates or other suppliers located outside of the U.S. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and currencies of other countries in which we have operations has had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results reported in U.S. dollars. We use a combination of natural hedging techniques and financial derivatives to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risks. Such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations.7We may be adversely impacted by new laws, regulations or policies of governmental organizations related to increased fuel economy standards and reduced greenhouse gas emissions, or changes in existing ones.The markets and customers we serve are subject to substantial government regulation, which often differs by state, region and country. These regulations, and proposals for additional regulation, are advanced primarily out of concern for the environment (including concerns about global climate change and its impact) and energy independence. We anticipate that the number and extent of these regulations, and the costs to comply with them, will increase significantly in the future.In the U.S., vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions are regulated under a harmonized national program administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Other governments in the markets we serve are also creating new policies to address these same issues, including the European Union, Brazil, China and India. These government regulatory requirements could significantly affect our customers by altering their global product development plans and substantially increasing their costs, which could result in limitations on the types of vehicles they sell and the geographical markets they serve. Any of these outcomes could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.Company-Specific Risk Factors
We have taken, and continue to take, cost-reduction actions. Although our process includes planning for potential negative consequences, the cost-reduction actions may expose us to additional production risk and could adversely affect our sales, profitability and ability to retain and attract employees.We have been reducing costs in all of our businesses and have discontinued product lines, exited businesses, consolidated manufacturing operations and positioned operations in lower cost locations. The impact of these cost-reduction actions on our sales and profitability may be influenced by many factors including our ability to successfully complete these ongoing efforts, our ability to generate the level of cost savings we expect or that are necessary to enable us to effectively compete, delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, decline in employee morale and the potential inability to meet operational targets due to our inability to retain or recruit key employees.We depend on our subsidiaries for cash to satisfy the obligations of the company.Our subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and own substantially all of our assets. Our cash flow and our ability to meet our obligations depend on the cash flow of our subsidiaries. In addition, the payment of funds in the form of dividends, intercompany payments, tax sharing payments and otherwise may be subject to restrictions under the laws of the countries of incorporation of our subsidiaries or the by-laws of the subsidiary.Labor stoppages or work slowdowns at Dana, key suppliers or our customers could result in a disruption in our operations and have a material adverse effect on our businesses.We and our customers rely on our respective suppliers to provide parts needed to maintain production levels. We all rely on workforces represented by labor unions. Workforce disputes that result in work stoppages or slowdowns could disrupt operations of all of these businesses, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the supply of, or demand for, the products we supply our customers.We could be adversely affected if we are unable to recover portions of commodity costs (including costs of steel, other raw materials and energy) from our customers.We continue to work with our customers to recover a portion of our material cost increases. While we have been successful in the past recovering a significant portion of such cost increases, there is no assurance that increases in commodity costs, which can be impacted by a variety of factors, including changes in trade laws and tariffs, will not adversely impact our profitability in the future.We could be adversely affected if we experience shortages of components from our suppliers or if disruptions in the supply chain lead to parts shortages for our customers.A substantial portion of our annual cost of sales is driven by the purchase of goods and services. To manage and minimize these costs, we have been consolidating our supplier base. As a result, we are dependent on single sources of supply for some components of our products. We select our suppliers based on total value (including price, delivery and quality), taking into 8consideration their production capacities and financial condition, and we expect that they will be able to support our needs. However, there is no assurance that adverse financial conditions, including bankruptcies of our suppliers, reduced levels of production, natural disasters or other problems experienced by our suppliers will not result in shortages or delays in their supply of components to us or even in the financial collapse of one or more such suppliers. If we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers, particularly those who are sole sources, and were unable to procure the components from other sources, we would be unable to meet our production schedules for some of our key products and to ship such products to our customers in a timely fashion, which would adversely affect our sales, profitability and customer relations.Adverse economic conditions, natural disasters and other factors can similarly lead to financial distress or production problems for other suppliers to our customers which can create disruptions to our production levels. Any such supply-chain induced disruptions to our production are likely to create operating inefficiencies that will adversely affect our sales, profitability and customer relations.Our profitability and results of operations may be adversely affected by program launch difficulties.The launch of new business is a complex process, the success of which depends on a wide range of factors, including the production readiness of our manufacturing facilities and manufacturing processes and those of our suppliers, as well as factors related to tooling, equipment, employees, initial product quality and other factors. Our failure to successfully launch material new or takeover business could have an adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.We use important intellectual property in our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected.We own important intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements. Our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve. Our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license. Further, as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the protection of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases, despite efforts we undertake to protect them. Developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights, and any inability to protect these rights, could have a material adverse impact on our business and our competitive position.We could encounter unexpected difficulties integrating acquisitions and joint ventures.We acquired businesses in recent years, and we expect to complete additional acquisitions and investments in the future that complement or expand our businesses. The success of this strategy will depend on our ability to successfully complete these transactions or arrangements, to integrate the businesses acquired in these transactions and to develop satisfactory working arrangements with our strategic partners in the joint ventures. We could encounter unexpected difficulties in completing these transactions and integrating the acquisitions with our existing operations. We also may not realize the degree or timing of benefits anticipated when we entered into a transaction.Several of our joint ventures operate pursuant to established agreements and, as such, we do not unilaterally control the joint venture. There is a risk that the partners’ objectives for the joint venture may not be aligned with ours, leading to potential differences over management of the joint venture that could adversely impact its financial performance and consequent contribution to our earnings. Additionally, inability on the part of our partners to satisfy their contractual obligations under the agreements could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.We could be adversely impacted by the costs of environmental, health, safety and product liability compliance.Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries that govern emissions to the air; discharges to water; the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials; and the cleanup of contaminated properties. Historically, environmental costs related to our former and existing operations have not been material. However, there is no assurance that the costs of complying with current environmental laws and regulations, or those that may be adopted in the future, will not increase and adversely impact us.There is also no assurance that the costs of complying with current laws and regulations, or those that may be adopted in the future, that relate to health, safety and product liability matters will not adversely impact us. There is also a risk of warranty and product liability claims, as well as product recalls, if our products fail to perform to specifications or cause property 9damage, injury or death. (See Notes 16 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on product liabilities and warranties.)A failure of our information technology infrastructure could adversely impact our business and operations.We recognize the increasing volume of cyber attacks and employ commercially practical efforts to provide reasonable assurance that the risks of such attacks are appropriately mitigated. Each year, we evaluate the threat profile of our industry to stay abreast of trends and to provide reasonable assurance our existing countermeasures will address any new threats identified. Despite our implementation of security measures, our IT systems and those of our service providers are vulnerable to circumstances beyond our reasonable control including acts of terror, acts of government, natural disasters, civil unrest and denial of service attacks which may lead to the theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or business disruption. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers, suppliers and employees, lead to claims against the company and ultimately harm our business. Additionally, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.We participate in certain multi-employer pension plans which are not fully funded.We contribute to certain multi-employer defined benefit pension plans for our union-represented employees in the U.S. in accordance with our collective bargaining agreements. Contributions are based on hours worked except in cases of layoff or leave where we generally contribute based on 40 hours per week for a maximum of one year. The plans are not fully funded as of December 31, 2018. We could be held liable to the plans for our obligation, as well as those of other employers, due to our participation in the plans. Contribution rates could increase if the plans are required to adopt a funding improvement plan, if the performance of plan assets does not meet expectations or as a result of future collectively bargained wage and benefit agreements. (See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on multi-employer pension plans.)Changes in interest rates and asset returns could increase our pension funding obligations and reduce our profitability.We have unfunded obligations under certain of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The valuation of our future payment obligations under the plans and the related plan assets are subject to significant adverse changes if the credit and capital markets cause interest rates and projected rates of return to decline.  Such declines could also require us to make significant additional contributions to our pension plans in the future.  A material increase in the unfunded obligations of these plans could also result in a significant increase in our pension expense in the future.We may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.Our provision for income taxes and the cash outlays required to satisfy our income tax obligations in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors. These factors include changes in the level of earnings in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in our plans to repatriate the earnings of our non-U.S. operations to the U.S. and changes in tax laws and regulations. In December 2017, the U.S. introduced broad ranging tax reform with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""Act"") legislation. Among the tax reforms was a reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.  Although the tax reform in the U.S. reduced the statutory tax rate to 21% for 2018, the effects of the lower rate were offset in part by the effects of increased nondeductible expenses and the global intangible low taxed income (“GILTI”) provisions which result in a certain amount of foreign earnings being subjected to U.S. tax. Considering the exclusion of foreign subsidiary dividends from taxation in the U.S., we believe the Act will provide some greater flexibility to repatriate future earnings of our foreign operations.Our income tax returns are subject to examination by federal, state and local tax authorities in the U.S. and tax authorities outside the U.S. The results of these examinations and the ongoing assessments of our tax exposures could also have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and the cash outlays required to satisfy our income tax obligations.Our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited.Net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) approximating $362 were available at December 31, 2018 to reduce future U.S. income tax liabilities. Our ability to utilize these NOLs may be limited as a result of certain change of control provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Code). The NOLs are treated as losses incurred before the change of control upon emergence from Chapter 11 and are limited to annual utilization of $84. There can be no assurance that trading in our 10shares will not effect another change in control under the Code, which could further limit our ability to utilize our available NOLs. Such limitations may cause us to pay income taxes earlier and in greater amounts than would be the case if the NOLs were not subject to limitation.An inability to provide products with the technology required to satisfy customer requirements would adversely impact our ability to successfully compete in our markets.The vehicular markets in which we operate are undergoing significant technological change, with increasing focus on electrified and autonomous vehicles. These and other technological advances could render certain of our products obsolete. Maintaining our competitive position is dependent on our ability to develop commercially-viable products and services that support the future technologies embraced by our customers.Failure to appropriately anticipate and react to the cyclical and volatile nature of production rates and customer demands in our business can adversely impact our results of operations.Our financial performance is directly related to production levels of our customers. In several of our markets, customer production levels are prone to significant cyclicality, influenced by general economic conditions, changing consumer preferences, regulatory changes, and other factors. Oftentimes the rapidity of the downcycles and upcycles can be severe. Successfully executing operationally during periods of extreme downward and upward demand pressures can be challenging. Our inability to recognize and react appropriately to the production cycles inherent in our markets can adversely impact our operating results.Our continued success is dependent on being able to retain and attract requisite talent.Sustaining and growing our business requires that we continue to retain, develop and attract people with the requisite skills. With the vehicles of the future expected to undergo significant technological change, having qualified people savvy in the right technologies will be a key factor in our ability to develop the products necessary to successfully compete in the future. As a global organization, we are also dependent on our ability to attract and maintain a diverse work force that is fully engaged supporting our company’s objectives and initiatives.Failure to maintain effective internal controls could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.Regulatory provisions governing the financial reporting of U.S. public companies require that we maintain effective disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting across our operations in 33 countries. Effective internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance of compliance, and, as such, they can be susceptible to human error, circumvention or override, and fraud. Failure to maintain adequate, effective internal controls could result in potential financial misstatements or other forms of noncompliance that have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or organizational reputation. Our 2018 acquisition was exempt from certain regulatory internal control compliance requirements this past year, but is required to be compliant in 2019.Developments in the financial markets or downgrades to Dana's credit rating could restrict our access to capital and increase financing costs.At December 31, 2018, Dana had consolidated debt obligations of $1,801, with cash and marketable securities of $531 and unused revolving credit capacity of $579. Our ability to grow the business and satisfy debt service obligations is dependent, in part, on our ability to gain access to capital at competitive costs. External factors beyond our control can adversely affect capital markets – either tightening availability of capital or increasing the cost of available capital. Failure on our part to maintain adequate financial performance and appropriate credit metrics can also affect our ability to access capital at competitive prices. Risk Factors
 Related to our SecuritiesProvisions in our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may discourage a takeover attempt.Certain provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, as well as the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Dana. Such provisions, including those governing the nomination of directors, limiting who may call special stockholders’ meetings and eliminating stockholder action by written consent, may make it more difficult for other persons, without the approval of our board of 11directors, to make a tender offer or otherwise acquire substantial amounts of common stock or to launch other takeover attempts that a stockholder might consider to be in such stockholder’s best interest"
2,DAN,DANA INC,2018-02-14,"Risk Factors
We are impacted by events and conditions that affect the light vehicle, medium/heavy vehicle and off-highway markets that we serve, as well as by factors specific to Dana. Among the risks that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations are the following, many of which are interrelated.Risk Factors
 Related to the Markets We ServeFailure to sustain a continuing economic recovery in the United States and elsewhere could have a substantial adverse effect on our business.Our business is tied to general economic and industry conditions as demand for vehicles depends largely on the strength of the economy, employment levels, consumer confidence levels, the availability and cost of credit and the cost of fuel. These factors have had and could continue to have a substantial impact on our business.We expect global market conditions to result in overall comparable to slightly higher sales in 2018. We expect the North America economic climate will continue to be modestly strong to stable. The medium/heavy truck market in North America is expected to be stronger in 2018, with demand levels in the off-highway market being stable to slightly stronger. In the light vehicle market, light truck demand is expected to be comparable to slightly weaker than 2017. The economy in Europe is expected to improve modestly, with off-highway market demand continuing to improve and on-highway market demand being relatively comparable to this past year.  Continued economic improvement in Brazil is expected to provide stable to improving production levels in our key South America market segments in 2018. We expect the rate of growth in Asia Pacific to be more modest in 2018, with the off-highway and light truck markets being comparable to up slightly compared to 2017, while the 2018 medium/heavy truck market is expected to be somewhat weaker. Adverse developments in the economic conditions of any of these markets could reduce demand for new vehicles, causing our customers to reduce their vehicle production and, as a result, demand for our products would be adversely affected. Certain political developments occurring the past two years have provided increased economic uncertainty. The United Kingdom's decision in 2016 to exit the European Union has not had significant economic ramifications to date; however, transition details continue to develop and could have potential economic implications in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. Effects of the 2016 presidential election in the U.S., including recent tax reform legislation, easing of regulatory requirements and potential trade policy actions, are likely to impact economic conditions in the U.S. and various countries, the cost of importing into the U.S. and the competitive landscape of our customers, suppliers and competitors. Adverse global economic conditions could also cause our customers and suppliers to experience severe economic constraints in the future, including bankruptcy, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.We could be adversely impacted by the loss of any of our significant customers, changes in their requirements for our products or changes in their financial condition.We are reliant upon sales to several significant customers. Sales to our ten largest customers accounted for 58% of our overall sales in 2017. Changes in our business relationships with any of our large customers or in the timing, size and continuation of their various programs could have a material adverse impact on us.The loss of any of these customers, the loss of business with respect to one or more of their vehicle models on which we have high component content, or a significant decline in the production levels of such vehicles would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Pricing pressure from our customers also poses certain risks. Inability on our part to offset pricing concessions with cost reductions would adversely affect our profitability. We are continually bidding on new business with these customers, as well as seeking to diversify our customer base, but there is no assurance that our 6efforts will be successful. Further, to the extent that the financial condition of our largest customers deteriorates, including possible bankruptcies, mergers or liquidations, or their sales otherwise decline, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.We may be adversely impacted by changes in international legislative and political conditions.We operate in 33 countries around the world and we depend on significant foreign suppliers and customers. Further, we have several growth initiatives that are targeting emerging markets like China and India. Legislative and political activities within the countries where we conduct business, particularly in emerging markets and less developed countries, could adversely impact our ability to operate in those countries. The political situation in a number of countries in which we operate could create instability in our contractual relationships with no effective legal safeguards for resolution of these issues, or potentially result in the seizure of our assets. We operate in Argentina, where trade-related initiatives and other government restrictions limit our ability to optimize operating effectiveness.  At December 31, 2017, our net asset exposure related to Argentina was approximately $19, including $9 of net fixed assets.We may be adversely impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies in the other countries in which we do business.Approximately 55% of our sales in 2017 were from operations located in countries other than the U.S. Currency variations can have an impact on our results (expressed in U.S. dollars). Currency variations can also adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the U.S. and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from affiliates or other suppliers located outside of the U.S. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and currencies of other countries in which we have operations has had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results reported in U.S. dollars. We use a combination of natural hedging techniques and financial derivatives to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risks. Such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations.We may be adversely impacted by new laws, regulations or policies of governmental organizations related to increased fuel economy standards and reduced greenhouse gas emissions, or changes in existing ones.The markets and customers we serve are subject to substantial government regulation, which often differs by state, region and country. These regulations, and proposals for additional regulation, are advanced primarily out of concern for the environment (including concerns about global climate change and its impact) and energy independence. We anticipate that the number and extent of these regulations, and the costs to comply with them, will increase significantly in the future.In the U.S., vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions are regulated under a harmonized national program administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Other governments in the markets we serve are also creating new policies to address these same issues, including the European Union, Brazil, China and India. These government regulatory requirements could significantly affect our customers by altering their global product development plans and substantially increasing their costs, which could result in limitations on the types of vehicles they sell and the geographical markets they serve. Any of these outcomes could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.Company-Specific Risk Factors
We have taken, and continue to take, cost-reduction actions. Although our process includes planning for potential negative consequences, the cost-reduction actions may expose us to additional production risk and could adversely affect our sales, profitability and ability to attract and retain employees.We have been reducing costs in all of our businesses and have discontinued product lines, exited businesses, consolidated manufacturing operations and positioned operations in lower cost locations. The impact of these cost-reduction actions on our sales and profitability may be influenced by many factors including our ability to successfully complete these ongoing efforts, our ability to generate the level of cost savings we expect or that are necessary to enable us to effectively compete, delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, decline in employee morale and the potential inability to meet operational targets due to our inability to retain or recruit key employees.7We depend on our subsidiaries for cash to satisfy the obligations of the company.Our subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and own substantially all of our assets. Our cash flow and our ability to meet our obligations depend on the cash flow of our subsidiaries. In addition, the payment of funds in the form of dividends, intercompany payments, tax sharing payments and otherwise may be subject to restrictions under the laws of the countries of incorporation of our subsidiaries or the by-laws of the subsidiary.Labor stoppages or work slowdowns at Dana, key suppliers or our customers could result in a disruption in our operations and have a material adverse effect on our businesses.We and our customers rely on our respective suppliers to provide parts needed to maintain production levels. We all rely on workforces represented by labor unions. Workforce disputes that result in work stoppages or slowdowns could disrupt operations of all of these businesses, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the supply of, or demand for, the products we supply our customers.We could be adversely affected if we are unable to recover portions of commodity costs (including costs of steel, other raw materials and energy) from our customers.We continue to work with our customers to recover a portion of our material cost increases. While we have been successful in the past recovering a significant portion of such cost increases, there is no assurance that increases in commodity costs, which can be impacted by a variety of factors, including changes in trade laws and tariffs, will not adversely impact our profitability in the future.We could be adversely affected if we experience shortages of components from our suppliers or if disruptions in the supply chain lead to parts shortages for our customers.A substantial portion of our annual cost of sales is driven by the purchase of goods and services. To manage and minimize these costs, we have been consolidating our supplier base. As a result, we are dependent on single sources of supply for some components of our products. We select our suppliers based on total value (including price, delivery and quality), taking into consideration their production capacities and financial condition, and we expect that they will be able to support our needs. However, there is no assurance that adverse financial conditions, including bankruptcies of our suppliers, reduced levels of production, natural disasters or other problems experienced by our suppliers will not result in shortages or delays in their supply of components to us or even in the financial collapse of one or more such suppliers. If we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers, particularly those who are sole sources, and were unable to procure the components from other sources, we would be unable to meet our production schedules for some of our key products and to ship such products to our customers in a timely fashion, which would adversely affect our sales, profitability and customer relations.Adverse economic conditions, natural disasters and other factors can similarly lead to financial distress or production problems for other suppliers to our customers which can create disruptions to our production levels. Any such supply-chain induced disruptions to our production are likely to create operating inefficiencies that will adversely affect our sales, profitability and customer relations.Our profitability and results of operations may be adversely affected by program launch difficulties.The launch of new business is a complex process, the success of which depends on a wide range of factors, including the production readiness of our manufacturing facilities and manufacturing processes and those of our suppliers, as well as factors related to tooling, equipment, employees, initial product quality and other factors. Our failure to successfully launch material new or takeover business could have an adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.We use important intellectual property in our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected.We own important intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements. Our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve. Our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license. Further, as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the protection of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases, 8despite efforts we undertake to protect them. Developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights, and any inability to protect these rights, could have a material adverse impact on our business and our competitive position.We could encounter unexpected difficulties integrating acquisitions and joint ventures.We acquired businesses in 2017, and we expect to complete additional acquisitions and investments in the future that complement or expand our businesses. The success of this strategy will depend on our ability to successfully complete these transactions or arrangements, to integrate the businesses acquired in these transactions and to develop satisfactory working arrangements with our strategic partners in the joint ventures. We could encounter unexpected difficulties in completing these transactions and integrating the acquisitions with our existing operations. We also may not realize the degree or timing of benefits anticipated when we entered into a transaction.Several of our joint ventures operate pursuant to established agreements and, as such, we do not unilaterally control the joint venture. There is a risk that the partners’ objectives for the joint venture may not be aligned with ours, leading to potential differences over management of the joint venture that could adversely impact its financial performance and consequent contribution to our earnings. Additionally, inability on the part of our partners to satisfy their contractual obligations under the agreements could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.We could be adversely impacted by the costs of environmental, health, safety and product liability compliance.Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries that govern emissions to the air; discharges to water; the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials; and the cleanup of contaminated properties. Historically, other than an EPA settlement as part of our bankruptcy proceedings, environmental costs related to our former and existing operations have not been material. However, there is no assurance that the costs of complying with current environmental laws and regulations, or those that may be adopted in the future, will not increase and adversely impact us.There is also no assurance that the costs of complying with current laws and regulations, or those that may be adopted in the future, that relate to health, safety and product liability matters will not adversely impact us. There is also a risk of warranty and product liability claims, as well as product recalls, if our products fail to perform to specifications or cause property damage, injury or death. (See Notes 16 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on product liabilities and warranties.)A failure of our information technology infrastructure could adversely impact our business and operations.We recognize the increasing volume of cyber attacks and employ commercially practical efforts to provide reasonable assurance that the risks of such attacks are appropriately mitigated. Each year, we evaluate the threat profile of our industry to stay abreast of trends and to provide reasonable assurance our existing countermeasures will address any new threats identified. Despite our implementation of security measures, our IT systems and those of our service providers are vulnerable to circumstances beyond our reasonable control including acts of terror, acts of government, natural disasters, civil unrest and denial of service attacks which may lead to the theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or business disruption. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers, suppliers and employees, lead to claims against the company and ultimately harm our business. Additionally, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.We participate in certain multi-employer pension plans which are not fully funded.We contribute to certain multi-employer defined benefit pension plans for our union-represented employees in the U.S. in accordance with our collective bargaining agreements. Contributions are based on hours worked except in cases of layoff or leave where we generally contribute based on 40 hours per week for a maximum of one year. The plans are not fully funded as of December 31, 2017. We could be held liable to the plans for our obligation, as well as those of other employers, due to our participation in the plans. Contribution rates could increase if the plans are required to adopt a funding improvement plan, if the performance of plan assets does not meet expectations or as a result of future collectively bargained wage and benefit agreements. (See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on multi-employer pension plans.)9Changes in interest rates and asset returns could increase our pension funding obligations and reduce our profitability.We have unfunded obligations under certain of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The valuation of our future payment obligations under the plans and the related plan assets are subject to significant adverse changes if the credit and capital markets cause interest rates and projected rates of return to decline.  Such declines could also require us to make significant additional contributions to our pension plans in the future.  A material increase in the unfunded obligations of these plans could also result in a significant increase in our pension expense in the future.We may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.Our provision for income taxes and the cash outlays required to satisfy our income tax obligations in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors. These factors include changes in the level of earnings in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets, changes in our plans to repatriate the earnings of our non-U.S. operations to the U.S. and changes in tax laws and regulations. Enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the U.S. on December 22, 2017 introduced broad and complex tax reforms. With this legislation having only recently been enacted, we have had limited time to fully evaluate the impacts of these tax reforms on our business. Additionally, certain of the provisions lack clarity and will likely be subject to further interpretation by the Internal Revenue Service. As we further analyze the recent tax reform provisions and subsequent guidance, the provisional estimates of certain elements of the legislation recognized in 2017 could be impacted, and there are likely to be significant future impacts that these tax reforms will have on our future financial results and our business strategies.Our income tax returns are subject to examination by federal, state and local tax authorities in the U.S. and tax authorities outside the U.S. The results of these examinations and the ongoing assessments of our tax exposures could also have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and the cash outlays required to satisfy our income tax obligations.Our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited.Net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) approximating $643 were available at December 31, 2017 to reduce future U.S. income tax liabilities. Our ability to utilize these NOLs may be limited as a result of certain change of control provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Code). Of this amount, NOLs of approximately $458 are treated as losses incurred before the change of control upon emergence from Chapter 11 and are limited to annual utilization of $84. The balance of our NOLs, treated as incurred subsequent to the change in control, is not subject to limitation as of December 31, 2017. However, there can be no assurance that trading in our shares will not effect another change in control under the Code, which would further limit our ability to utilize our available NOLs. Such limitations may cause us to pay income taxes earlier and in greater amounts than would be the case if the NOLs were not subject to limitation.An inability to provide products with the technology required to satisfy customer requirements would adversely impact our ability to successfully compete in our markets.The vehicular markets in which we operate are undergoing significant technological change, with increasing focus on electrified and autonomous vehicles. These and other technological advances could render certain of our products obsolete. Maintaining our competitive position is dependent on our ability to develop commercially-viable products and services that support the future technologies embraced by our customers.Failure to appropriately anticipate and react to the cyclical and volatile nature of production rates and customer demands in our business can adversely impact our results of operations.Our financial performance is directly related to production levels of our customers. In several of our markets, customer production levels are prone to significant cyclicality, influenced by general economic conditions, changing consumer preferences, regulatory changes, and other factors. Oftentimes the rapidity of the downcycles and upcycles can be severe. Successfully executing operationally during periods of extreme downward and upward demand pressures can be challenging. Our inability to recognize and react appropriately to the production cycles inherent in our markets can adversely impact our operating results.Our continued success is dependent on being able to attract and retain requisite talent.Sustaining and growing our business requires that we continue to attract, develop and retain people with the requisite skills. With the vehicles of the future expected to undergo significant technological change, having qualified people savvy in the right technologies will be a key factor in our ability to develop the products necessary to successfully compete in the future. 10As a global organization, we are also dependent on our ability to attract and maintain a diverse work force that is fully engaged supporting our company’s objectives and initiatives.Failure to maintain effective internal controls could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.Regulatory provisions governing the financial reporting of U.S. public companies require that we maintain effective disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting across our operations in 33 countries. Effective internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance of compliance, and, as such, they can be susceptible to human error, circumvention or override, and fraud. Failure to maintain adequate, effective internal controls could result in potential financial misstatements or other forms of noncompliance that have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or organizational reputation. Our 2017 acquisitions were exempt from certain regulatory internal control compliance requirements this past year, but are required to be compliant in 2018.Developments in the financial markets or downgrades to Dana's credit rating could restrict our access to capital and increase financing costs.At December 31, 2017, Dana had consolidated debt obligations of $1,821, with cash and marketable securities of $643 and unused revolving credit capacity of $578. Our ability to grow the business and satisfy debt service obligations is dependent, in part, on our ability to gain access to capital at competitive costs. External factors beyond our control can adversely affect capital markets – either tightening availability of capital or increasing the cost of available capital. Failure on our part to maintain adequate financial performance and appropriate credit metrics can also affect our ability to access capital at competitive prices. Risk Factors
 Related to our SecuritiesProvisions in our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may discourage a takeover attempt.Certain provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, as well as the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Dana. Such provisions, including those governing the nomination of directors, limiting who may call special stockholders’ meetings and eliminating stockholder action by written consent, may make it more difficult for other persons, without the approval of our board of directors, to make a tender offer or otherwise acquire substantial amounts of common stock or to launch other takeover attempts that a stockholder might consider to be in such stockholder’s best interest"
16,DAN,DANA INC,2017-02-10,"Risk Factors
We are impacted by events and conditions that affect the light vehicle, medium/heavy vehicle and off-highway markets that we serve, as well as by factors specific to Dana. Among the risks that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations are the following, many of which are interrelated.5Risk Factors
 Related to the Markets We ServeFailure to sustain a continuing economic recovery in the United States and elsewhere could have a substantial adverse effect on our business.Our business is tied to general economic and industry conditions as demand for vehicles depends largely on the strength of the economy, employment levels, consumer confidence levels, the availability and cost of credit and the cost of fuel. These factors have had and could continue to have a substantial impact on our business.We expect global market conditions to result in overall comparable sales in 2017. We expect the North America economic climate will continue to be modestly strong to stable with light vehicle demand levels continuing to be strong, while the medium/heavy truck market is expected to be weaker and the off-highway market remains relatively stable at already weak levels. The economy in Europe is expected to improve modestly, with on-highway markets being slightly stronger while the off-highway market remains weak but stable. The South America countries where we do business are expected to remain relatively weak, but show signs of improvement as we progress through 2017. We expect the rate of growth to be more modest in the Asia Pacific region in 2017, with the markets we serve in the region being relatively stable or facing some headwinds. Adverse developments in the economic conditions of any of these markets could reduce demand for new vehicles, causing our customers to reduce their vehicle production and, as a result, demand for our products would be adversely affected. Certain political developments occurring this past year have provided increased economic uncertainty. The United Kingdom's decision to exit the European Union and the results of the presidential election in the U.S. both could result in economic and trade policy actions that would impact economic conditions in various countries, the cost of importing into the U.S. and the competitive landscape of our customers, suppliers and competitors. Adverse global economic conditions could also cause our customers and suppliers to experience severe economic constraints in the future, including bankruptcy, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.We could be adversely impacted by the loss of any of our significant customers, changes in their requirements for our products or changes in their financial condition.We are reliant upon sales to several significant customers. Sales to our ten largest customers accounted for 62% of our overall sales in 2016. Changes in our business relationships with any of our large customers or in the timing, size and continuation of their various programs could have a material adverse impact on us.The loss of any of these customers, the loss of business with respect to one or more of their vehicle models on which we have high component content, or a significant decline in the production levels of such vehicles would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Pricing pressure from our customers also poses certain risks. Inability on our part to offset pricing concessions with cost reductions would adversely affect our profitability. We are continually bidding on new business with these customers, as well as seeking to diversify our customer base, but there is no assurance that our efforts will be successful. Further, to the extent that the financial condition of our largest customers deteriorates, including possible bankruptcies, mergers or liquidations, or their sales otherwise decline, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.We may be adversely impacted by changes in international legislative and political conditions.We operate in 25 countries around the world and we depend on significant foreign suppliers and customers. Further, we have several growth initiatives that are targeting emerging markets like China and India. Legislative and political activities within the countries where we conduct business, particularly in emerging markets and less developed countries, could adversely impact our ability to operate in those countries. The political situation in a number of countries in which we operate could create instability in our contractual relationships with no effective legal safeguards for resolution of these issues, or potentially result in the seizure of our assets. Through January 23, 2015, we operated in Venezuela where government exchange controls and policies placed restrictions on our ability to operate effectively and repatriate funds.  Our risk associated with operating in this country was eliminated with the divestiture of our operations in Venezuela on January 23, 2015. However, we expect to continue exporting product to Venezuela, and our ability to do so effectively could be adversely impacted by Venezuela government policies.  We operate in Argentina, where trade-related initiatives and other government restrictions limit our 6ability to optimize operating effectiveness.  At December 31, 2016, our net asset exposure related to Argentina was approximately $15, including $10 of net fixed assets.We may be adversely impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies in the other countries in which we do business.Approximately 54% of our sales in 2016 were from operations located in countries other than the U.S. Currency variations can have an impact on our results (expressed in U.S. dollars). Currency variations can also adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the U.S. and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from affiliates or other suppliers located outside of the U.S. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and currencies of other countries in which we have operations has had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results reported in U.S. dollars. We use a combination of natural hedging techniques and financial derivatives to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risks. Such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations.We may be adversely impacted by new laws, regulations or policies of governmental organizations related to increased fuel economy standards and reduced greenhouse gas emissions, or changes in existing ones.The markets and customers we serve are subject to substantial government regulation, which often differs by state, region and country. These regulations, and proposals for additional regulation, are advanced primarily out of concern for the environment (including concerns about global climate change and its impact) and energy independence. We anticipate that the number and extent of these regulations, and the costs to comply with them, will increase significantly in the future.In the U.S., vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions are regulated under a harmonized national program administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Other governments in the markets we serve are also creating new policies to address these same issues, including the European Union, Brazil, China and India. These government regulatory requirements could significantly affect our customers by altering their global product development plans and substantially increasing their costs, which could result in limitations on the types of vehicles they sell and the geographical markets they serve. Any of these outcomes could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.Company-Specific Risk Factors
We have taken, and continue to take, cost-reduction actions. Although our process includes planning for potential negative consequences, the cost-reduction actions may expose us to additional production risk and could adversely affect our sales, profitability and ability to attract and retain employees.We have been reducing costs in all of our businesses and have discontinued product lines, exited businesses, consolidated manufacturing operations and positioned operations in lower cost locations. The impact of these cost-reduction actions on our sales and profitability may be influenced by many factors including our ability to successfully complete these ongoing efforts, our ability to generate the level of cost savings we expect or that are necessary to enable us to effectively compete, delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, decline in employee morale and the potential inability to meet operational targets due to our inability to retain or recruit key employees.We depend on our subsidiaries for cash to satisfy the obligations of the company.Our subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and own substantially all of our assets. Our cash flow and our ability to meet our obligations depend on the cash flow of our subsidiaries. In addition, the payment of funds in the form of dividends, intercompany payments, tax sharing payments and otherwise may be subject to restrictions under the laws of the countries of incorporation of our subsidiaries or the by-laws of the subsidiary.Labor stoppages or work slowdowns at Dana, key suppliers or our customers could result in a disruption in our operations and have a material adverse effect on our businesses.We and our customers rely on our respective suppliers to provide parts needed to maintain production levels. We all rely on workforces represented by labor unions. Workforce disputes that result in work stoppages or slowdowns could disrupt operations of all of these businesses, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the supply of, or demand for, the products we supply our customers.7We could be adversely affected if we are unable to recover portions of commodity costs (including costs of steel, other raw materials and energy) from our customers.We continue to work with our customers to recover a portion of our material cost increases. While we have been successful in the past recovering a significant portion of such cost increases, there is no assurance that increases in commodity costs will not adversely impact our profitability in the future.We could be adversely affected if we experience shortages of components from our suppliers or if disruptions in the supply chain lead to parts shortages for our customers.A substantial portion of our annual cost of sales is driven by the purchase of goods and services. To manage and minimize these costs, we have been consolidating our supplier base. As a result, we are dependent on single sources of supply for some components of our products. We select our suppliers based on total value (including price, delivery and quality), taking into consideration their production capacities and financial condition, and we expect that they will be able to support our needs. However, there is no assurance that adverse financial conditions, including bankruptcies of our suppliers, reduced levels of production, natural disasters or other problems experienced by our suppliers will not result in shortages or delays in their supply of components to us or even in the financial collapse of one or more such suppliers. If we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers, particularly those who are sole sources, and were unable to procure the components from other sources, we would be unable to meet our production schedules for some of our key products and to ship such products to our customers in a timely fashion, which would adversely affect our sales, profitability and customer relations.Adverse economic conditions, natural disasters and other factors can similarly lead to financial distress or production problems for other suppliers to our customers which can create disruptions to our production levels. Any such supply-chain induced disruptions to our production are likely to create operating inefficiencies that will adversely affect our sales, profitability and customer relations.We ended the contractual relationship with one of our largest suppliers at the end of 2014 and established relationships with alternative suppliers. During the first half of 2015, as we transitioned to the new suppliers, we were challenged with relatively high levels of demand in the market segment supported by these suppliers. This resulted in increased costs in the first half of 2015. Additionally, our inability to fully satisfy customer demands led to some lost business with a significant customer. There is a risk that our operating results and customer relationships could be adversely impacted if other supplier transitions are not completed effectively. In 2014, the financial condition of a major supplier to our South America operations led to them pursuing legal reorganization. As more fully described in Notes 2 and 3 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, legal actions were required in 2015 to maintain the supply of product from this supplier and, in 2016, we ultimately acquired strategic assets from this supplier necessary to satisfy our customer commitments.In 2016, the financial condition of a single source supplier to our North American operations led them to requestsignificant price increases which we have not accepted. Although this supplier is providing us with the required supply, there iscontinued uncertainty whether we will be able to maintain cost-effective, uninterrupted supply.Our profitability and results of operations may be adversely affected by program launch difficulties.The launch of new business is a complex process, the success of which depends on a wide range of factors, including the production readiness of our manufacturing facilities and manufacturing processes and those of our suppliers, as well as factors related to tooling, equipment, employees, initial product quality and other factors. Our failure to successfully launch material new or takeover business could have an adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.We use important intellectual property in our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected.We own important intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements. Our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve. Our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license. Further, as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the 8protection of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases, despite efforts we undertake to protect them. Developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights, and any inability to protect these rights, could have a material adverse impact on our business and our competitive position.We could encounter unexpected difficulties integrating acquisitions and joint ventures.We acquired businesses in 2016, and we expect to complete additional acquisitions and investments in the future that complement or expand our businesses. The success of this strategy will depend on our ability to successfully complete these transactions or arrangements, to integrate the businesses acquired in these transactions and to develop satisfactory working arrangements with our strategic partners in the joint ventures. We could encounter unexpected difficulties in completing these transactions and integrating the acquisitions with our existing operations. We also may not realize the degree or timing of benefits anticipated when we entered into a transaction.Several of our joint ventures operate pursuant to established agreements and, as such, we do not unilaterally control the joint venture. There is a risk that the partners’ objectives for the joint venture may not be aligned with ours, leading to potential differences over management of the joint venture that could adversely impact its financial performance and consequent contribution to our earnings. Additionally, inability on the part of our partners to satisfy their contractual obligations under the agreements could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.We could be adversely impacted by the costs of environmental, health, safety and product liability compliance.Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries that govern emissions to the air; discharges to water; the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials; and the cleanup of contaminated properties. Historically, other than an EPA settlement as part of our bankruptcy proceedings, environmental costs related to our former and existing operations have not been material. However, there is no assurance that the costs of complying with current environmental laws and regulations, or those that may be adopted in the future, will not increase and adversely impact us.There is also no assurance that the costs of complying with current laws and regulations, or those that may be adopted in the future, that relate to health, safety and product liability matters will not adversely impact us. There is also a risk of warranty and product liability claims, as well as product recalls, if our products fail to perform to specifications or cause property damage, injury or death. (See Notes 15 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on product liabilities and warranties.)A failure of our information technology infrastructure could adversely impact our business and operations.We recognize the increasing volume of cyber attacks and employ commercially practical efforts to provide reasonable assurance that the risks of such attacks are appropriately mitigated. Each year, we evaluate the threat profile of our industry to stay abreast of trends and to provide reasonable assurance our existing countermeasures will address any new threats identified. Despite our implementation of security measures, our IT systems and those of our service providers are vulnerable to circumstances beyond our reasonable control including acts of terror, acts of government, natural disasters, civil unrest and denial of service attacks which may lead to the theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or business disruption. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers, suppliers and employees, lead to claims against the company and ultimately harm our business. Additionally, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.We participate in certain multi-employer pension plans which are not fully funded.We contribute to certain multi-employer defined benefit pension plans for our union-represented employees in the U.S. in accordance with our collective bargaining agreements. Contributions are based on hours worked except in cases of layoff or leave where we generally contribute based on 40 hours per week for a maximum of one year. The plans are not fully funded as of December 31, 2016. We could be held liable to the plans for our obligation, as well as those of other employers, due to our participation in the plans. Contribution rates could increase if the plans are required to adopt a funding improvement plan, if the performance of plan assets does not meet expectations or as a result of future collectively bargained wage and benefit agreements. (See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on multi-employer pension plans.)9Changes in interest rates and asset returns could increase our pension funding obligations and reduce our profitability.We have unfunded obligations under certain of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The valuation of our future payment obligations under the plans and the related plan assets are subject to significant adverse changes if the credit and capital markets cause interest rates and projected rates of return to decline.  Such declines could also require us to make significant additional contributions to our pension plans in the future.  A material increase in the unfunded obligations of these plans could also result in a significant increase in our pension expense in the future.We may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.Our provision for income taxes and the cash outlays required to satisfy our income tax obligations in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors. These factors include changes in the level of earnings in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets, changes in our plans to repatriate the earnings of our non-U.S. operations to the U.S. and changes in tax laws and regulations. The 2016 presidential election in the U.S. has resulted in an administration and Congress that are controlled by the same party. Changes to tax policy and tax rates are considered likely and, depending on the nature of these changes, could have a significant impact on our business and financial results. Our income tax returns are subject to examination by federal, state and local tax authorities in the U.S. and tax authorities outside the U.S. The results of these examinations and the ongoing assessments of our tax exposures could also have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and the cash outlays required to satisfy our income tax obligations.Our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited.Net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) approximating $796 were available at December 31, 2016 to reduce future U.S. income tax liabilities. Our ability to utilize these NOLs may be limited as a result of certain change of control provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Code). Of this amount, NOLs of approximately $577 are treated as losses incurred before the change of control upon emergence from Chapter 11 and are limited to annual utilization of $84. The balance of our NOLs, treated as incurred subsequent to the change in control, is not subject to limitation as of December 31, 2016. However, there can be no assurance that trading in our shares will not effect another change in control under the Code, which would further limit our ability to utilize our available NOLs. Such limitations may cause us to pay income taxes earlier and in greater amounts than would be the case if the NOLs were not subject to limitation.Risk Factors
 Related to our SecuritiesProvisions in our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may discourage a takeover attempt.Certain provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, as well as the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Dana. Such provisions, including those governing the nomination of directors, limiting who may call special stockholders’ meetings and eliminating stockholder action by written consent, may make it more difficult for other persons, without the approval of our board of directors, to make a tender offer or otherwise acquire substantial amounts of common stock or to launch other takeover attempts that a stockholder might consider to be in such stockholder’s best interest"
5,DAN,DANA INC,2016-02-18,"Risk Factors
 We are impacted by events and conditions that affect the light vehicle, medium/heavy vehicle and off-highway markets that we serve, as well as by factors specific to Dana. Among the risks that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations are the following, many of which are interrelated. Risk Factors
 Related to the Markets We Serve Failure to sustain a continuing economic recovery in the United States and elsewhere could have a substantial adverse effect on our business. 5Our business is tied to general economic and industry conditions as demand for vehicles depends largely on the strength of the economy, employment levels, consumer confidence levels, the availability and cost of credit and the cost of fuel. These factors have had and could continue to have a substantial impact on our business.We expect global market conditions to result in overall comparable sales in 2016. We expect the North America economic climate will continue to be modestly strong to stable with light vehicle demand levels continuing to be strong, while the medium/heavy truck market is expected to be weaker and the off-highway market remains relatively stable at already weak levels. Although the rate of growth in the Asia Pacific region has slowed, we expect overall economic improvement in the on-highway markets in 2016, with off-highway segment demand continuing to be weak. The economy in Europe is expected to improve modestly, with on-highway markets being slightly stronger while the off-highway market remains weak but stable. The South America countries where we do business are expected to remain relatively weak across all our markets in 2016. Adverse developments in the economic conditions of these markets could reduce demand for new vehicles, causing our customers to reduce their vehicle production and, as a result, demand for our products would be adversely affected. Adverse global economic conditions could also cause our customers and suppliers to experience severe economic constraints in the future, including bankruptcy, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. We could be adversely impacted by the loss of any of our significant customers, changes in their requirements for our products or changes in their financial condition. We are reliant upon sales to several significant customers. Sales to our ten largest customers accounted for 58% of our overall sales in 2015. Changes in our business relationships with any of our large customers or in the timing, size and continuation of their various programs could have a material adverse impact on us. The loss of any of these customers, the loss of business with respect to one or more of their vehicle models on which we have high component content, or a significant decline in the production levels of such vehicles would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Pricing pressure from our customers also poses certain risks. Inability on our part to offset pricing concessions with cost reductions would adversely affect our profitability. We are continually bidding on new business with these customers, as well as seeking to diversify our customer base, but there is no assurance that our efforts will be successful. Further, to the extent that the financial condition of our largest customers deteriorates, including possible bankruptcies, mergers or liquidations, or their sales otherwise decline, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected. We may be adversely impacted by changes in international legislative and political conditions.We operate in 25 countries around the world and we depend on significant foreign suppliers and customers. Further, we have several growth initiatives that are targeting emerging markets like China and India. Legislative and political activities within the countries where we conduct business, particularly in emerging markets and less developed countries, could adversely impact our ability to operate in those countries. The political situation in a number of countries in which we operate could create instability in our contractual relationships with no effective legal safeguards for resolution of these issues, or potentially result in the seizure of our assets. Through January 23, 2015, we operated in Venezuela where government exchange controls and policies placed restrictions on our ability to operate effectively and repatriate funds.  Our risk associated with operating in this country was eliminated with the divestiture of our operations in Venezuela on January 23, 2015. However, we expect to continue exporting product to Venezuela, and our ability to do so effectively could be adversely impacted by Venezuela government policies.  We operate in Argentina, where trade-related initiatives and other government restrictions limit our ability to optimize operating effectiveness.  At December 31, 2015, our net asset exposure related to Argentina was approximately $21, including $11 of net fixed assets.We may be adversely impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies in the other countries in which we do business.Approximately 54% of our sales in 2015 were from operations located in countries other than the U.S. Currency variations can have an impact on our results (expressed in U.S. dollars). Currency variations can also adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the U.S. and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from affiliates or other suppliers located outside of the U.S. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and currencies of other countries in which we have operations has had and could continue to have an adverse affect our results reported in U.S. dollars. We use a combination of natural hedging techniques and financial derivatives to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risks. Such 6hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations.We may be adversely impacted by new laws, regulations or policies of governmental organizations related to increased fuel economy standards and reduced greenhouse gas emissions, or changes in existing ones. The markets and customers we serve are subject to substantial government regulation, which often differs by state, region and country. These regulations, and proposals for additional regulation, are advanced primarily out of concern for the environment (including concerns about global climate change and its impact) and energy independence. We anticipate that the number and extent of these regulations, and the costs to comply with them, will increase significantly in the future. In the U.S., vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions are regulated under a harmonized national program administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency. Other governments in the markets we serve are also creating new policies to address these same issues, including the European Union, Brazil, China and India. These government regulatory requirements could significantly affect our customers by altering their global product development plans and substantially increasing their costs, which could result in limitations on the types of vehicles they sell and the geographical markets they serve. Any of these outcomes could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.Company-Specific Risk Factors
 We have taken, and continue to take, cost-reduction actions. Although our process includes planning for potential negative consequences, the cost-reduction actions may expose us to additional production risk and could adversely affect our sales, profitability and ability to attract and retain employees. We have been reducing costs in all of our businesses and have discontinued product lines, exited businesses, consolidated manufacturing operations and positioned operations in lower cost locations. The impact of these cost-reduction actions on our sales and profitability may be influenced by many factors including our ability to successfully complete these ongoing efforts, our ability to generate the level of cost savings we expect or that are necessary to enable us to effectively compete, delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, decline in employee morale and the potential inability to meet operational targets due to our inability to retain or recruit key employees. We operate as a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for cash to satisfy the obligations of the holding company. Dana Holding Corporation is a holding company. Our subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and own substantially all of our assets. Our cash flow and our ability to meet our obligations depend on the cash flow of our subsidiaries. In addition, the payment of funds in the form of dividends, intercompany payments, tax sharing payments and otherwise may be subject to restrictions under the laws of the countries of incorporation of our subsidiaries or the by-laws of the subsidiary. Labor stoppages or work slowdowns at Dana, key suppliers or our customers could result in a disruption in our operations and have a material adverse effect on our businesses. We and our customers rely on our respective suppliers to provide parts needed to maintain production levels. We all rely on workforces represented by labor unions. Workforce disputes that result in work stoppages or slowdowns could disrupt operations of all of these businesses, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the supply of, or demand for, the products we supply our customers. We could be adversely affected if we are unable to recover portions of commodity costs (including costs of steel, other raw materials and energy) from our customers. We continue to work with our customers to recover a portion of our material cost increases. While we have been successful in the past recovering a significant portion of such cost increases, there is no assurance that increases in commodity costs will not adversely impact our profitability in the future. We could be adversely affected if we experience shortages of components from our suppliers or if disruptions in the supply chain lead to parts shortages for our customers. A substantial portion of our annual cost of sales is driven by the purchase of goods and services. To manage and minimize these costs, we have been consolidating our supplier base. As a result, we are dependent on single sources of supply for some 7components of our products. We select our suppliers based on total value (including price, delivery and quality), taking into consideration their production capacities and financial condition, and we expect that they will be able to support our needs. However, there is no assurance that adverse financial conditions, including bankruptcies of our suppliers, reduced levels of production, natural disasters or other problems experienced by our suppliers will not result in shortages or delays in their supply of components to us or even in the financial collapse of one or more such suppliers. If we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers, particularly those who are sole sources, and were unable to procure the components from other sources, we would be unable to meet our production schedules for some of our key products and to ship such products to our customers in a timely fashion, which would adversely affect our sales, profitability and customer relations.Adverse economic conditions, natural disasters and other factors can similarly lead to financial distress or production problems for other suppliers to our customers which can create disruptions to our production levels. Any such supply-chain induced disruptions to our production are likely to create operating inefficiencies that will adversely affect our sales, profitability and customer relations.During 2013, we advised one of our largest suppliers that we did not intend to extend our existing contractual relationship beyond the contract expiration date of December 31, 2014. As a consequence, we established relationships with alternative suppliers. During the first half of 2015 as we transitioned to new suppliers, we were challenged with relatively high levels of demand in the market segment supported by these suppliers. This resulted in increased costs in the first half of 2015. Additionally, our inability to fully satisfy customer demands led to some lost business with a significant customer. There is a risk that our operating results and customer relationships could be adversely impacted if other supplier transitions are not completed effectively. In 2014, the financial condition of a major supplier to our South America operations led to them pursuing legal reorganization. As more fully described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, in 2015, legal actions were required to maintain the supply of product from this supplier that was necessary to satisfy our customer commitments. Although we are currently operating under an arrangement with this supplier that is providing us with the required supply, we have incurred additional costs and there is continued uncertainty whether we will be able to maintain cost effective, uninterrupted supply. Our future operating results and customer relationships could be adversely impacted depending on the actions required to maintain existing product supply and the outcome of this supplier's legal reorganization. Our Commercial Vehicle operating segment had sales $98 and $225 in 2015 and 2014 attributable to axles and parts sourced from this supplier.We use important intellectual property in our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected. We own important intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements. Our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve. Our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license. Further, as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the protection of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases, despite efforts we undertake to protect them. Developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights, and any inability to protect these rights, could materially adversely impact our business and our competitive position. We could encounter unexpected difficulties integrating acquisitions and joint ventures. We acquired businesses and invested in joint ventures in 2012 and 2011, and we expect to complete additional investments in the future that complement or expand our businesses. The success of this strategy will depend on our ability to successfully complete these transactions or arrangements, to integrate the businesses acquired in these transactions and to develop satisfactory working arrangements with our strategic partners in the joint ventures. We could encounter unexpected difficulties in completing these transactions and integrating the acquisitions with our existing operations. We also may not realize the degree or timing of benefits anticipated when we entered into a transaction. Several of our joint ventures operate pursuant to established agreements and, as such, we do not unilaterally control the joint venture. There is a risk that the partners’ objectives for the joint venture may not be aligned, leading to potential differences over management of the joint venture that could adversely impact its financial performance and consequent contribution to our earnings. Additionally, inability on the part of our partners to satisfy their contractual obligations under the agreements could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. 8We could be adversely impacted by the costs of environmental, health, safety and product liability compliance.Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries that govern emissions to the air; discharges to water; the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials; and the cleanup of contaminated properties. Historically, other than an U.S. Environmental Protection Agency settlement as part of our bankruptcy proceedings, environmental costs related to our former and existing operations have not been material. However, there is no assurance that the costs of complying with current environmental laws and regulations, or those that may be adopted in the future, will not increase and adversely impact us.There is also no assurance that the costs of complying with current laws and regulations, or those that may be adopted in the future, that relate to health, safety and product liability matters will not adversely impact us. There is also a risk of warranty and product liability claims, as well as product recalls, if our products fail to perform to specifications or cause property damage, injury or death, and a risk that asbestos-related product liability claims could result in increased liabilities at Dana Companies, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary. (See Notes 14 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on product liabilities and warranties.) A failure of our information technology infrastructure could adversely impact our business and operations. We recognize the increasing volume of cyber attacks and employ commercially practical efforts to provide reasonable assurance that the risks of such attacks are appropriately mitigated. Each year, we evaluate the threat profile of our industry to stay abreast of trends and to provide reasonable assurance our existing countermeasures will address any new threats identified. Despite our implementation of security measures, our IT systems and those of our service providers are vulnerable to circumstances beyond our reasonable control including acts of terror, acts of government, natural disasters, civil unrest and denial of service attacks which may lead to the theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or business disruption. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers, suppliers and employees, lead to claims against the company and ultimately harm our business. Additionally, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future. We participate in certain multi-employer pension plans which are not fully funded. We contribute to certain multi-employer defined benefit pension plans for our union-represented employees in the U.S. in accordance with our collective bargaining agreements. Contributions are based on hours worked except in cases of layoff or leave where we generally contribute based on 40 hours per week for a maximum of one year. The plans are not fully funded as of December 31, 2015. We could be held liable to the plans for our obligation, as well as those of other employers, due to our participation in the plans. Contribution rates could increase if the plans are required to adopt a funding improvement plan, if the performance of plan assets does not meet expectations or as a result of future collectively bargained wage and benefit agreements. (See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on multi-employer pension plans.)Changes in interest rates and asset returns could increase our pension funding obligations and reduce our profitability.We have unfunded obligations under certain of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The valuation of our future payment obligations under the plans and the related plan assets are subject to significant adverse changes if the credit and capital markets cause interest rates and projected rates of return to decline.  Such declines could also require us to make significant additional contributions to our pension plans in the future.  A material increase in the unfunded obligations of these plans could also result in a significant increase in our pension expense in the future.We may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.Our provision for income taxes and the cash outlays required to satisfy our income tax obligations in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors. These factors include changes in the level of earnings in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets, changes in our plans to repatriate the earnings of our non-U.S. operations to the U.S. and changes in tax laws and regulations. Our income tax returns are subject to examination by federal, state and local tax authorities in the U.S. and tax authorities outside the U.S. The results of these examinations and the ongoing assessments of our tax exposures could also have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and the cash outlays required to satisfy our income tax obligations.9Our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited.Net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) approximating $729 were available at December 31, 2015 to reduce future U.S. income tax liabilities. Our ability to utilize these NOLs may be limited as a result of certain change of control provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Code). Of this amount, NOLs of approximately $594 are treated as losses incurred before the change of control upon emergence from Chapter 11 and are limited to annual utilization of $84. The balance of our NOLs, treated as incurred subsequent to the change in control, is not subject to limitation as of December 31, 2015. However, there can be no assurance that trading in our shares will not effect another change in control under the Code, which would further limit our ability to utilize our available NOLs. Such limitations may cause us to pay income taxes earlier and in greater amounts than would be the case if the NOLs were not subject to limitation.Risk Factors
 Related to our Securities Provisions in our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may discourage a takeover attempt. Certain provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, as well as the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Dana. Such provisions, including those governing the nomination of directors, limiting who may call special stockholders’ meetings and eliminating stockholder action by written consent, may make it more difficult for other persons, without the approval of our board of directors, to make a tender offer or otherwise acquire substantial amounts of common stock or to launch other takeover attempts that a stockholder might consider to be in such stockholder’s best interest. "

 We are impacted by events and conditions that affect the light vehicle, medium/heavy vehicle and off-highway markets that we serve, as well as by factors specific to Dana. Among the risks that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations are the following, many of which are interrelated. Risk Factors
 Related to the Markets We Serve Failure to sustain a continuing economic recovery in the United States and elsewhere could have a substantial adverse effect on our business. Our business is tied to general economic and industry conditions as demand for vehicles depends largely on the strength of the economy, employment levels, consumer confidence levels, the availability and cost of credit and the cost of fuel. These factors have had and could continue to have a substantial impact on our business.5We expect an overall modest sales increase in 2015 from global market conditions. We expect the North America economic climate will continue to be strong, contributing to stable or modest improvements in the markets we serve.  Although the rate of growth in the Asia Pacific region has slowed, we expect overall economic improvement in that region in 2015. The economy in Europe is expected to improve modestly, while the South America countries where we do business are expected to remain relatively weak in 2015. Adverse developments in the economic conditions of these markets could reduce demand for new vehicles, causing our customers to reduce their vehicle production and, as a result, demand for our products would be adversely affected. Adverse global economic conditions could also cause our customers and suppliers to experience severe economic constraints in the future, including bankruptcy, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. We could be adversely impacted by the loss of any of our significant customers, changes in their requirements for our products or changes in their financial condition. We are reliant upon sales to several significant customers. Sales to our ten largest customers accounted for 55% of our overall sales in 2014. Changes in our business relationships with any of our large customers or in the timing, size and continuation of their various programs could have a material adverse impact on us. The loss of any of these customers, the loss of business with respect to one or more of their vehicle models on which we have high component content, or a significant decline in the production levels of such vehicles would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Pricing pressure from our customers also poses certain risks. Inability on our part to offset pricing concessions with cost reductions would adversely affect our profitability. We are continually bidding on new business with these customers, as well as seeking to diversify our customer base, but there is no assurance that our efforts will be successful. Further, to the extent that the financial condition of our largest customers deteriorates, including possible bankruptcies, mergers or liquidations, or their sales otherwise decline, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected. We may be adversely impacted by changes in international legislative and political conditions.We operate in 25 countries around the world and we depend on significant foreign suppliers and customers. Further, we have several growth initiatives that are targeting emerging markets like China and India. Legislative and political activities within the countries where we conduct business, particularly in emerging markets and less developed countries, could adversely impact our ability to operate in those countries. The political situation in a number of countries in which we operate could create instability in our contractual relationships with no effective legal safeguards for resolution of these issues, or potentially result in the seizure of our assets. Through January 23, 2015, we operated in Venezuela where government exchange controls and policies placed restrictions on our ability to operate effectively and repatriate funds.  Our risk associated with operating in this country was significantly reduced with the divestiture of our operations in Venezuela on January 23, 2015. However, we expect to continue exporting product to Venezuela, and our ability to do so effectively could be adversely impacted by Venezuela government policies.  We operate in Argentina, where trade-related initiatives and other government restrictions limit our ability to optimize operating effectiveness.  At December 31, 2014, our net asset exposure related to Argentina was approximately $30, including $12 of net fixed assets.We may be adversely impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies in the other countries in which we do business.Approximately 58% of our sales in 2014 were from operations located in countries other than the U.S. Currency variations can have an impact on our results (expressed in U.S. dollars). Currency variations can also adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the U.S. and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from affiliates or other suppliers located outside of the U.S. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and currencies of other countries in which we have operations could adversely affect our results reported in U.S. dollars. We use a combination of natural hedging techniques and financial derivatives to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risks. Such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations.6We may be adversely impacted by new laws, regulations or policies of governmental organizations related to increased fuel economy standards and reduced greenhouse gas emissions, or changes in existing ones. The markets and customers we serve are subject to a substantial amount of government regulation, which often differs by state, region and country. Government regulations, and proposals for additional regulation, are advanced primarily out of concern for the environment (including concerns about the possibility of global climate change and its impact) and energy independence. We anticipate that the number and extent of these regulations, and the costs to comply with them, will increase significantly in the future. In the U.S., vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions are regulated under a harmonized national program administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency. Other governments in the markets we serve are also creating new policies to address these same issues, including the European Union, Brazil, China and India. These government regulatory requirements could significantly affect our customers by altering their global product development plans and substantially increasing their costs, which could result in limitations on the types of vehicles they sell and the geographical markets they serve. Any of these outcomes could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.Company-Specific Risk Factors

 Related to the Markets We Serve Failure to sustain a continuing economic recovery in the United States and elsewhere could have a substantial adverse effect on our business. Our business is tied to general economic and industry conditions as demand for vehicles depends largely on the strength of the economy, employment levels, consumer confidence levels, the availability and cost of credit and the cost of fuel. These factors have had and could continue to have a substantial impact on our business.5 While we expect a continuing overall economic recovery in 2014, negative economic conditions such as a worsening debt crisis in Europe or rising fuel prices could adversely impact our business.

The political situation in a number of countries in which we operate could create instability in our contractual relationships with no effective legal safeguards for resolution of these issues, or potentially result in the seizure of our assets. We operate in Venezuela where government exchange controls place restrictions on our ability to repatriate funds, and in Argentina, where trade-related initiatives and other government restrictions limit our ability to optimize operating effectiveness.  At December 31, 2013, our net asset exposure related to Venezuela and Argentina was approximately $65 and $38 respectively, including $31 and $13 of net fixed assets. We may be adversely impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies in the other countries in which we do business. Approximately 62% of our sales in 2013 were from operations located in countries other than the U.S. Currency variations can have an impact on our results (expressed in U.S. dollars). Currency variations can also adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the U.S. and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from affiliates or other suppliers located outside of the U.S. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and currencies of other countries in which we have operations could adversely affect our results reported in U.S. dollars. We use a combination of natural hedging techniques and financial derivatives to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risks. Such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations. We may be adversely impacted by new laws, regulations or policies of governmental organizations related to increased fuel economy standards and reduced greenhouse gas emissions, or changes in existing ones. The markets and customers we serve are subject to a substantial amount of government regulation, which often differs by state, region and country. Government regulation has arisen, and proposals for additional regulation are advanced, primarily out of concern for the environment (including concerns about the possibility of global climate change and its impact) and energy independence. We anticipate that the number and extent of these regulations, and the costs to comply with them, will increase significantly in the future. 6In the U.S., vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions are regulated under a harmonized national program administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency. Other governments in the markets we serve are also creating new policies to address these same issues, including the European Union, Brazil, China and India. These government regulatory requirements could significantly affect our customers by altering their global product development plans and substantially increasing their costs, which could result in limitations on the types of vehicles they sell and the geographical markets they serve. Any of these outcomes could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.Company-Specific Risk Factors
 We have taken, and continue to take, cost-reduction actions. Although our process includes planning for potential negative consequences, the cost-reduction actions may expose us to additional production risk and could adversely affect our sales, profitability and ability to attract and retain employees. We have been reducing costs in all of our businesses and have discontinued product lines, exited businesses, consolidated manufacturing operations and positioned operations in lower cost locations. The impact of these cost-reduction actions on our sales and profitability may be influenced by many factors including our ability to successfully complete these ongoing efforts, our ability to generate the level of cost savings we expect or that are necessary to enable us to effectively compete, delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, decline in employee morale and the potential inability to meet operational targets due to our inability to retain or recruit key employees. We operate as a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for cash to satisfy the obligations of the holding company. Dana Holding Corporation is a holding company. Our subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and own substantially all of our assets. Our cash flow and our ability to meet our obligations depend on the cash flow of our subsidiaries. In addition, the payment of funds in the form of dividends, intercompany payments, tax sharing payments and otherwise may be subject to restrictions under the laws of the countries of incorporation of our subsidiaries or the by-laws of the subsidiary. Labor stoppages or work slowdowns at Dana, key suppliers or our customers could result in a disruption in our operations and have a material adverse effect on our businesses. We and our customers rely on our respective suppliers to provide parts needed to maintain production levels. We all rely on workforces represented by labor unions. Workforce disputes that result in work stoppages or slowdowns could disrupt operations of all of these businesses, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the supply of, or demand for, the products we supply our customers. We could be adversely affected if we are unable to recover portions of commodity costs (including costs of steel, other raw materials and energy) from our customers. We continue to work with our customers to recover a greater portion of our material cost increases. While we have been successful in the past recovering a significant portion of such cost increases, there is no assurance that increases in commodity costs will not adversely impact our profitability in the future. We could be adversely affected if we experience shortages of components from our suppliers or if disruptions in the supply chain lead to parts shortages for our customers. A substantial portion of our annual cost of sales is driven by the purchase of goods and services. To manage and reduce these costs, we have been consolidating our supplier base. As a result, we are dependent on single sources of supply for some components of our products. We select our suppliers based on total value (including price, delivery and quality), taking into consideration their production capacities and financial condition, and we expect that they will be able to support our needs. However, there is no assurance that adverse financial conditions, including bankruptcies of our suppliers, reduced levels of production, natural disasters or other problems experienced by our suppliers will not result in shortages or delays in their supply of components to us or even in the financial collapse of one or more such suppliers. If we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers, particularly those who are sole sources, and were unable to procure the components from other sources, we would be unable to meet our production schedules for some of our key products and to ship such products to our customers in a timely fashion, which would adversely affect our sales, profitability and customer relations. 7Adverse economic conditions, natural disasters and other factors can similarly lead to financial distress or production problems for other suppliers to our customers which can create disruptions to our production levels. Any such supply-chain induced disruptions to our production are likely to create operating inefficiencies that will adversely affect our sales, profitability and customer relations.  During 2013, we advised one of our largest suppliers that we do not intend to extend our existing contractual relationship beyond the current contract expiration date of December 31, 2014. As a consequence, we have established or are in the process of establishing relationships with alternative suppliers and working with our current supplier to achieve an orderly transition. There is a risk that our operating results and customer relationships could be adversely impacted if the transition to new suppliers is not effectively executed.We use important intellectual property in our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected. We own important intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements. Our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve. Our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license. Further, as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the protection of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases, despite efforts we undertake to protect them. Developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights, and any inability to protect these rights, could materially adversely impact our business and our competitive position. We could encounter unexpected difficulties integrating acquisitions and joint ventures. We acquired businesses and invested in joint ventures in 2012 and 2011, and we expect to complete additional investments in the future that complement or expand our businesses. The success of this strategy will depend on our ability to successfully complete these transactions or arrangements, to integrate the businesses acquired in these transactions and to develop satisfactory working arrangements with our strategic partners in the joint ventures. We could encounter unexpected difficulties in completing these transactions and integrating the acquisitions with our existing operations. We also may not realize the degree or timing of benefits anticipated when we entered into a transaction. Several of our joint ventures operate pursuant to established agreements and, as such, we do not unilaterally control the joint venture. There is a risk that the partners’ objectives for the joint venture may not be aligned, leading to potential differences over management of the joint venture that could adversely impact its financial performance and consequent contribution to our earnings. Additionally, inability on the part of our partner to satisfy its contractual obligations under the agreements could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. We could be adversely impacted by the costs of environmental, health, safety and product liability compliance. Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries that govern emissions to the air; discharges to water; the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials; and the cleanup of contaminated properties. Historically, other than an EPA settlement as part of our bankruptcy proceedings, environmental costs related to our former and existing operations have not been material. However, there is no assurance that the costs of complying with current environmental laws and regulations, or those that may be adopted in the future, will not increase and adversely impact us. There is also no assurance that the costs of complying with current laws and regulations, or those that may be adopted in the future, that relate to health, safety and product liability matters will not adversely impact us. There is also a risk of warranty and product liability claims, as well as product recalls, if our products fail to perform to specifications or cause property damage, injury or death, including a risk that asbestos related product liability claims could result in increased liabilities. (See Notes 15 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on warranties and product liabilities.) A failure of our information technology infrastructure could adversely impact our business and operations. We recognize the increasing volume of cyber attacks and employ commercially practical efforts to provide reasonable assurance such attacks are appropriately mitigated. Each year, we evaluate the threat profile of our industry to stay abreast of trends and to provide reasonable assurance our existing countermeasures will address any new threats identified. Despite our 8implementation of security measures, our IT systems and those of our service providers are vulnerable to circumstances beyond our reasonable control including acts of terror, acts of government, natural disasters, civil unrest, and denial of service attacks which may lead to the theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets, or business disruption. To the extent that any disruptions or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data, or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers, suppliers and employees lead to claims against the company and ultimately harm our business. Additionally, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future. We participate in certain multiemployer pension plans which are not fully funded. We contribute to certain multiemployer defined benefit pension plans for our union-represented employees in the U.S. in accordance with our collective bargaining agreements. Contributions are based on hours worked except in cases of layoff or leave where we generally contribute based on 40 hours per week for a maximum of one year. The plans are not fully funded as of December 31, 2013. We could be held liable to the plans for our obligation, as well as those of other employers, due to our participation in the plans. Contribution rates could increase if the plans are required to adopt a funding improvement plan, if the performance of plan assets does not meet expectations or as a result of future collectively bargained wage and benefit agreements. (See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on multiemployer pension plans.)Changes in interest rates and asset returns could increase our pension funding obligations and reduce our profitability.We have unfunded obligations under certain of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The valuation of our future payment obligations under the plans and the related plan assets are subject to significant adverse changes if the credit and capital markets cause interest rates and projected rates of return to decline.  Such declines could also require us to make significant additional contributions to our pension plans in the future.  A material increase in the unfunded obligations of these plans could also result in a significant increase in our pension expense in the future.We may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.Our provision for income taxes and the cash outlays required to satisfy our income tax obligations in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors.  These factors include changes in the level of earnings in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets, changes in our plans to repatriate the earnings of our non-U.S. operations to the U.S. and changes in tax laws and regulations.  Our income tax returns are subject to examination by federal, state and local tax authorities in the U.S. and tax authorities outside the U.S.  The results of these examinations and the ongoing assessments of our tax exposures could also have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and the cash outlays required to satisfy our income tax obligations.Our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited.Net operating tax loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) approximating $1,512 were available at December 31, 2013 to reduce future U.S. income tax liabilities. Our ability to utilize these NOLs may be limited as a result of certain change of control provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). Of this amount, NOLs of approximately $775 are treated as losses incurred before the change of control upon emergence from Chapter 11 and are limited to annual utilization of $84. The balance of NOLs, treated as incurred subsequent to the change in control, were not subject to limitation as of December 31, 2012. However, there can be no assurance that trading in our shares will not effect another change in control under the Code, which would further limit our ability to utilize our available NOLs. Such limitations may cause us to pay income taxes earlier and in greater amounts than would be the case if the NOLs were not subject to limitation.Risk Factors
 Related to our Securities Provisions in our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may discourage a takeover attempt. Certain provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, as well as the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Dana. Such provisions, including those governing the nomination of directors, limiting who may call special stockholders’ meetings and eliminating stockholder action by written consent may make it more difficult for other persons, without the approval of our board of directors, to make a tender offer or otherwise acquire substantial amounts of common stock or to launch other takeover attempts that a stockholder might consider to be in such stockholder’s best interest. 9"

 We are impacted by events and conditionsthat affect the light vehicle, medium/heavy vehicle and off-highway markets that we serve, as well as by factors specific to Dana.Among the risks that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations are the following,many of which are interrelated. Risk Factors
 Related to the MarketsWe Serve Failure to sustain a continuing economic recovery in theUnited States and elsewhere could have a substantial adverse effect on our business. Our business is tied to general economicand industry conditions as demand for vehicles depends largely on the strength of the economy, employment levels, consumer confidencelevels, the availability and cost of credit and the cost of fuel. These factors have had and could continue to have a substantialimpact on our business. While we expect a continuing overall economicrecovery in 2013, negative economic conditions such as a worsening debt crisis in Europe or rising fuel prices could adverselyimpact our business. Adverse developments in these conditions could reduce demand for new vehicles, causing our customers to reducetheir vehicle production and, as a result, demand for our products would be adversely affected. Our customers and suppliers could experiencesevere economic constraints in the future, including bankruptcy. Adverse global economic conditions and further deteriorationcould have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. We could be adversely impacted by the loss of any of oursignificant customers, changes in their requirements for our products or changes in their financial condition. We are reliant upon sales to several significantcustomers. Sales to our ten largest customers accounted for 54% of our overall revenue in 2012. Changes in our business relationshipswith any of our large customers or in the timing, size and continuation of their various programs could have a material adverseimpact on us. The loss of any of these customers, theloss of business with respect to one or more of their vehicle models on which we have a high component content, or a significantdecline in the production levels of such vehicles would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.Pricing pressure from our customers also poses certain risks. Inability on our part to offset pricing concessions with cost reductionswould adversely affect our profitability. We are continually bidding on new business with these customers, as well as seekingto diversify our customer base, but there is no assurance that our efforts will be successful. Further, to the extent that thefinancial condition of our largest customers deteriorates, including possible bankruptcies, mergers or liquidations, or theirsales otherwise decline, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected. We may be adversely impacted by changes in internationallegislative and political conditions. We operate in 26 countries around theworld and we depend on significant foreign suppliers and customers. Further, we have several growth initiatives that are targetingemerging markets like China and India. Legislative and political activities within the countries where we conduct business, particularlyin emerging markets and less developed countries, could adversely impact our ability to operate in those countries. The politicalsituation in a number of countries in which we operate could create instability in our contractual relationships with no effectivelegal safeguards for resolution of these issues, or potentially result in the seizure of our assets. We operate in Venezuela wheregovernment exchange controls place restrictions on our ability to repatriate funds, and in Argentina, where trade-related initiativesand other government restrictions limit our ability to optimize operating effectiveness. 6  We may be adversely impacted by the strength of the U.S.dollar relative to the currencies in the other countries in which we do business. Approximately 60% of our sales in 2012were from operations located in countries other than the U.S. Currency variations can have an impact on our results (expressedin U.S. dollars). Currency variations can also adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the U.S.and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from affiliates or other suppliers located outside of the U.S.The U.S. dollar was generally stronger during 2012 as compared to 2011. Continued strengthening against the euro and many othercurrencies of countries in which we have operations could adversely affect our results reported in U.S. dollars. We use a combinationof natural hedging techniques and financial derivatives to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risks. Such hedging activitiesmay be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations. We may be adversely impacted by new laws, regulations orpolicies of governmental organizations related to increased fuel economy standards and reduced greenhouse gas emissions, or changesin existing ones. The markets and customers we serve aresubject to a substantial amount of government regulation, which often differs by state, region and country.

 We are impacted by events and conditions that affect the light vehicle, medium/heavy vehicle and off-highway markets that we serve, as well as by factors specific to Dana. Among the risks that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations are the following, many of which are interrelated. Risk Factors
 Related to the Markets We Serve Failure to sustain a continuing economic recovery in the United States and elsewhere could have a substantial effect on our business. Our business is tied to general economic and industry conditions as demand for vehicles depends largely on the strength of the economy, employment levels, consumer confidence levels, the availability and cost of credit and the cost of fuel. These factors have had and could continue to have a substantial impact on our business. While we expect a continuing economic recovery in 2011, negative economic conditions such as rising fuel prices could adversely impact our business. Adverse developments in these conditions could reduce demand for new vehicles, causing our customers to reduce their vehicle production in North America and, as a result, demand for our products would be adversely affected. Our customers and suppliers could experience severe economic constraints in the future, including bankruptcy. Adverse global economic conditions and further deterioration could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. We could be adversely impacted by the loss of any of our significant customers, changes in their requirements for our products or changes in their financial condition. We are reliant upon sales to several significant customers. Sales to our ten largest customers accounted for 53% of our overall revenue in 2010. Changes in our business relationships with any of our large customers or in the timing, size and continuation of their various programs could have a material adverse impact on us. The loss of any of these customers, the loss of business with respect to one or more of their vehicle models on which we have a high component content, or a significant decline in the production levels of such vehicles would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Pricing pressure from our customers also poses certain risks. Inability on our part to offset pricing concessions with cost reductions would adversely affect our profitability. We are continually bidding on new business with these customers, as well as seeking to diversify our customer base, but there is no assurance that our efforts will besuccessful. Further, to the extent that the financial condition of our largest customers deteriorates, including possible bankruptcies, mergers or liquidations, or their sales otherwise decline, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected. We may be adversely impacted by changes in international legislative and political conditions. We operate in 26 countries around the world and we depend on significant foreign suppliers and customers. Further, we have several growth initiatives that are targeting emerging markets like China and India. Legislative and political activities within the countries where we conduct business, particularly in emerging markets and less developed countries, could adversely impact our ability to operate in those countries. The political situation in a number of countries in which we operate could create instability in our contractual relationships with no effective legal safeguards for resolution of these issues, or potentially result in the seizure ofour assets. We may be adversely impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies in the other countries in which we do business. Approximately 56% of our sales in 2010 were from operations located in countries other than the U.S. Currency variations can have an impact on our results (expressed in U.S. dollars). Currency variations can also adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the U.S. and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from affiliates or other suppliers located outside of the U.S. While the U.S. dollar has generally weakened over the past year, strengthening of the U.S. dollar against 7  TABLE OF CONTENTSthe euro and many other currencies of countries in which we have operations could adversely affect our results reported in U.S. dollars. We use a combination of natural hedging techniques and financial derivatives to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risks. Such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations. We may be adversely impacted by new laws, regulations or policies of governmental organizations related to increased fuel economy standards and reduced greenhouse gas emissions, or changes in existing ones. It is anticipated that the number and extent of governmental regulations related to fuel economy standards and greenhouse gas emissions, and the costs to comply with them, will increase significantly in the future. In the U.S., the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 requires significant increases in the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) requirements applicable to cars and light trucks beginning with the 2011 model year. In addition, a growing number of states are adopting regulations that establish carbon dioxide emission standards that effectively impose similarly increased fuel economy standards for new vehicles sold in those states.Compliance costs for our customers could require them to alter their spending, research and development plans, curtail sales, cease production or exit certain market segments characterized by lower fuel efficiency. Any of these actions could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. Company-Specific Risk Factors
 We have taken, and continue to take, cost-reduction actions. Although our process includes planning for potential negative consequences, the cost-reduction actions may expose us to additional production risk and could adversely affect our sales, profitability and ability to attract and retain employees. We have been reducing costs in all of our businesses and have discontinued product lines, exited businesses, consolidated manufacturing operations and reduced our employee population. The impact of these cost-reduction actions on our sales and profitability may be influenced by many factors including our ability to successfully complete these ongoing efforts, our ability to generate the level of cost savings we expect or that are necessary to enable us to effectively compete, delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, decline in employee morale and the potential inability to meet operational targets due to our inability to retainor recruit key employees. We operate as a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for cash to satisfy the obligations of the holding company. Dana Holding Corporation is a holding company. Our subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and own substantially all of our assets. Our cash flow and our ability to meet our obligations depend on the cash flow of our subsidiaries. In addition, the payment of funds in the form of dividends, intercompany payments, tax sharing payments and otherwise may be subject to restrictions under the laws of the countries of incorporation of our subsidiaries. Labor stoppages or work slowdowns at Dana, key suppliers or our customers could result in a disruption in our operations and have a material adverse effect on our businesses. We and our customers rely on our respective suppliers to provide parts needed to maintain production levels. We all rely on workforces represented by labor unions. Workforce disputes that result in work stoppages or slowdowns could disrupt operations of all of these businesses which in turn could have a material adverse effect on demand for the products we supply our customers. We could be adversely affected if we are unable to recover portions of our commodity costs (including costs of steel, other raw materials and energy) from our customers. We continue to work with our customers to recover a greater portion of our material cost increases. While we have achieved some success in these efforts to date, there is no assurance that commodity costs will not adversely impact our profitability in the future. We could be adversely affected if we experience shortages of components from our suppliers. A substantial portion of our annual cost of sales is driven by the purchase of goods and services. To manage and reduce these costs, we have been consolidating our supplier base. As a result, we are dependent on single sources of supply for some components of our products. We select our suppliers based on total value (including price, delivery and quality), taking into consideration their production capacities and financial 8  TABLE OF CONTENTScondition and we expect that they will be able to support our needs. However, there is no assurance that adverse financial conditions, including bankruptcies of our suppliers, reduced levels of production or other problems experienced by our suppliers will not result in shortages or delays in their supply of components to us or even in the financial collapse of one or more such suppliers. If we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers, particularly those who are sole sources and were unable to procure the components from other sources, we would be unable to meet our production schedulesfor some of our key products and to ship such products to our customers in a timely fashion, which would adversely affect our revenues, margins and customer relations. We will be engaging in acquisitions and joint ventures in the future and we could encounter unexpected difficulties integrating those businesses. We expect to engage in strategic acquisitions and joint ventures, which are intended to complement or expand our businesses. The success of this strategy will depend on our ability to successfully complete these transactions or arrangements, to integrate the businesses acquired in these transactions and to develop satisfactory working arrangements with our strategic partners in the joint ventures. We could encounter unexpected difficulties in completing these transactions and integrating the acquisitions with our existing operations. We also may not realize the degree or timing of benefits anticipated when we enter into a transaction. We could be adversely impacted by the costs of environmental, health, safety and product liability compliance. Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries that govern emissions to the air; discharges to water; the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials and the cleanup of contaminated properties. Historically, other than an EPA settlement as part of our bankruptcy proceedings, environmental costs related to our former and existing operations have not been material. However, there is no assurance that the costs of complying with current environmental laws and regulations, or those that may be adopted in the future, will not increase and adversely impact us.There is also no assurance that the costs of complying with current laws and regulations, or those that may be adopted in the future, that relate to health, safety and product liability matters will not adversely impact us. There is also a risk of warranty and product liability claims, as well as product recalls, in the commercial, off-highway and light vehicle markets, if our products fail to perform to specifications or cause property damage, injury or death. (See Notes 16 and 18 of our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on warranties.) We participate in certain multiemployer pension plans which are not fully funded. We contribute to certain multiemployer defined benefit pension plans for our union-represented employees in the U.S. in accordance with our collective bargaining agreements. Contributions are based on hours worked except in cases of layoff or leave where we generally contribute based on 40 hours per week for a maximum of one year. The plans are not fully funded as of December 31, 2009, the last date for which data is available. We could be held liable to the plans for our obligation, as well as those of other employers due to our participation in the plans. Contribution rates could increase if the plans are required to adopt a funding improvementplan, if the performance of plan assets does not meet expectations, or as a result of future collectively-bargained wage and benefit agreements. Risk Factors
 Related to our Securities Provisions in our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and Shareholders Agreement may discourage a takeover attempt. Certain provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, as well as the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Dana. Such provisions, including those regulating the nomination of directors, limiting who may call special stockholders meetings and eliminating stockholder action by written consent, together with the terms of our outstanding preferred stock, may make it more difficult for other persons, without the approval of our board of directors, to make a tender offer or otherwise acquire substantial amounts of common stock or tolaunch other takeover attempts that a stockholder might consider to be in such stockholders best interest. 9  TABLE OF CONTENTS"
11,DAN,DANA INC,2010-02-24,">Item 1A. Risk    Factors     We are impacted by events and conditions that affect the light    vehicle, medium/heavy vehicle and off-highway markets that we    serve, as well as by factors specific to Dana.  Among    the risks that could materially adversely affect our business,    financial condition or results of operations are the following,    many of which are interrelated. Risk Factors
    Related to the Markets We Serve Continuing    negative economic conditions in the United States and elsewhere    could have a substantial effect on our business.     Our business is tied to general economic and industry conditions    as demand for vehicles depends largely on the strength of the    economy, employment levels, consumer confidence levels, the    availability and cost of credit and the cost of    fuel.  Current economic conditions have reduced demand    for most vehicles.  This has had and could continue to    have a substantial impact on our business.     While we expect a modest economic recovery in 2010, negative    economic conditions could continue to impact our    business.  The overall market for new vehicle sales in    the United States declined significantly in 2009 and while we    expect partial recovery in 2010, our customers could reduce    their vehicle production in North America and, as a result,    demand for our products would continue to be adversely affected. Demand in our    non-U.S. markets    could also decline in response to overall economic conditions,    including changes in the global economy, the limited    availability of credit and fuel costs.     Our customers and suppliers could experience severe economic    constraints in the future, including    bankruptcy.  Adverse global economic conditions and    further deterioration could have a material adverse impact on    our financial position and results of operations. We could be    adversely impacted by the loss of any of our significant    customers, changes in their requirements for our products or    changes in their financial condition.     We are reliant upon sales to several significant    customers.  Sales to our ten largest customers    accounted for 56% of our overall revenue in 2009.  In    the U.S., the light vehicle industry faces an uncertain    future.  GM and Chrysler have already required    assistance through government loans and other companies in the    light vehicle industry may seek government    assistance.  Changes in our business relationships    with any of our large customers or in the timing, size and    continuation of their various programs could have a material    adverse impact on us.     The loss of any of these customers, the loss of business with    respect to one or more of their vehicle models on which we have    a high component content, or a further significant decline in    the production levels of such vehicles would continue to    negatively impact our business, results of operations and    financial condition.  We are continually bidding on    new business with these customers, as well as seeking to    diversify our customer base, but there is no assurance that our    efforts will be successful.  Further, to the extent    that the financial condition of our largest customers    deteriorates, including possible bankruptcies, mergers or    liquidations, or their sales otherwise decline, our financial    position and results of operations could be adversely affected. We may be    adversely impacted by changes in international legislative and    political conditions.     We operate in 23 countries around the world and we depend on    significant foreign suppliers and    vendors.  Legislative and political activities within    the countries where we conduct business, particularly in    emerging markets and less developed countries, could adversely    impact our ability to operate in those countries.  The    political situation in some countries creates a risk of the    seizure of our assets.  The political environment in    some of these countries could create instability in our    contractual relationships with no effective legal safeguards for    resolution of these issues.    11Table of ContentsWe may be    adversely impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar    relative to other currencies in the other countries in which we    do business.     Approximately 54% of our sales in 2009 were from operations    located in countries other than the U.S. Currency    variations can have an impact on our results (expressed in    U.S. dollars).  Currency variations can also    adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries    outside of the U.S. and margins on sales of products that    include components obtained from affiliates or other suppliers    located outside of the U.S. While the U.S. dollar has    generally weakened over the past year, strengthening of the    U.S. dollar against the euro and many other currencies of    countries in which we have operations could adversely affect our    results reported in U.S. dollars.  We use a    combination of natural hedging techniques and financial    derivatives to protect against foreign currency exchange rate    risks.  Such hedging activities may be ineffective or    may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial    impact resulting from currency variations. We may be    adversely impacted by new laws, regulations or policies of    governmental organizations related to increased fuel economy    standards and reduced greenhouse gas emissions, or changes in    existing ones.     It is anticipated that the number and extent of governmental    regulations related to fuel economy standards and greenhouse gas    emissions, and the costs to comply with them, will increase    significantly in the future.  In the U.S., the Energy    Independence and Security Act of 2007 requires significant    increases in the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE)    requirements applicable to cars and light trucks beginning with    the 2011 model year.  In addition, a growing number of    states are adopting regulations that establish carbon dioxide    emission standards that effectively impose similarly increased    fuel economy standards for new vehicles sold in those    states.  Compliance costs for our customers could    require them to alter their spending, research and development    plans, curtail sales, cease production or exit certain market    segments characterized by lower fuel efficiency.  Any    of these actions could adversely affect our financial position    and results of operations. Company-Specific    Risk Factors
 We have taken,    and continue to take, cost-reduction    actions.  Although our process includes planning for    potential negative consequences, the cost-reduction actions may    expose us to additional production risk and could adversely    affect our sales, profitability and ability to attract and    retain employees.     We have been reducing costs in all of our businesses and have    discontinued product lines, exited businesses, consolidated    manufacturing operations and reduced our employee    population.  The impact of these cost-reduction    actions on our sales and profitability may be influenced by many    factors including our ability to successfully complete these    ongoing efforts, our ability to generate the level of cost    savings we expect or that are necessary to enable us to    effectively compete, delays in implementation of anticipated    workforce reductions, decline in employee morale and the    potential inability to meet operational targets due to our    inability to retain or recruit key employees. Our amended Exit    Facility contains covenants that may constrain our    growth.     The amended financial covenants in our Exit Facility may hinder    our ability to finance future operations, make potential    acquisitions or investments, meet capital needs or engage in    business activities that may be in our best interest such as    future issuances of our common stock.  These    restrictions could hinder us from responding to changing    business and economic conditions and from implementing our    business plan. We may be unable    to comply with the financial covenants in our amended Exit    Facility.     The financial covenants in our amended Exit Facility require us    to achieve certain financial ratios based on levels of earnings    before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and certain    levels of restructuring and reorganization related costs    (Adjusted EBITDA), as defined in the amended Exit    12Table of Contents    Facility.  In November 2008, certain covenants of the    Exit Facility were amended to allow for future    compliance.  A failure to comply with these or other    covenants in the amended Exit Facility could, if we were unable    to obtain a waiver or another amendment of the covenant terms,    cause an event of default that could cause our loans under the    amended Exit Facility to become immediately due and    payable.  In addition, additional waivers or    amendments could substantially increase our cost of borrowing. We operate as a    holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for cash to    satisfy the obligations of the holding company.     Dana Holding Corporation is a holding company.  Our    subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and own substantially    all of our assets.  Our cash flow and our ability to    meet our obligations depends on the cash flow of our    subsidiaries.  In addition, the payments of funds in    the form of dividends, intercompany payments, tax sharing    payments and otherwise may be subject to restrictions under the    laws of the countries of incorporation of our subsidiaries. Labor stoppages    or work slowdowns at Dana, key suppliers or our customers could    result in a disruption in our operations and have a material    adverse effect on our business.     We and our customers rely on our respective suppliers to provide    parts needed to maintain production levels.  We all    rely on workforces represented by labor    unions.  Workforce disputes that result in work    stoppages or slowdowns could disrupt operations of all of these    businesses which in turn could have a material adverse effect on    demand for the products we supply our customers. We could be    adversely affected if we are unable to recover portions of our    commodity costs (including costs of steel, other raw materials    and energy) from our customers.     We continue to work with our customers to recover a greater    portion of our material costs.  While we have achieved    some success in these efforts to date, there is no assurance    that commodity costs will not adversely impact our profitability    in the future. We could be    adversely affected if we experience shortages of components from    our suppliers.     A substantial portion of our annual cost of sales is driven by    the purchase of goods and services.  To manage and    reduce these costs, we have been consolidating our supplier    base.  As a result, we are dependent on single sources    of supply for some components of our products.  We    select our suppliers based on total value (including price,    delivery and quality), taking into consideration their    production capacities and financial condition, and we expect    that they will be able to support our needs.  However,    there is no assurance that adverse financial conditions,    including bankruptcies of our suppliers, reduced levels of    production or other problems experienced by our suppliers will    not result in shortages or delays in their supply of components    to us or even in the financial collapse of one or more such    suppliers.  If we were to experience a significant or    prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our    suppliers, particularly those who are sole sources, and were    unable to procure the components from other sources, we would be    unable to meet our production schedules for some of our key    products and to ship such products to our customers in a timely    fashion, which would adversely affect our revenues, margins and    customer relations. We could be    adversely impacted by the costs of environmental, health, safety    and product liability compliance.     Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations    in the U.S. and other countries that govern emissions to    the air; discharges to water; the generation, handling, storage,    transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials and    the cleanup of contaminated properties.  Historically,    other than the EPA settlement for Hamilton (see Note 15 to    our consolidated financial statements in Item 8),    environmental costs related to our former and existing    operations have not been    13Table of Contents    material.  However, there is no assurance that the    costs of complying with current environmental laws and    regulations, or those that may be adopted in the future will not    increase and adversely impact us.     There is also no assurance that the costs of complying with    current laws and regulations, or those that may be adopted in    the future, that relate to health, safety and product liability    matters will not adversely impact us.  There is also a    risk of warranty and product liability claims, as well as    product recalls, in the commercial and automotive vehicle    industry if our products fail to perform to specifications or    cause property damage, injury or death.  (See    Note 16 of our consolidated financial statements in    Item 8 for additional information on warranties.) Our ability to    utilize our net operating loss carryforwards may be    limited.     Net operating tax loss carryforwards (NOLs) approximating $1,600    were available at December 31, 2009 to reduce future U.S    income tax liabilities.  Our ability to utilize these    NOLs may be limited as a result of certain change of control    provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code    (IRC).  We emerged from Chapter 11 with NOLs of    approximately $580, which are limited to annual utilization of    $85.  The additional NOLs accumulated since emergence    are not subject to limitation as of the end of    2009.  However, there can be no assurance that trading    in our shares will not effect another change in control under    the IRC which would further limit our ability to utilize our    available NOLs.  Such limitations may cause us to pay    income taxes earlier and in greater amounts than would be the    case if the NOLs were not subject to limitation. Risk Factors
    Related to our Securities Volatility is    possible in the market price of our common stock.     The market price of our common stock has been and may continue    to be volatile.  As the price of our common stock on    the New York Stock Exchange constantly changes, it is impossible    to predict whether the price of our common stock will rise or    fall.  Trading prices of our common stock will be    influenced by our financial condition, operating results and    prospects and by economic, financial and other factors, such as    prevailing interest rates, interest rate volatility and changes    in the automotive industry and competitors.  In    addition, general market conditions or our issuance of    substantial amounts of common stock could affect the price of    shares of our common stock. Provisions in our    Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and Shareholders    Agreement may discourage a takeover attempt.     Certain provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation    and Bylaws, as well as the General Corporation Law of the State    of Delaware, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or    preventing a change in control of Dana.  Such    provisions, including those regulating the nomination of    directors, limiting who may call special stockholders    meetings and eliminating stockholder action by written consent,    together with the terms of our outstanding preferred stock, may    make it more difficult for other persons, without the approval    of our board of directors, to make a tender offer or otherwise    acquire substantial amounts of common stock or to launch other    takeover attempts that a stockholder might consider to be in    such stockholders best interest.  In addition,    our Shareholders Agreement with the current holders of our    Series A Preferred Stock provides that such holders will    have approval rights with respect to certain corporate    transactions, including certain transactions involving a change    of control of Dana.  The existence of such approval    rights could discourage a takeover attempt. Holders of our    Series A Preferred Stock have limited approval rights with    respect to our business and may have conflicts of interest with    holders of our common stock in the future.     Under the terms of our Shareholders Agreement, the current    holders of our Series A Preferred Stock have limited    approval rights with respect to certain corporate transactions,    including an issuance of our common stock at a price below the    current market price (as defined in the Shareholders    14Table of Contents    Agreement).  There can be no assurance that they will    waive their rights or grant approvals in respect of future    transactions that may be in the best interests of the holders of    our common stock. Our adoption of    fresh start accounting could result in additional asset    impairments and may make comparisons of our financial position    and results of operations to prior periods more    difficult.     As required by GAAP, we adopted fresh start accounting effective    February 1, 2008.  This adoption increased the    value of our long-lived assets.  Subsequent    developments in our markets resulted in impairments of the fresh    start values during 2008 and 2009 and could result in additional    impairments in future periods.  Since fresh start    accounting required us to adjust all of our assets and    liabilities to their respective fair values, the consolidated    financial statements for periods after the emergence will not be    comparable to those of the periods prior to the emergence which    are presented on an historical basis.  Fresh start    accounting may make it more difficult to compare our    post-emergence financial position and results of operations to    those in the pre-emergence periods which could limit interest    and investment in our stock. "
10,DAN,DANA INC,2009-03-16,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors     We are impacted by events and conditions that affect the light    vehicle, commercial vehicle and off-highway markets that we    serve, as well as by factors specific to Dana. Among the risks    that could materially adversely affect our business, financial    condition or results of operations are the following, many of    which are interrelated. Risk Factors
 in    the Markets We Serve Continuing    negative economic conditions in the United States and elsewhere    could have a substantial effect on our business.     Our business is tied to general economic and industry conditions    as demand for vehicles depends largely on the strength of the    economy, employment levels, consumer confidence levels, the    availability and cost of credit and the cost of fuel. Current    economic conditions have reduced demand for most vehicles. This    has had and could continue to have a substantial impact on our    business.     Leading economic indicators such as employment levels and income    growth predict a continuing downward trend in the United States    economy. The overall market for new vehicle sales in the United    States is expected to decline significantly in 2009. Our    customers are likely to continue to reduce their vehicle    production even further in North America and, as a result,    demand for our products has been and is likely to continue to be    adversely affected.     Demand in our    non-U.S. markets    also continues to decline in response to overall economic    conditions, including changes in the global economy, the limited    availability of credit and fuel costs.     Our international as well as our domestic customers and    suppliers could experience severe economic constraints in the    future, including bankruptcy. Continuation of these global    economic conditions and further deterioration could have a    material adverse impact on our financial position and results of    operations. We could be    adversely impacted by the loss of any of our significant    customers, changes in their requirements for our products or    changes in their financial condition.     We are reliant upon sales to several significant customers.    Sales to our eight largest customers accounted for over 45% of    our overall revenue in 2008. In the United States, the    automobile industry faces an uncertain future. GM and Chrysler    have already required assistance through government loans under    the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and other companies in    the automobile industry may seek government assistance. Changes    in our business relationships with any of our large customers or    in the timing, size and continuation of their various programs    could have a material adverse impact on us.     The loss of any of these customers, the loss of business with    respect to one or more of their vehicle models on which we have    a high component content, or a further significant decline in    the production levels of such vehicles would continue to    negatively impact our business, results of operations and    financial condition. We are continually bidding on new business    with these customers, as well as seeking to diversify our    customer base, but there is no assurance that our efforts will    be successful. Further, to the extent that the financial    condition of our largest customers deteriorates, including    possible bankruptcies, mergers or liquidations, or their sales    otherwise decline, our financial position and results of    operations could be adversely affected. We may be    adversely impacted by changes in international legislative and    political conditions.     Legislative and political activities within the countries where    we conduct business, particularly in emerging and less developed    international countries, could adversely impact our ability to    operate in those countries. The political situation in some    countries creates a risk of the seizure of our assets. We    operate in 26 countries around the world and we depend on    significant foreign suppliers and vendors. The political    environment in some of these countries could create instability    in our contractual relationships with no effective legal    safeguards for resolution of these issues.    11Table of ContentsWe may be    adversely impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar    relative to other currencies in the overseas countries in which    we do business.     Approximately 59% of our sales were from operations located in    countries other than the United States. Currency variations can    have an impact on our results (expressed in U.S. dollars).    Currency variations can also adversely affect margins on sales    of our products in countries outside of the United States and    margins on sales of products that include components obtained    from affiliate or other suppliers located outside of the United    States. The recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against    the euro and many other currencies of countries in which we have    operations will adversely affect our results reported in    U.S. dollars. We use a combination of natural hedging    techniques and financial derivatives to protect against foreign    currency exchange rate risks. Such hedging activities may be    ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse    financial impact resulting from currency variations. Gains or    losses associated with hedging activities also may impact    operating results. We may be    adversely impacted by new laws, regulations or policies of    governmental organizations related to increased fuel economy    standards and reduced greenhouse gas emissions, or changes in    existing ones.     It is anticipated that the number and extent of governmental    regulations related to fuel economy standards and greenhouse gas    emissions, and the costs to comply with them, will increase    significantly in the future. In the United States the Energy    Independence and Security Act of 2007 requires significant    increases in the Corporate Average Fuel Economy requirements    applicable to cars and light trucks beginning with the 2011    model year. In addition, a growing number of states are adopting    regulations that establish carbon dioxide emission standards    that effectively impose similarly increased fuel economy    standards for new vehicles sold in those states. Compliance    costs for our customers could require them to alter their    spending, research and development plans, curtail sales, cease    production or exit certain market segments characterized by    lower fuel efficiency. Any of these actions could adversely    affect our financial position and results of operations. Company-Specific    Risk Factors
 Our amended Exit    Facility terms contain covenants that may constrain our    growth.     The amended financial covenants in our Exit Facility may hinder    our ability to finance future operations, make potential    acquisitions or investments, meet capital needs or engage in    business activities that may be in our best interest such as    future transactions involving our securities. These restrictions    could hinder us from responding to changing business and    economic conditions and from implementing our business plan. We may be unable    to comply with the financial covenants in our amended Exit    Facility.     The financial covenants in our amended Exit Facility require us    to achieve certain financial ratios based on levels of earnings    before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and certain    levels of restructuring and reorganization related costs    (EBITDA), as defined in the amended Exit Facility. In November    2008, certain covenants of the Exit Facility were amended to    allow for future compliance. A failure to comply with these or    other covenants in the amended Exit Facility could, if we were    unable to obtain a waiver or another amendment of the covenant    terms, cause an event of default that could cause our loans    under the amended Exit Facility to become immediately due and    payable. In addition, additional waivers or amendments could    substantially increase the cost of borrowing. In connection with    the November 2008 amendment our interest cost increased by    50 basis points, we repaid $150 of the term loan and we    incurred amendment fees. We operate as a    holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for cash to    satisfy the obligations of the holding company.     Dana Holding Corporation is a holding company. Our subsidiaries    conduct all of our operations and own substantially all of our    assets. Our cash flow and our ability to meet our obligations    depends on the cash flow of our subsidiaries. In addition, the    payments of funds in the form of dividends, intercompany    payments, tax    12Table of Contents    sharing payments and other forms may be subject to restrictions    under the laws of the countries of incorporation of our    subsidiaries. Labor stoppages    or work slowdowns at key suppliers of our customers could result    in a disruption in our operations and have a material adverse    effect on our business.     Our customers rely on other suppliers to provide them with the    parts they need to manufacture vehicles. Many of these    suppliers workforces are represented by labor unions.    Workforce disputes that result in work stoppages or slowdowns at    these suppliers could disrupt the operations of our customers    which could have a material adverse effect on demand for the    products we supply our customers. We could be    adversely affected if we are unable to recover portions of our    commodity costs (including costs of steel, other raw materials    and energy) from our customers.     As part of our reorganization initiatives, we have been working    with our customers to recover a greater portion of our commodity    costs. While we have achieved some success in these efforts to    date, there is no assurance that commodity costs will not    continue to adversely impact our profitability in the future. We could be    adversely affected if we experience shortages of components from    our suppliers.     We spend over $4,000 annually for purchased goods and services.    To manage and reduce these costs, we have been consolidating our    supply base. As a result, we are dependent on single sources of    supply for some components of our products. We select our    suppliers based on total value (including price, delivery and    quality), taking into consideration their production capacities    and financial condition, and we expect that they will be able to    support our needs. However, there is no assurance that adverse    financial conditions, including bankruptcies of our suppliers,    reduced levels of production or other problems experienced by    our suppliers will not result in shortages or delays in their    supply of components to us or even in the financial collapse of    one or more such suppliers. If we were to experience a    significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from    any of our suppliers, particularly those who are sole sources,    and were unable to procure the components from other sources, we    would be unable to meet our production schedules for some of our    key products and to ship such products to our customers in    timely fashion, which would adversely affect our revenues,    margins and customer relations. We could be    adversely impacted by the costs of environmental, health, safety    and product liability compliance.     Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations    in the U.S. and other countries that govern emissions to    the air; discharges to water; the generation, handling, storage,    transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials and    the cleanup of contaminated properties. Historically,    environmental costs other than the EPA settlement for Hamilton    (see Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements in    Item 8) related to our former and existing operations    have not been material. However, there is no assurance that the    costs of complying with current environmental laws and    regulations, or those that may be adopted in the future will not    increase and adversely impact us.     There is also no assurance that the costs of complying with    various laws and regulations, or those that may be adopted in    the future, that relate to health, safety and product liability    concerns will not adversely impact us. Our ability to    utilize our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited and    delayed.     We paid approximately $733 following emergence to fund    union-sponsored VEBAs for certain union employee benefit    obligations. We are currently working with the Internal Revenue    Service (IRS), through the pre-filing agreement program, to    evaluate applicable tax laws and regulations and confirm that    the amounts paid to the VEBAs in 2008 were deductible. There is    a risk that, if the payment is determined not to be wholly    deductible in 2008, the deductibility would instead occur over    time which delays recognition of our NOLs.    13Table of Contents    We emerged from bankruptcy with net operating loss carryforwards    (NOLs) of approximately $300 available to Dana. Certain    provisions of the tax code also limit our annual utilization of    the $300 of NOLs available at emergence to approximately $90 per    year. There can be no assurance that we will be able to utilize    all of our pre-emergence and any subsequent NOL benefits in the    future. Risk Factors
    Related to our Securities We may not be    able to maintain our listing with the New York Stock    Exchange.     On December 19, 2008, we received written notice from the    New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (NYSE) that we had fallen below    the NYSEs continued listing standard because over a 30    trading-day    period our total market capitalization was less than $100 and    the average 30    trading-day    closing price of our common stock had fallen below $1.00. We    notified the NYSE in January 2009 that we intend to resolve    these matters. The NYSE has now temporarily suspended its    requirement of a minimum 30    trading-day    closing price. Once this requirement resumes, we will have    approximately three months to comply.     There can be no assurances that we will be able to maintain our    listing. Continued non-compliance with the NYSEs continued    listing standards or delisting from the NYSE could negatively    impact our access to equity financing, which in turn could    materially and adversely affect our business, financial    condition and results of operations.     Our common stock could trade in the    over-the-counter    market which generally has significantly less liquidity than    securities traded on a national securities exchange, through    factors such as a reduction in the number of investors that will    consider investing in the securities, the number of market    makers in the securities, reduction in securities analyst and    news media coverage and lower market prices than might otherwise    be obtained. As a result, in the event of a delisting, holders    of shares of our common stock may find it difficult to resell    their shares at prices quoted in the market or at all. Volatility is    possible in the trading of our common stock.     Some of the holders who received common stock upon emergence may    not elect to hold their shares on a long-term basis. Sales by    these stockholders of a substantial number of shares could    significantly reduce the market price of our common stock.    Moreover, the perception that these stockholders might sell    significant amounts of our common stock could depress the    trading price of the stock for a considerable period. Such sales    of common stock, and the possibility thereof, could make it more    difficult for us to sell equity, or equity-related securities,    in the future at a time and price that we consider appropriate. Our adoption of    fresh start accounting could result in additional asset    impairments and may make comparisons of our financial position    and results of operations to prior periods more    difficult.     As required by GAAP, we adopted fresh start accounting effective    February 1, 2008. This adoption increased the value of our    long-lived assets. Subsequent developments in our markets    resulted in impairments of the fresh start values during 2008    and could result in additional impairments in future periods.    Since fresh start accounting required us to adjust all of our    assets and liabilities to their respective fair values, the    consolidated financial statements for periods after the    emergence will not be comparable to those of the periods prior    to the emergence which are presented on an historical basis.    Fresh start accounting may make it more difficult to compare our    post-emergence financial position and results of operations to    those in the pre-emergence periods which could limit investment    in our stock. One of our    stockholders has limited approval rights with respect to our    business and may have conflicts of interest with us in the    future.     In accordance with the Plan, Centerbridge owns preferred stock    and is entitled to vote on most matters presented to    stockholders on an as-converted basis. Centerbridge also has    certain approval rights, board representation and other rights    pursuant to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and a    shareholders agreement. These rights include the right to    approve a transaction involving a change of control of our    14Table of Contents    company, subject to being overridden by a two-thirds stockholder    vote. (See Note 12 to the financial statements in    Item 8 for additional information regarding    Centerbridges participation in the selection of our Board    of Directors and approval rights with respect to certain    transactions.)     Conflicts of interest may arise in the future between us and    Centerbridge. For example, Centerbridge and its affiliated    investors are in the business of making investments in companies    and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete    directly or indirectly with us. "

These statements represent the present expectations    of Dana and its consolidated subsidiaries based on current    information and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are    inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. Our plans,    actions and actual results could differ materially from our    present expectations due to a number of factors, including those    discussed below and elsewhere in this report (our 2007    Form 10-K)    and in other filings with the SEC.     We are impacted by events and conditions that affect the light    vehicle, commercial vehicle and off-highway industries that we    serve, as well as by factors specific to Dana. Among the risks    that could materially adversely affect our business, financial    condition or results of operations are the following, many of    which are interrelated. Company-Specific    Risk Factors
 Our Exit Facility    contains covenants that may constrain our growth.     The financial covenants in our Exit Facility may hinder our    ability to finance future operations, make potential    acquisitions or investments, meet capital needs or engage in    business activities that may be in our best interest such as    future transactions involving our securities. These restrictions    could hinder us from responding to changing business and    economic conditions and from implementing our business plan. We may be unable    to comply with the financial covenants in our Exit    Facility.     The financial covenants in our Exit Facility require us to    achieve certain financial ratios based on levels of earnings    before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and certain    levels of restructuring and reorganization related costs    (EBITDA), as defined in the Exit Facility. A failure to comply    with these or other covenants in the Exit Facility could, if we    were unable to obtain a waiver or an amendment of the covenant    terms, cause an event of default that would cause our loans    under the Exit Facility to become immediately due and payable.    In addition, a waiver or an amendment could substantially    increase the cost of borrowing. We operate as a    holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for cash to    satisfy the obligations of the holding company.     Dana Holding Corporation is a holding company. Our subsidiaries    conduct all of our operations and own substantially all of our    assets. Our cash flow and our ability to meet our obligations    depends on the cash flow of our subsidiaries. In addition, the    payments of funds in the form of dividends, intercompany    payments, tax sharing payments and other forms may be subject to    restrictions under the laws of the countries of incorporation of    our subsidiaries.    13Table of ContentsWe could be    adversely impacted by the loss of any of our significant    customers, changes in their requirements for our products or    changes in their financial condition.     We are reliant upon sales to a few significant customers. Sales    to Ford and GM were 30% of our overall revenue in 2007, while    sales to Toyota, PACCAR, Navistar, Chrysler, Daimler and Nissan    in the aggregate accounted for another 25%. Changes in our    business relationships with any of our large customers or in the    timing, size and continuation of their various programs could    have an adverse impact on us. The loss of any of these    customers, the loss of business with respect to one or more of    their vehicle models on which we have a high component content,    or a further significant decline in the production levels of    such vehicles would negatively impact our business, results of    operations and financial condition. We are continually bidding    on new business with these customers, as well as seeking to    diversify our customer base, but there is no assurance that our    efforts will be successful. Further, to the extent that the    financial condition of our largest customers deteriorates,    including a possible bankruptcy, or their sales otherwise    decline, our financial position and results of operations could    be adversely affected. Labor stoppages    or work slowdowns at key suppliers of our customers could result    in a disruption in our operations and have a material adverse    effect on our business.     Our customers rely on other suppliers to provide them with the    parts they need to manufacture vehicles. Many of these    suppliers workforces are represented by labor unions.    Workforce disputes that result in work stoppages or slowdowns at    these suppliers could disrupt the operations of our customers    which could have a material adverse effect on demand for the    products we supply our customers. We could be    adversely affected if we are unable to recover portions of our    high commodity costs (including costs of steel, other raw    materials and energy) from our customers.     For some time, high commodity costs have significantly impacted    our earnings. As part of our reorganization initiatives, we have    been working with our customers to recover a greater portion of    our commodity costs. While we have achieved some success in    these efforts to date, there is no assurance that commodity    costs will not continue to adversely impact our profitability in    the future. We could be    adversely affected if we experience shortages of components from    our suppliers.     We spend over $4,000 annually for purchased goods and services.    To manage and reduce these costs, we have been consolidating our    supply base. As a result, we are dependent on single sources of    supply for some components of our products. We select our    suppliers based on total value (including price, delivery and    quality), taking into consideration their production capacities    and financial condition, and we expect that they will be able to    support our needs. However, there is no assurance that strong    demand, capacity limitations or other problems experienced by    our suppliers will not result in occasional shortages or delays    in their supply of components to us. If we were to experience a    significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from    any of our suppliers, particularly those who are sole sources,    and were unable to procure the components from other sources, we    would be unable to meet our production schedules for some of our    key products and to ship such products to our customers in    timely fashion, which would adversely affect our revenues,    margins and customer relations. We could be    adversely impacted by the costs of environmental, health, safety    and product liability compliance.     Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations    in the U.S. and other countries that govern emissions to    the air; discharges to water; the generation, handling, storage,    transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials and    the cleanup of contaminated properties. Historically,    environmental costs with respect to our former and existing    operations have not been material. However, there is no    assurance that the costs of complying with current environmental    laws and regulations, or those that may be adopted in the future    will not increase and adversely impact us.    14Table of Contents    There is also no assurance that the costs of complying with    various laws and regulations, or those that may be adopted in    the future, that relate to health, safety and product liability    concerns will not adversely impact us. Our ability to    utilize net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) will be    limited.     The discharge of a debt obligation by a taxpayer for an amount    less than the recorded value generally creates cancellation of    indebtedness (COD) income, which must be included in the    taxpayers taxable income. In our case the discharge of the    debt was granted by the Bankruptcy Court pursuant to a plan of    reorganization approved by the court, and we will not be    required to recognize COD income as taxable income. However,    certain tax attributes otherwise available and of value to a    debtor are reduced by the amount of COD income. We have not    completed our analysis regarding the impact of COD income on our    tax attributes.     Based on our preliminary analysis, we believe that our    consolidated NOLs as of the Effective Date were eliminated and    other attributes were significantly reduced, including the tax    basis of assets, but 2008 post emergence payments will generate    tax deductions exceeding $700. Risk Factors
 in    the Markets We Serve We may be    adversely impacted by changes in national and international    economic, legislative and political conditions.     Our sales depend, in large part, on economic conditions in the    global light vehicle, commercial vehicle and off-highway OEM    markets that we serve. Demand in these markets fluctuates in    response to overall economic conditions, including changes in    general economic indicators, interest rate levels and, in our    vehicular markets, fuel costs. For example, higher gasoline    prices in 2007 contributed to weaker demand in North America for    certain vehicles for which we supply products, especially    full-size SUVs and    pick-up    trucks. If gasoline prices remain high or continue to rise, the    demand for such vehicles could weaken further and the recent    shift in consumer interest to passenger cars and CUVs, in    preference to SUVs and    pick-up    trucks, could be accelerated. This would have an adverse effect    on our business, as our product content on CUVs is less    significant than our content on    pick-up    trucks and SUVs. In particular, our structures business that    supplies the body-on-frame components for full-size SUVs does    not have significant content on CUVs.     We operate in 26 countries around the world and we depend on    significant foreign suppliers and vendors. Legislative and    political activities within the countries where we conduct    business, particularly in emerging and less developed    international countries, could adversely impact our ability to    operate in those countries. The political situation in some    countries creates a risk of the seizure of our assets. In    addition, the political environment could create instability in    our contractual relationships with no effective legal safeguards    for resolution of these issues. We may be    adversely impacted by the strength of other currencies, relative    to the U.S. dollar, in the overseas countries in which we do    business.     Approximately 54% of our sales were from our operations located    in countries other than the United States. Currency variations    can have an impact on our results (expressed in    U.S. dollars). Currency variations can also adversely    affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of    the United States and margins on sales of products that include    components obtained from affiliate or other suppliers located    outside of the United States. We use a combination of natural    hedging techniques and financial derivatives to protect against    foreign currency exchange rate risks. Such hedging activities    may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the    adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations.    Gains or losses associated with hedging activities also may    impact operating results.    15Table of ContentsWe may be    adversely impacted by new laws, regulations or policies of    governmental organizations related to increased fuel economy    standards and reduced greenhouse gas emissions, or changes in    existing ones.     It is anticipated that the number and extent of governmental    regulations related to fuel economy standards and greenhouse gas    emissions, and the costs to comply with them, will increase    significantly in the future. Recently, the United States enacted    the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, a new energy    bill that will require significant increases in the Corporate    Average Fuel Economy requirements applicable to cars and light    trucks beginning with the 2011 model year. In addition, a    growing number of states are adopting regulations that establish    carbon dioxide emission standards that effectively impose    similarly increased fuel economy standards for new vehicles sold    in those states. Compliance costs for our customers could    require them to alter their spending, research and development    plans, curtail sales, cease production or exit certain market    segments characterized by lower fuel efficiency. Any of these    actions could adversely affect our financial position and    results of operations. Negative economic    outlooks in the United States and elsewhere could have a    material adverse effect on our business.     Our business is tied to general economic and industry    conditions. Demand for vehicles depends largely on general    economic conditions, including the strength of the economy,    unemployment levels, consumer confidence levels, the    availability and cost of credit and the cost of fuel. The    decline in housing construction further reduced demand for    vehicles, particularly    pick-up    trucks and SUVs on which we provide significant content. Leading    economic indicators such as employment levels and income growth    predict a downward trend in the United States economy. The    overall market for new vehicle sales in the United States is    expected to decline in 2008, possibly significantly. Our    customers could reduce their vehicle production in North America    and, as a result, demand for our products would be adversely    affected. Risk Factors
    Related to our Securities There is limited    history of trading of our common stock, and volatility is    possible.     Our post-emergence common stock has traded for only a limited    period. Some of the holders who received common stock upon    emergence may not elect to hold their shares on a long-term    basis. Sales by these stockholders of a substantial number of    shares could significantly reduce the market price of our common    stock. Moreover, the perception that these stockholders might    sell significant amounts of our common stock could depress the    trading price of the stock for a considerable period. Such sales    of common stock, and the possibility thereof, could make it more    difficult for us to sell equity, or equity-related securities,    in the future at a time and price that we consider appropriate. Our adoption of    fresh start accounting could result in additional asset    impairments and may make comparisons of our financial position    and results of operations to prior periods more    difficult.     Our adoption of fresh start accounting upon emergence will    increase the value of our long lived assets. This increased    valuation could result in additional impairments in future    periods.     As required by GAAP, Dana adopted fresh start accounting    effective February 1, 2008. Fresh start accounting requires    us to adjust all of our assets and liabilities to their    respective fair values. As a result, the consolidated financial    statements for periods after the emergence will not be    comparable to those of the periods prior to the emergence which    are presented on an historical basis. Fresh start accounting may    make it more difficult to compare our post-emergence financial    position and results of operations to those in the pre-emergence    periods which could limit investment in our stock.    16Table of ContentsOne of our    stockholders has limited approval rights with respect to our    business and may have conflicts of interest with us in the    future.     In accordance with the Plan, Centerbridge owns preferred stock    and is entitled to vote on most matters presented to    stockholders on an as-converted basis. Centerbridge also has    certain approval rights, board representation and other rights    pursuant to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and a    shareholders agreement. These rights include the right to    approve a transaction involving a change of control of our    company, subject to being overridden by a two-thirds stockholder    vote. (See Note 11 to the financial statements in    Item 8 for additional information regarding    Centerbridges participation in the selection of our Board    of Directors and approval rights with respect to certain    transactions.)     Conflicts of interest may arise in the future between us and    Centerbridge. For example, Centerbridge and its affiliated    investors are in the business of making investments in companies    and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete    directly or indirectly with us. "
9,DAN,DANA INC,2007-03-20,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors General     We are impacted by events and conditions that affect the light    vehicle, commercial vehicle and off-highway industries that we    serve, as well as by factors specific to our company. Among the    risks that could materially adversely affect our business,    financial condition or results of operations are the following,    many of which are interrelated.    12Table of Contents Bankruptcy-Related    Risk Factors
 We are    operating under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and are    subject to the risks and uncertainties of    bankruptcy     For the duration of the Bankruptcy Cases, our operations and our    ability to execute our business strategy will be subject to the    risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy, including    our ability to (i) operate within the restrictions and the    liquidity limitations of our DIP Credit Agreement;    (ii) resolve issues with creditors and other third parties    whose interests may differ from ours; (iii) obtain    Bankruptcy Court approval with respect to motions we file from    time to time, including timely approval of transactions outside    the ordinary course of business that may present opportunities    for us; (iv) resolve the claims made against us in    bankruptcy for amounts not exceeding our recorded liabilities    subject to compromise; (v) attract and retain customers;    (vi) retain critical suppliers and service providers on    acceptable terms; (vii) attract, motivate and retain key    employees; (viii) fund and execute our business plan; and    (ix) develop, prosecute, confirm and consummate a plan of    reorganization. Because of these risks and uncertainties, we    cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the reorganization    process and there is no certainty about our ability to continue    as a going concern.     As a result of our bankruptcy filing, realization of our assets    and liquidation of our liabilities are subject to uncertainty.    During the bankruptcy proceedings, we may sell or otherwise    dispose of assets and liquidate or settle liabilities for    amounts other than those reflected in our consolidated financial    statements with Bankruptcy Court approval or as permitted in the    normal course of business. Further, our plan of reorganization    could materially change the amounts and classifications reported    in our historical consolidated financial statements, which do    not give effect to any adjustments to the carrying value of    assets or amounts of liabilities that might be necessary as a    consequence of confirmation of a plan of reorganization. We may be    unable to emerge from bankruptcy as a sustainable, viable    business unless we successfully implement our reorganization    initiatives     It is critical to our successful emergence from bankruptcy that    we (i) achieve positive margins for our products by    obtaining substantial price increases from our customers;    (ii) recover or otherwise provide for increased material    costs through renegotiation or rejection of various customer    programs; (iii) restructure our wage and benefit programs    to create an appropriate labor and benefit cost structure;    (iv) address the excessive cash requirements of the legacy    pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities that we    have accumulated over the years; and (v) achieve a    permanent reduction and realignment of our overhead costs. We    are taking actions to achieve those objectives, but there is no    assurance that we will be successful. We may be    unable to comply with the financial covenants in our DIP Credit    Agreement unless we improve our profitability     Our DIP Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that    require us to achieve certain levels of earnings before    interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and restructuring    and reorganization related costs (EBITDAR), as defined in the    agreement. If we are unable to achieve the results that are    contemplated in our business plan, we may be unable to comply    with the EBITDAR covenants. A failure to comply with these or    other covenants in the DIP Credit Agreement could, if we were    unable to obtain a waiver or an amendment of the covenant terms,    cause an event of default that would accelerate our loans under    the agreement. Risk Factors
 in    the Vehicle Markets We Serve We may be    adversely impacted by changes in national and international    economic conditions     Our sales depend, in large part, on economic conditions in the    global light vehicle, commercial vehicle and off-highway    original equipment (OE) markets that we serve. Demand in these    markets fluctuates in response to overall economic conditions,    including changes in general economic indicators, interest rate    levels and, in our vehicular markets, fuel costs. For example,    higher gasoline prices in 2006 contributed to    13Table of Contents    weaker demand in North America for certain vehicles for which we    supply products, especially full-size SUVs. If gasoline prices    remain high or continue to rise, the demand for such vehicles    could weaken further and recent consumer interest in passenger    cars and CUVs, in preference to SUVs, could be accelerated. This    would have an adverse effect on our business, as our product    content on CUVs is less significant than our content on SUVs. We may be    adversely affected by evolving conditions in the supply base for    light and commercial vehicles     The competitive environment among suppliers to the global OE    vehicle manufacturers has been changing in recent years, as    these manufacturers seek to outsource more components, modules    and systems and to develop low-cost suppliers, primarily outside    the U.S. As a result, suppliers in these sectors have    experienced substantial consolidation and new or larger    competitors may emerge who could significantly impact our    business.     In addition, an increasing number of North American suppliers    are now operating in bankruptcy and supplier bankruptcies could    disrupt the supply of components to our OEM customers and    adversely affect their demand for our products. Company-Specific    Risk Factors
 We could be    adversely impacted by the loss of any of our significant    customers or changes in their requirements for our    products     We are reliant upon sales to a few significant customers. Sales    to Ford and GM were 32% of our overall revenue in 2006, while    sales to Chrysler, PACCAR, Navistar, Renault-Nissan, Volvo Truck    and Toyota in the aggregate accounted for another 30%. Changes    in our business relationships with any of our large customers or    in the timing, size and continuation of their various programs    could have an adverse impact on us. The loss of any of these    customers, the loss of business with respect to one or more of    their vehicle models on which we have a high component content,    or a further significant decline in the production levels of    such vehicles would impact our business, results of operations    and financial condition. We are continually bidding on new    business with these customers, as well as seeking to diversify    our customer base, but there is no assurance that our efforts    will be successful. We could be    adversely affected if we are unable to recover portions of our    high commodity costs (including costs of steel, other raw    materials, and energy) from our customers     For some time, high commodity costs have significantly impacted    our earnings, as well as the results of others in our industry.    As part of our reorganization initiatives, we are working with    our customers to recover a greater portion of our commodity    costs. While we have achieved some success in these efforts to    date, there is no assurance that commodity costs will not    continue to adversely impact our profitability. We could be    adversely affected if we experience shortages of components from    our suppliers     We spend over $4,000 annually for purchased goods and services.    To manage and reduce these costs, we have been consolidating our    supply base. As a result, we are dependent on single sources of    supply for some components of our products. We select our    suppliers based on total value (including price, delivery and    quality), taking into consideration their production capacities    and financial condition, and we expect that they will be able to    support our needs. However, there is no assurance that strong    demand, capacity limitations or other problems experienced by    our suppliers will not result in occasional shortages or delays    in their supply of components to us. If we were to experience a    significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from    any of our suppliers, particularly those who are sole sources,    and were unable to procure the components from other sources, we    would be unable to meet our production schedules for some of our    key products and to ship such products to our customers in    timely fashion, which would adversely affect our revenues,    margins and customer relations.    14Table of Contents We may be    unable to complete the divestiture of our non-core fluid    products and pump products businesses as    contemplated     We announced plans to divest our fluid products and pump    products businesses and classified them as discontinued    operations in our financial statements in 2005. The abundance of    assets currently available for sale in the light vehicle    industry could affect our ability to complete these divestitures    and/or    impact the proceeds that we receive. Moreover, during our    bankruptcy proceedings, there may be limitations on the terms    and conditions that we can offer to potential purchasers of    these operations. Failure to complete these strategic    divestitures would place further pressure on our profitability    and cash flow and would divert our focus from our core    businesses. We may be    unable to renegotiate expiring collective bargaining agreements    with U.S. and Canadian unionized employees on satisfactory    terms     The achievement of our reorganization goals will depend in large    part on the labor and benefits costs that we are able to reduce    through negotiations with our U.S. and Canadian union    organizations and through the bankruptcy process. There is no    assurance that we will be able to reduce this significant part    of our cost structure. In addition, our efforts to secure these    cost savings could result in work stoppages by our unionized    employees or similar disturbances which could disrupt our    ability to meet our customers supply requirements. We could be    adversely affected by the costs of our asbestos-related product    liability claims     We have exposure to asbestos-related claims and litigation    because some of our automotive products in the past contained    asbestos. At the end of 2006, we had approximately 73,000 active    pending asbestos-related product liability claims, including    6,000 that were settled and awaiting documentation and payment.    A substantial increase in the costs to resolve these claims or    changes in the amount of available insurance could adversely    impact us, as could the enactment of U.S. federal    legislation relating to asbestos personal injury claims. We could be    adversely impacted by the costs of environmental    compliance     Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations    in the U.S. and other countries that govern emissions to    the air; discharges to water; the generation, handling, storage,    transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials; and    the cleanup of contaminated properties. Currently, environmental    costs with respect to our former and existing operations are not    material. However, there is no assurance that the costs of    complying with current environmental laws and regulations, or    those that may be adopted in the future, will not increase and    adversely impact us. "
0,DAN,DANA INC,2006-04-27,"  Risk Factors
General     We may be impacted by events and conditions that affect theautomotive, commercial vehicle and off-highway industries thatwe serve, as well as by factors specific to our company. Somerisks are interrelated and it is possible that some risks couldtrigger other risks described below. Among the risks that couldmaterially adversely affect our business, financial condition orresults of operations are the following.     Dana Corporation and forty of its wholly-owned subsidiariesfiled for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the BankruptcyCode on March 3, 2006 and are subject to the risks anduncertainties associated with the Bankruptcy Cases. For theduration of the Bankruptcy Cases, our operations and our abilityto execute our business strategy will be subject to the risksand uncertainties associated with bankruptcy. These risksinclude our ability to continue as a going concern; operatewithin the restrictions and the liquidity limitations of the DIPfacility; obtain Bankruptcy Court approval with respect tomotions filed in the Bankruptcy Cases from time to time;develop, prosecute, confirm and consummate a plan ofreorganization; obtain and maintain normal terms with suppliersand service providers and maintain contracts that are criticalto our operations; attract, motivate and retain key employees;attract and retain customers; and fund and execute our businessplan. We will also be subject to risks and uncertainties withrespect to the actions and decisions of the creditors and otherthird parties who have interests in the Bankruptcy Cases thatmay be inconsistent with our plans.10Table of Contents     These risks and uncertainties could affect our businesses andoperations in various ways. For example, negative events orpublicity associated with the Bankruptcy Cases could adverselyaffect our sales and relationships with our customers, as wellas with suppliers and employees, which in turn could adverselyaffect our operations and financial condition. Also, pursuant tothe Bankruptcy Code, we need Bankruptcy Court approval fortransactions outside the ordinary course of business, which maylimit our ability to respond timely to certain events or takeadvantage of certain opportunities. Because of the risks anduncertainties associated with the Bankruptcy Cases, we cannotpredict or quantify the ultimate impact that events occurringduring the reorganization process will have on our business,financial condition and results of operations and there is nocertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern.     As a result of the Chapter 11 filing, realization of assets andliquidation of liabilities are subject to uncertainty. Whileoperating under the protection of Chapter 11 of theBankruptcy Code, and subject to Bankruptcy Court approval orotherwise as permitted in the normal course of business, we maysell or otherwise dispose of assets and liquidate or settleliabilities for amounts other than those reflected in theconsolidated financial statements. Further, a plan ofreorganization could materially change the amounts andclassifications reported in the consolidated historicalfinancial statements, which do not give effect to anyadjustments to the carrying value of assets or amounts ofliabilities that might be necessary as a consequence ofconfirmation of a plan of reorganization.     The DIP facility includes financial and other covenants thatimpose substantial restrictions on the Debtors financialand business operations. The DIP facility includes financialcovenants that, among other things, require us to achievecertain levels of EBITDAR (earnings before interest, taxes,depreciation, amortization and restructuring and reorganizationrelated costs, as defined in the facility). For additionalinformation about the financial covenants, see Note 17 toour consolidated financial statements. If we are unable toachieve the results that are contemplated in our business plan,we may be unable to comply with the EBITDAR covenant.     Furthermore, the DIP facility restricts our ability, among otherthings, to contract or incur additional indebtedness, paydividends, make investments (including acquisitions) or sellassets. If we fail to comply with the covenants in the DIPfacility and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment of theDIP facility, an event of default will occur thereunder. The DIPfacility contains other events of defaults customary for DIPfinancings, including a change of control.     Our business is subject to being adversely affected by thecyclical nature of the vehicular markets we serve. Ourfinancial performance depends, in large part, on the varyingconditions in the global automotive and commercial vehicle OEmarkets that we serve. Demand in these global automotive,commercial vehicle and off-highway OE markets fluctuates inresponse to overall economic conditions and is particularlysensitive to changes in interest rate levels and changes in fuelcosts.     Changes in national and international economic conditionsthat affect our markets may adversely impact our sales.Higher gasoline prices in 2005 have contributed to weaker demandfor certain vehicles for which we supply components, especiallyfull-size sport utility vehicles (SUVs). Continued increases inthe price of gasoline could weaken further the demand for suchvehicles and accelerate recent consumer interest in crossoverutility vehicles (CUVs) in preference to SUVs. This would havean adverse effect on our business, as our content on CUVs isless significant than our content on SUVs.     Our sales may be adversely affected by the change in emissionstandards for commercial vehicles in the U.S. in 2007.More stringent heavy-truck emissions regulations will takeeffect in 2007 in the U.S. commercial truck market. Webelieve that 2006 will again be a strong year for theheavy-truck sales in advance of the new standards, which willadd cost to the vehicles, but we are projecting that demand willdecline significantly in 2007 after the pre-buying, and thisdecline could have a material adverse effect on our business.     We are reliant upon sales to a few significant customers.Sales to Ford, GM and DaimlerChrysler were 43% of our overallrevenue in 2005, while sales to PACCAR (Kenworth/ Peterbuilt),International (Navistar), Renault-Nissan, Volvo Truck and Toyotaaccounted for another 20%. Changes in our business11Table of Contentsrelationships with these customers and in the timing, size andcontinuation of their various programs could have an adverseimpact on us. The loss of any of these customers, the loss ofbusiness with respect to one or more of their vehicle modelsthat use our products, or a significant decline in theproduction levels of such vehicles could have an adverse effecton our business, results of operations and financial condition.     We are faced with continued price reduction pressure from ourOEM customers. A challenge that we and other suppliers tothe vehicular markets face is the effect of continued pricereduction pressure from our customers. Our largest customers,the U.S.-based lightvehicle OEMs, in particular have experienced market shareerosion tonon-U.S.-based lightvehicle manufacturers over the past few years, which has putpressure on their profitability. In response, they continue toseek price reductions from their suppliers.     We could be adversely impacted by changes in the volume andmix of vehicles containing our products. Our results dependnot only on the volume of products we sell, but the overallproduct mix. Certain products are more profitable than others.Shifts in demand away from our higher margin products couldadversely affect our business. While we are continually biddingand quoting on new business opportunities to add to our book ofnew business and are focused on profitable, revenue growth thatwill generate targeted returns, there can be no assurance thatour efforts will be successful.     Further automotive supplier bankruptcies or labor unrest maydisrupt the supply of components to our OEM customers, adverselyaffecting their demand for our products. The bankruptcy orinsolvency of other automotive suppliers or work stoppages orslowdowns due to labor unrest that may affect these suppliers orour OEM customers could lead to supply disruptions that couldhave an adverse effect on our business.     The evolving nature of the competitive environment in the OEautomotive and commercial vehicle sectors could adversely affectus. In recent years, the competitive environment amongsuppliers to the global OE manufacturers has changedsignificantly as these manufacturers have sought to outsourcemore vehicular components, modules and systems and to developsuppliers outside the U.S. In addition, these sectors haveexperienced substantial consolidation. There is no assurancethat new or larger competitors will not significantly impact ourbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.     We continue to face high commodity costs (including steel,other raw materials, and energy) that we cannot recoup in ourproduct pricing. Increasing commodity costs continued tohave a significant impact on our results, and those of others inour industry, in 2005. Steel surcharges and higher steel pricesresulting from ongoing limited steel production capacity andhigh demand reduced our pre-tax income in our continuingoperations by $196 in 2005.     We may not be able to complete the divestiture of ournon-core engine hard parts, fluid products and pump productsbusinesses in the current market atmosphere. We announced inlate 2005 that three businesses (engine hard parts, fluidproducts and pump products) would be divested and classifiedthem as discontinued operations in our financial statementsduring the fourth quarter. The abundance of assets currentlyavailable for sale in the automotive industry could affect ourability to complete these divestitures and/or the proceeds thatwe are ultimately able to derive from these transactions.Moreover, while we are in Chapter 11, there may be limitationson the terms and conditions that we can offer to potentialpurchasers of these operations. Failure to complete thesestrategic transactions could place further pressure on ourprofitability and cash flow as well as our ability to focus onour core businesses.     We may be unable to complete the operational restructuring inour Automotive Systems Group and our Commercial Vehicle businessand the dissolution of our Mexican joint venture with DESC, orto achieve projected cost savings and improved operationalefficiencies. The operational restructuring in ASG and thedissolution of our Mexican joint venture are designed to balancecapacity, enhance manufacturing efficiencies, and take advantageof lower cost locations. We are also implementing a number ofcost savings programs and productivity improvement initiatives,such as lean manufacturing and VA/ VE (value-added/valueengineering programs) in our operations. Successfulimplementation of these initiatives is critical to our futurecompetitiveness and ability to improve our profitability.However, there can no assurances that these efforts will besuccessful in this regard.12Table of Contents     We could be adversely affected if we experience shortages ofcomponents from our suppliers. We spend approximately $4,500annually for purchased goods and services. To manage and reducethese costs, we have been consolidating our supply base. As aresult, we are dependent on single sources of supply for somecomponents of our products. We select our suppliers based ontotal value (including price, delivery and quality), taking intoconsideration their production capacities and financialcondition, and we expect that they will be able to support ourneeds. However, there can be no assurance that strong demand,capacity limitations or other problems experienced by oursuppliers will not result in occasional shortages or delays intheir supply of components to us.

Asubstantial increase in the costs to resolve these claims orchanges in the amount of available insurance could adverselyimpact us, as could the enactment of proposed U.S. federallegislation relating to asbestos personal injury claims.     We could be adversely impacted by environmental laws andregulations. Our operations are subject to U.S. andnon-U.S. environmentallaws and regulations governing emissions to air; discharges towater; the generation, handling, storage, transportation,treatment and disposal of waste materials; and the cleanup ofcontaminated properties. Currently, environmental costs withrespect to our former and existing operations are not material,but there is no assurance that we will not be adversely impactedby such costs, liabilities or claims in the future, either underpresent laws and regulations or those that may be adopted orimposed in the future"
